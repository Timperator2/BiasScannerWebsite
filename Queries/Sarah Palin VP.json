        "Text": "    Sept 1 (Reuters) - Here are some facts about Republican  vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and how her selection  could affect the ticket headed by Sen. John McCain.      * Palin was sworn in as Alaska's youngest and first woman  governor in December 2006. Born in Sandpoint, Idaho, Feb. 11,  1964, she moved to Alaska with her parents as an infant.      * Palin is a darling of U.S. conservatives because of her  record on tax cuts, opposition to abortion and other issues. A  devout Christian, her place on the ticket may help shore up  McCain with the Republican Party's Christian base.      * Palin, 44, announced on Monday that her 17-year-old  unmarried daughter, Bristol, is pregnant and will keep the baby  and marry the father.      * The disclosure was made as a way to rebut rumors  circulating on liberal blog sites that Gov. Palin herself had  faked a pregnancy in order to cover up Bristol's pregnancy.      * Gov. Palin, who is staunchly anti-abortion, gave birth in  April to Trig Palin, her fifth child, a son born with Down  syndrome.      * Palin remains under investigation by Alaska's state  legislature to determine if she fired a public safety  commissioner after he declined to fire a state trooper who had  divorced Palin's sister.      * Democrats contend that Palin lacks experience to be a  heartbeat away from the presidency and say her selection  weakens McCain's argument their candidate Barack Obama, a  first-term U.S. senator, is too green to be president.

        "Text": "    Sept 3 (Reuters) - Here are some facts about Sarah Palin,  who rose quickly from small-town mayor to one of the most  popular governors in Alaskan history before her surprise  selection as Republican John McCain's vice presidential running  mate.      * Born in Sandpoint, Idaho, on Feb. 11, 1964, she moved to  Alaska with her parents as an infant. As a star on the state  champion Wasilla High School girls' basketball team, she was  known as 'Sarah Barracuda' for her aggressive play. She  graduated in 1987 from the University of Idaho, where she  studied journalism. She worked as a sports reporter at an  Anchorage television station in 1988.      * She entered politics in 1992 by running for the city  council in Wasilla, a town outside Anchorage that then had  about 5,000 residents. She was re-elected to a second term in  1995, and became Wasilla's mayor in 1996.      * She gained statewide fame as a whistle-blower calling  attention to ethical violations by high-ranking Republican  officials in Alaska, including the chairman of the state  Republican party and was sworn in as the state's youngest and  first woman governor in December 2006.      * As governor, Palin has spoken out against corruption,  battled for funding from major oil producers and convinced the  legislature to give a $1,200 'energy rebate' to nearly every  Alaskan. Her approval rating in the state stands at 80  percent.      * Palin is under investigation by Alaska's state  legislature to determine whether she fired a public safety  commissioner after he declined to fire a state trooper who had  divorced Palin's sister. Palin has hired a private lawyer in  the probe.     * Palin married her high school sweetheart, Todd Palin, in  1988. A champion snowmachine racer, Todd Palin is a commercial  fisherman who has worked for BP and has been a production  operator in oil fields on Alaska's North Slope.     * Palin, who has five children including a son born in April  with Down Syndrome and an unmarried 17-year-old who is  pregnant, is favored by social conservatives because of her  opposition to abortion, devout Christianity and lifetime  membership in the National Rifle Association.     * In 1984, Palin won the Miss Wasilla pageant, and finished  second in the Miss Alaska pageant, at which she was named 'Miss  Congeniality.

        "Text": "     Sept 3 (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John  McCain's newly chosen running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin,  created an immediate stir with news that she is the subject of  a state ethics probe and her unmarried teenage daughter is  pregnant.      Palin will accept the nomination on Wednesday in a speech  to the Republican convention. Here are some potential scenarios  for her candidacy and its impact on the Nov. 4 presidential  election against Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama  and his No. 2, Joe Biden.      - The choice of Palin, 44, a conservative abortion rights  opponent with a record of bucking the Republican establishment  in Alaska, has rallied the conservative base to McCain, who has  struggled to win over that crucial constituency.      Her speech will give the party a chance to answer questions  about her familiarity with domestic and foreign policy issues,  and possibly address the issue of her 17-year-old daughter's  pregnancy and the investigation into whether she abused her  power in having a public safety commissioner fired in Alaska.      'She'll be greeted rapturously because the delegates are  very conservative, as is she,' University of Virginia political  analyst Larry Sabato said of her convention appearance. 'She's  become their heroine. But what the delegates think and what the  country thinks are probably two different things.'      - The selection of the political unknown has raised  questions about McCain's judgment and the degree to which his  campaign investigated Palin's background. That is a distraction  that could hurt the campaign's efforts to generate momentum for  the election battle with Obama.      'My vetting process was completely thorough and I'm  grateful for the results,' McCain told reporters in  Philadelphia.      - Palin's slot on the ticket is secure, but new revelations  or scandals from Alaska could threaten her standing. It would  take a lot, however, to dump her two months before the  election.      'If he drops her, the election is over. There's zero chance  that he'll drop her,' Sabato said.

        "Text": "Can you believe Sarah Palin is still getting trashed eight days after the election? Can you believe she's still getting as much or more attention than President-elect Obama? Something is going on here.\n\nWednesday, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd ran yet another analysis of Governor Palin. But why? She lost. She's not going to be vice president.\n\nIn her column just out, she wrote: \"After her brutal transformation by the McCain campaign into a shopaholic, whack-job diva, Palin is now trying to unmake that makeover and morph from uptown cloistered girl back to down-home accessible girl.\"\n\nMs. Dowd goes on to cite reporting by The Washington Post that the governor spent even more money, this time on silk boxer shorts for her husband and spray tanners, above and beyond the original $150,000 already reported.\n\nNow, my question is: Who cares? I believe Palin when she says the RNC bought the clothes.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGOV. SARAH PALIN: The criticism that, you know, I took time out to run into Neiman Marcus or Sax, I don't think I've ever set foot in either one of those stores and, of course, didn't know the New York stylist whom they had hired or anything else.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWell, \"Talking Points\" is simply amazed the press is still talking about this in the face of a dangerous economy and the anticipation of a relatively inexperienced new president.\n\nBut there are some lessons here, and the first one is about loyalty. After Sarah Palin was hammered by some McCain staffers, it took the senator six days before he publicly stood up for her. That happened on the Leno program last night.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: I'm just very proud to have had Sarah Palin and her family, a wonderful family.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOK, but let me ask you something. If you knew a friend was being humiliated, would it take you six days to defend her? If so, you're not much of a friend.\n\nOn \"The Radio Factor\" Wednesday, Juan Williams said he thinks McCain just doesn't care about the issue, and that rings true. But McCain should have stood up sooner, no question.\n\nAs for Governor Palin, the liberal press wants to destroy her mainly because of her pro-life belief. And some Republicans believe she's not smart enough to run the country. So she continues to get it from both sides.\n\nBut the very fact that we are still talking about Sarah Palin proves the woman remains a force in America. It will be fascinating to see what happens to her.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nOur pal Donald Trump often does some nice things with his assets, and here's another one. He's been housing actress Jennifer Hudson and her family after the brutal murders of her mother, brother and young nephew. Mr. Trump's putting them up for free at one of his hotels, and for that, he's a patriot.\n\nOn the pinhead front, actor Brad Garrett, who gained a measure of fame in \"Everybody Loves Raymond,\" is being investigated by the police after this confrontation:\n\nClick here to watch \"Pinheads & Patriots.\"\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're a big star, man.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, leave him alone.\n\nBRAD GARRETT, ACTOR: That's enough. That's enough.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I didn't touch you.\n\nGARRETT: Oh, you would love that, right.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You did.\n\nGARRETT: Oh, did I really? Go get a real job.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nNow, we sympathize with all famous people because the paparazzi are ruthless. But Mr. Garrett needs to calm down and stop being a pinhead.",

        "Text": " (Adds dropped word in 2nd paragraph)      Sept 2 (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John  McCain's newly chosen running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin,  created an immediate stir with news that she is the subject of  a state ethics probe and her unmarried teenage daughter is  pregnant.      Palin will accept the nomination on Wednesday in a speech  to the Republican convention. Here are some potential scenarios  for her candidacy and its impact on the Nov. 4 presidential  election against Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama  and his No. 2, Joe Biden.      - The choice of Palin, 44, a conservative abortion rights  opponent with a record of bucking the Republican establishment  in Alaska, has rallied the conservative base to McCain, who has  struggled to win over that crucial constituency.      Her speech will give the party a chance to answer questions  about her familiarity with domestic and foreign policy issues,  and possibly address the issue of her 17-year-old daughter's  pregnancy and the investigation into whether she abused her  power in having a public safety commissioner fired in Alaska.      'She'll be greeted rapturously because the delegates are  very conservative, as is she,' University of Virginia political  analyst Larry Sabato said of her convention appearance. 'She's  become their heroine. But what the delegates think and what the  country thinks are probably two different things.'      - The selection of the political unknown has raised  questions about McCain's judgment and the degree to which his  campaign investigated Palin's background. That is a distraction  that could hurt the campaign's efforts to generate momentum for  the election battle with Obama.      'My vetting process was completely thorough and I'm  grateful for the results,' McCain told reporters in  Philadelphia.      - Palin's slot on the ticket is secure, but new revelations  or scandals from Alaska could threaten her standing. It would  take a lot, however, to dump her two months before the  election.      'If he drops her, the election is over. There's zero chance  that he'll drop her,' Sabato said.

        "Text": "Wednesday morning, NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell reported that Governor Palin's clothing is very expensive, and Ms. Mitchell is apparently upset about that. It's the usual from NBC News, trying to diminish the McCain-Palin ticket any way they can.\n\nBut far more troubling \u2014 far more troubling \u2014 was an interview Tuesday on CNN. Stay with me here because this is very important.\n\nWriting in the National Review this week, Byron York said: \"Watching press coverage of the Republican candidate for vice president, it's sometimes hard to decide whether Sarah Palin is incompetent, stupid, unqualified, corrupt, backward, or all of the above. Palin, the governor of Alaska, has faced more criticism than any vice presidential candidate since 1988.\"\n\nNow Mr. York was clearly criticizing press bias in that paragraph, no question about that. Well, shortly after the article appeared, Sarah Palin was interviewed by CNN reporter Drew Griffin, and here's what happened:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDREW GRIFFIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Governor, you've been mocked in the press. The press has been pretty hard on you. The Democrats have been pretty hard on you. But also some conservatives have been pretty hard on you as well. The National Review had a story saying that, you know, I can't tell if Sarah Palin is incompetent, stupid, unqualified, corrupt, or all of the above.\n\nSARAH PALIN: Who wrote that one?\n\nGRIFFIN: That was in the National Review. I don't have the author.\n\nPALIN: I'd like to talk to that person.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nShe doesn't have to talk to that person. Isn't that incredible?\n\nNow Griffin, the guy, totally distorted what York wrote in the article, and then he ambushes Palin with the distortion. She has no idea what he's talking about.\n\nNow I haven't been critical of CNN during the campaign. They've been pretty honest in their coverage, I believe. But that was off the chart dishonest.\n\nSo we called CNN for comment very early in the morning. We said look, you know, are you going to apologize? What are you going to do? They wouldn't comment. Apparently, there's no apology in the works, no retraction. It's unbelievable. It's hard to believe. In fact, the whole campaign has been hard to believe.\n\n\"Talking Points\" is amazed at how dishonest the American press reportage has been. Yes, there's been nasty stuff from both sides, no doubt. But with the mainstream media solidly behind Barack Obama, I think that's worth about five percentage points for him in the popular vote. I could be wrong.\n\nBut CNN was definitely wrong in what they did to Sarah Palin. It's outrageous.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nAs you may have heard, I signed up for another contract cycle here at FOX News. My boss, Roger Ailes, is a patriot for allowing me to continue. At least to me he is.\n\nNow I gave two interviews Tuesday on the subject: one to Richard Huff at the New York Daily News and the other to our pal Howard Kurtz at The Washington Post.\n\nNow, I'm like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football with Lucy holding it. I'm never going to learn.\n\nHuff did a fair story, but he listed my salary, which he got drastically wrong. But it doesn't matter. All the Web sites picked it up and, once again, falsehood becomes fact.\n\nKurtz wrote mostly about some negative aspects of \"The Factor,\" which is what The Post likes to do. Howard didn't do anything unprofessional. He simply gave his bosses what they want: negative stuff.\n\nFor example, Kurtz wrote that \"The Radio Factor\" is less successful than the TV \"Factor.\" Well, most media, Howard, is less successful than the TV \"Factor,\" including The Washington Post and CNN, where you work.\n\nThe fact is, \"The Radio Factor\" is one of the most profitable radio franchises in the history of the medium, but Howard wanted to find a negative, and he did. By the way, as I said, Howard also works for CNN.\n\nI'm not calling Mr. Huff and Mr. Kurtz pinheads. They don't deserve that designation off what they wrote, but both men could have done a little bit better on this one.\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads & Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

        "Text": "  (Updates with more opinion polls)      By Jeff Mason      ALBUQUERQUE, Sept 8 (Reuters) - John McCain's backers are  reveling in the crowds his White House campaign has drawn in  the 10 days since he made Alaska's little-known governor, Sarah  Palin, his running mate.      'Governor, you're a breath of fresh air,' Ken Starrs, a    police lieutenant from Corpus Christi, Texas, told Palin, 44,  at a Detroit ceremony where the political pair picked up an  endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police union.      'She's very real,' he said after they shook hands.      Critics have questioned the 72-year-old Republican  senator's judgment in choosing a vice presidential candidate  without high-profile experience. Palin has been governor since  2006. Her previous public service was as a small-town mayor.      Democrat Barack Obama, 47, has raised far more cash in the  race for the Nov. 4 election. He has sought to paint McCain as  heir to Republican President George W. Bush's unpopular  policies. But McCain and Palin are holding their own.      Five public opinion polls released on Monday showed McCain  and Obama essentially dead even as they headed into the final  eight weeks of the race for the White House.      McCain has decided to keep Palin with him on the trail a  few more days before sending her out to campaign on her own.      'I saw a new McCain today, and I'm very excited,' said  Bonnie Norris, 63, after a lively performance by the Arizona  senator in Albuquerque. 'He's opened up more. He's more  dynamic.'      Some 15,000 people turned out to see McCain name his vice  presidential pick in Dayton, Ohio, on Aug. 29. To soaring music  and high drama, Palin entered the stage with her family like a  new, if somewhat baffled, rock star.           'SARAH, SARAH'      Not known for the inspiring oratory that is Obama's  trademark, McCain has since soaked up some of the energy  generated by Palin, who is greeted with shouts of 'Sarah,  Sarah' at most rallies.      'She's ignited America,' McCain declared in New Mexico on  Saturday night. 'The response to her has been overwhelming.'      At the Albuquerque rally, which packed more than 6,000  people into a tight hall, McCain's 'Straight Talk Express' bus  pulled up and dropped the candidates in front of the crowd  while Van Halen's song 'Right Now' blasted over loudspeakers.      The many signs ranged from 'Sarah, you had USA at hello' to  'Lipstick wearing pitbulls for McCain,' a reference to her quip  at the Republican convention suggesting lipstick was the only  thing to distinguish a pit bull from a 'hockey mom.'      Aides said their relationship was cementing quickly.      'They knew each other a little (before), obviously, but  they're getting to know each other well,' said Mark Salter,  McCain's closest aide and speechwriter.      'They're very excited about these rallies. They're talking  about them, they're looking at each other for marks. You know,  they're talking to each other about policy, about energy policy  and a couple other things. They're getting along very well.'      On the day McCain introduced Palin as his running mate, she  referred to him as 'senator' and to his wife Cindy as 'Mrs.  McCain.' Do they call each other by first names now? 'Yeah, I  believe so,' Salter said.      Palin, who precedes him now at rallies with a rousing  reference to McCain's service as a Vietnam prisoner of war,  added a new bit to her introduction on Friday in Michigan: 'I  am honored ",

        "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Sept 18 (Reuters Life!) - From Sarah Palin's  trademark Kazuo Kawasaki glasses, to gun-toting action figuresand a large pumpkin carved with her face, the newcomer in the  U.S. election campaign has sparked a rush of online novelties.      Other shoppers are rushing to copy the style of the  Republican party's vice-presidential candidate ahead of the   Nov. 4 vote.      Figures show online sales of items related to Palin, the  governor of Alaska and self-described 'hockey mom', have shot  up over fivefold, overtaking sales of the election's three male  contenders, and prompting a far wider range of merchandise.      Demand may be muted for a $125 pumpkin hand-carved with  Palin's face, but Palin wigs for $75 could be more appealing  while a hockey puck featuring her photo, the U.S. flag and  reading 'Hockey Moms for Sarah Palin' is proving popular at  $15.      A piece of uneaten toast titled 'Sarah Palin on my toast! A  sign? You be the judge,' was up for sale on the online auction  site eBay, with 24 bids and one unbelievable offer of $7,100.      Karen Bard, an eBay spokeswoman, said the number of Palin  related items has surged since Republican John McCain on Aug.  29 named Palin, 44, as his running mate.      'The day after McCain popped the big question to Palin, 105  Palin items were listed on eBay. With the momentum from the  Republican National Convention, Palin items took off peaking at  554 listing in one day,' Bard said.      She said over the past 30 days on eBay, over 4,000 Palin  items have sold for an average of $5.61, with the highest item,  an autographed photo of mother-of-five Palin, getting $499.99.      A quick check found 1,500 items related to Palin for sale  on eBay, outnumbering 298 for Democratic vice-presidential  candidate Joe Biden, while Democrat Barack Obama had 4,500  items to his name and McCain 1,750.           FROM WEIRD TO WIGS      Obama and McCain can boast a vast array of books, posters,  T-shirts and badges but Bard said Palin supporters were  exercising their creative rights and freedom of speech by  listing thousands of different items, mainly to show support.      These included Sarah Palin Barbie dolls and action figures,  Palin beer Steins, T-shirts galore, and Palin thong underwear.      CafePress, an online store for independent retailers and  political merchandise, was running a graph showing sales for  Palin goods had overtaken items related to the others.      In the week ending Sept 13, her first week on the CafePress  chart, Palin items accounted for 32 percent of weekly sales,  topping McCain at 29 percent, Obama at 28 percent and Biden at  5 percent.      But it is not just the bizarre that is in demand. Followers  of fashion want the former beauty queen's looks.      Italee Optics, the U.S. distributor of Palin's rimless  frames by Japanese designer Kazuo Kawasaki, has reportedly run  out of supplies after orders soared and has increased imports.      Shoe company Naughty Monkey has seen a similar rush for the  open-toed red shoes that Palin wore on the day she was  introduced as McCain's running mate -- and wig sellers are out  in force.      'Hair stylists across the country are being barraged by  clientele for the 'Palin Up-do' (with) women putting politics  aside to admire an elegant hairstyle,' said a spokeswoman for  Paula Young, a Massachusetts retailer of hairpieces and wigs.

        "Text": "    By Steve Holland      WASHINGTON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Love her or hate her, Sarah  Palin was a phenomenon as the Republican vice presidential  running mate to John McCain, and the question for the  self-styled moose-hunting hockey mom is: What now?      Alaska Gov. Palin, plucked from obscurity and thrust on to  the national stage to mixed reviews, was publicly cool to talk  that she might have caught the presidential bug and seek to run  against Democrat Barack Obama in 2012.      'I don't know politically where in the world I'll be then,'  she told reporters on Wednesday in Phoenix.      But her interest in playing some kind of national role was  evident from the words of McCain himself on Tuesday night in  his concession speech after he was defeated by Obama.      'We can all look forward with great interest to her future  service to Alaska, the Republican Party and our country,' he  said.      Palin, 44, drew huge crowds on the campaign trail, bigger  than McCain's. She proved to be a powerful performer in stump  speeches, energizing the Republican base.      But she was less effective in television interviews,  botching a couple of early media encounters to the point that  some prominent conservatives said she was too inexperienced to  be a heartbeat away from the presidency.      Her folksy, 'you betcha' style was both refreshing and  grist for countless jokes on late-night television, giving a  career boost to her actress doppelganger, Tina Fey of NBC's  'Saturday Night Live.'      'She clearly has a future in national politics,' said  Republican strategist Scott Reed. 'She has to work to rebuild  the parts of her image that became a caricature. But she's  extremely popular with the grassroots.'      'Palin needs to take some time back in Alaska and regroup  with her day job. There's plenty of time to plot and scheme  after the Christmas holidays,' he said.           REPUBLICAN VISIONS      While Palin was selected by McCain in 2008, if she ran in  2012 she would compete against formidable members of her own  party with their own visions like former Massachusetts Gov.  Mitt Romney, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Louisiana  Gov. Bobby Jindal.      Republican strategist Tony Fabrizio said Palin is not the  frontrunner for the Republican nomination in 2012. He noted in  particular some revelations uncovered by the news media during  what amounted to a public vetting of her record once she was  picked by McCain.      Her acceptance of thousands of dollars in daily travel  expenses from the state while living at home and the Republican  Party's costly shopping spree to equip her and her family with  designer clothing may come back to haunt her.      'She needs to go back home and face all of the stuff that's  been raked up in the presidential race. Voters in Alaska found  out a lot of stuff about Sarah Palin that they didn't know  about Sarah Palin. She's got to go back and get herself  re-elected,' Fabrizio said.      Palin's future may depend on how the Republican Party  itself changes in response to its defeat.      Social conservatives who are warmest to Palin represent a  dwindling minority in the party, which was rocked by the Obama  victory and will now undergo a period of reflection and  soul-searching about the future.      Palin was said to have little time for people who did not  agree with her socially conservative views.      'If she wants to be a voice for a part of the new failed  Republican Party, she's going",

        "Text": "    By Sue Zeidler      LOS ANGELES, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Sarah Palin represents  many things Hollywood liberals love to hate, from her  opposition to gay marriage to her support for gun rights, yet  she possesses two key qualities they admire -- star appeal and  a great script.      Accordingly, Hollywood Republicans -- often overshadowed by  their left-leaning peers -- are seeking to capitalize on the  celebrity of John McCain's running mate in the Nov. 4 election  to generate support in a town well-known for its lavish  Democratic fund-raisers and events.      'She's certainly got star appeal and is the kind of  candidate that is made for Hollywood. I offered to throw her a  fundraiser myself,' said MGM chief Harry Sloan, one of  Hollywood's most vocal Republicans.      Palin has shaken up the White House race, boosted  enthusiasm among previously apathetic supporters of McCain's  presidential nomination and drawn support from women, rural  voters and Southerners, according to recent polls.      Sloan said there were no plans for a Palin Hollywood  fundraiser yet as her campaign managers were inundated with  similar requests from all over the country after her national  debut at the Republican National Convention on Sept. 3.      A campaign spokesman would not disclose McCain and Palin's  movements beyond one week's time, but various Hollywood  executives said they heard the Arizona senator and Alaska  governor would be swinging through California later this month  or early next month.      Democratic candidates have long enjoyed a fundraising  advantage in Hollywood. Through the end of July, Democratic  presidential nominee Barack Obama raised $5.2 million from the  entertainment industry, compared with McCain's $885,000,  according to the Center for Responsive Politics.      'It's like 10 to 1 here in terms of performing artists who  support Obama versus McCain. There are a significant group of  Republican supporters in Hollywood, but they're just not as  outspoken,' said political analyst Allan Hoffenblum.        PERSONAL STORY      Hollywood is aligning again for Obama on Sept. 16 when  Barbra Streisand will sing at a Beverly Hills event expected to  raise as much as $9 million.      While some Hollywood political watchers see Palin helping  to mobilize greater celebrity support around Obama, they said  filmmakers, producers and other entertainment executives were  fascinated by the personal story of McCain's running mate,  including her 'hockey mom' persona and passion for hunting.      'These people are interested in drama, and Sarah Palin, a  pistol-packing mother of five, is clearly an interesting  character. Politically, they may not agree with Sarah Palin but  they are intrigued,' said Joel Fox, a political analyst.      Long-time Democrat Dan Glickman, chairman of the Motion  Picture Association of America, attended the Republican  National Convention. 'It's important to show our organization  has allies in both camps. Our issues are bi-partisan,' said  Glickman.      'The question is does she become a bigger draw than McCain?  It's too early to draw any conclusions,' he said.      Palin's arrival is encouraging to Hollywood conservatives  like Robert Davi, who stars in director David Zucker's upcoming  'An American Carol,' a spoof about a liberal filmmaker who  wanted to abolish the July 4 Independence Day holiday.      'A lot of times, conservative guys on the set feel  intimidated and unable to speak their view,' said Da",

        "Text": "    Oct 2 (Reuters) - Republican vice presidential candidate  Sarah Palin debates her Democratic rival, Joe Biden, on  Thursday in their only face-off before the Nov. 4 presidential  election.      Following are some biographical details for Palin, a  little-known Alaska governor before she was chosen as John  McCain's running mate:           Age: 44      Birth date: Feb. 11, 1964      Birthplace: Sandpoint, Idaho      Education: University of Idaho      Husband: Todd Palin      Children: Two sons and three daughters      Religious affiliation: Has attended nondenominational  Wasilla Bible Church in recent years; previously attended  Wasilla Assembly of God, a Pentecostal church           Family: Palin moved to Alaska with her parents, a teacher  and school secretary, when she was an infant. She grew up in  Wasilla, a town of nearly 10,000 near Anchorage.      Palin was a member of the state champion girls basketball  team, where she earned the nickname 'Sarah Barracuda' for her  aggressive play. She was crowned Miss Wasilla in a 1982 beauty  pageant and later competed in the Miss Alaska contest.      Palin graduated in 1987 from the University of Idaho with a  degree in journalism and political science and eloped with her  high school boyfriend in 1988 to avoid the cost of a wedding.      The couple have five children -- two sons and three  daughters. The eldest son, Track, deployed to Iraq with the  U.S. Army in September. The youngest, son Trig, was born in  April with Down syndrome.           Career: After her graduation and marriage, Palin worked as  a television sports reporter from 1987 to 1989. She also worked  in the family's commercial fishing business and was the owner  of a snowmobile, watercraft and all-terrain vehicle business.           Elective office/public service: Palin was elected to the  Wasilla City Council in 1992. She served two terms on the  council and was elected mayor for two terms. She gained the  attention of Republican Party officials by promoting growth and  cutting property taxes.      Palin ran for lieutenant governor in 2002 but lost. After  actively campaigning for the Republican ticket under Frank  Murkowski, she was appointed to the panel that regulates the  state's oil and gas industry.      Palin established herself as a party outsider by promoting  a pipeline project opposed by Murkowski. She ran against the  governor in 2006, defeated him in the primary and then defeated  a former Democratic governor in the general election.      As governor she has worked on ethics reform, sought to  reduce state spending and promoted a deal that would offer $500  million in seed money for the construction of a natural gas  pipeline.      She ignited a controversy by firing the state's respected  top police officer. He charged he was dismissed for resisting  pressure from the governor's office to lay off a state trooper  who was involved in a bitter divorce and custody dispute with  Palin's sister. The state Legislature is investigating the  incident.

She ran against the  governor in 2006, defeated him in the primary and then defeated  a former Democratic governor in the general election.      As governor, she has worked on ethics reform, sought to  reduce state spending and promoted a deal that would offer $500  million in seed money for constructing a natural gas pipeline.      She ignited controversy by firing the state's respected top  police officer. He charged he was dismissed for resisting  pressure from Palin's office to lay off a state trooper  involved in a bitter divorce and custody dispute with her  sister. A state legislative inquiry concluded in October that  Palin had abused her power by pressuring subordinates to fire  the trooper. The Alaska Personnel Board on Monday cleared her  of wrongdoing in the matter.

        "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin  suggested in an interview broadcast on Monday that she might  run for higher office in 2012 if the right opportunity presents  itself.      Even before the Republican loss in last Tuesday's election  in which Palin was the running mate of Republican presidential  candidate John McCain, there was talk of the 44-year-old  first-term Alaska governor running for president in 2012.      'Show me where the open door is. Even if it's cracked up a  little bit, maybe I'll plow right on through that and maybe  prematurely plow through it, but don't let me miss an open  door,' Palin said in an interview on Fox News' 'On The Record'  program. She did not specify which office she might be  interested in seeking.      Palin, whose term as governor ends in two years,  said she  could not predict the future. But she said it would be 'very  exciting' to have an opportunity to serve in a greater  capacity.      'If there is an open door in '12 or four years later, and  if it is something that is going to be good for my family, for  my state, for my nation, an opportunity for me, then I'll plow  through that door,' Palin said.      As McCain's surprise pick in a hard-fought campaign against  Democrat Barack Obama, Palin attracted controversy but also a  strong following in the Republican Party's conservative base.

        "Text": "    By Jill Serjeant      LOS ANGELES, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Sarah Palin steps into the  lion's den of political satire on Saturday with an appearance on  the comedy show that has mocked the Republican vice-presidential  candidate and helped shape the national debate.      Palin's appearance on 'Saturday Night Live' follows a series  of dead-on impersonations of her by comedian Tina Fey that have  sent ratings for the show soaring and become as talked about as  the Alaska governor and self-described hockey mom herself.      Actor Josh Brolin, who captures the Texas swagger and twang  of President George W. Bush in the new Oliver Stone biopic  'W.', is expected to join Palin on Saturday's show, just 17 days  before the Nov. 4 election.      'I just want to be there to show Americans that we will  rise above the political shots that we take because we're in  this serious business for serious challenges that are facing  the good American people right now,' Palin told Neal Boortz,  talking about the forthcoming SNL appearance on his syndicated  radio show on Friday.      It was not clear whether Fey, the Emmy-award winning star  of the TV show '30 Rock' and the movie 'Baby Mama', will  reprise her own turn as Palin. Fey's three skits have boosted  'Saturday Night Live' ratings by 50 percent in the past month  and attracted more than 38 million viewings live or online.      Fey's impersonations have included an 'I can see Russia from  my house' joke skewering what critics see as Palin's lack of  foreign policy knowledge, and a flute-toting bid for a 'talent  portion' during the vice presidential debate that played on  critics' charges that Palin, a one-time beauty pageant contestant,  is too shallow for the vice presidency.      The skits have capped a political season in which comedy has  played an influential role.      Palin was a surprise pick by Republican presidential candidate  John McCain in August as his running mate, and has been a big hit  with conservative Christians who admire her no-nonsense, folksy  style. But the choice has been derided by supporters of Democratic  candidate Barack Obama, thanks in part to the Fey skits.      'I would expect that the McCain campaign would be much happier  if Tina Fey wasn't so popular with her impersonation of Sarah  Palin,' Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at the  University of Southern California, told Reuters.      'It does shape the public perception of Sarah Palin,' Jeffe  said.      Democrats Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden have also been  lampooned on SNL, and both Obama and McCain have appeared on the  show during the long presidential campaign.           GOING WHERE OTHERS DON'T TREAD      Satirical news shows like 'The Colbert Report' and Jon  Stewart's 'The Daily Show' along with jokes by late night chat  show hosts David Letterman and Jay Leno have gone where  straight news reporting has often feared to tread, according to  Robert Thompson, professor of media and popular culture at  Syracuse University.      'We are in a period now that journalists are afraid of  being accused of picking on people. Comedy is not only  influential but lately it has become an important part of the  U.S. civic conversation,' Thompson said.      'What Jon Stewart and Tina Fey are doing is not only  hysterically funny, but they really have used comedy to make us  ask questions about the things we should be thinking about.'      Thompson said Fey's skit of Palin's rambling television  intervi",

        "Text": "    Aug 29, (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John  McCain has chosen Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice  presidential running mate, a campaign official said on Friday.      The choice of the 44-year-old mother of five adds youth and  executive experience to the Republican ticket headed by the  72-year-old Arizona senator, who would be the oldest person to  assume the presidency if he is elected Nov. 4.      The choice of Palin adds a woman and a strong pro-life  voice to the Republican campaign, but her youth, limited  governmental experience and lack of exposure nationally could  be weaknesses for the ticket.      Following are some facts and figures about Palin:      * Palin was sworn in as Alaska's youngest and first woman  governor in December 2006. Born in Sandpoint, Idaho, Feb. 11,  1964, she moved to Alaska with her parents as an infant.      * Palin is a darling of U.S. conservatives because of  record on tax cuts, opposition to abortion and other issues.  Her place on the ticket may help shore up McCain with the  Republican Party's Christian base.      * Before her election as governor two years ago, she served  on the Wasilla City Council and as mayor of the town. She was  later appointed to the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation  Commission, where she learned about the state's energy  industry.      * Like McCain she has a maverick streak. She has taken on  big oil companies in Alaska and has broken ranks with the local  Republican establishment.      * 'The oil companies have been hugely influential in  Alaska, certainly over the last decade and a half with the  prior two administrations ... (For) Alaskans, as owners of the  resource ... it is time to embrace our sovereignty,' she told  Reuters in an interview a few months ago.      * Palin is a devout Christian who is opposed to abortion  rights. She is also an avid hunter and angler and a member of  the National Rifle Association, a powerful conservative lobby  that is staunchly opposed to gun control.      * She has irked environmentalists by opposing the listing  of the polar bear as a threatened species and is a big  supporter of oil and gas drilling off the Alaska coast.      * Palin, who grew up in Wasilla, near Anchorage, studied  journalism and political science at the University of Idaho.  She worked in a commercial fishing business with her husband  and as a television sportscaster before entering politics.      * Palin gave birth to her fifth child, a son, in April,  becoming the second U.S. governor to have a baby while serving  in office.

I'm not doing this for naught,' Palin told ABC News in a  taped interview airing on Thursday.      With less than a week before Election Day, Palin said she  believes in the current Republican presidential ticket and that  she thinks 'it's going to go our way on Tuesday, Nov. 4.'      'I truly believe that the wisdom of the people will be  revealed on that day,' she said.      Palin has energized the Republican base of supporters. But  the Alaska governor has come under withering criticism on a  variety of issues, including whether she is qualified to become  vice president.

        "Text": "    By Richard Valdmanis      TORONTO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. vice presidential hopeful  Sarah Palin fell prey to a Canadian prankster on Saturday when  he called her impersonating French President Nicolas Sarkozy  and got her to accept an invitation to hunt baby seals.      In an over-the-top French accent, a member of the Quebec  comedy duo 'The Masked Avengers,' famous for tricking  celebrities and politicians including Sarkozy himself, asked if  Palin would take him on a hunting trip by helicopter, and then  in French said they could also go kill baby seals.      An apparently oblivious Palin said she thought that would  be fun. 'We could have a lot of fun together as we're getting  work done. We could kill two birds with one stone that way.'      The prankster also got Palin, Republican John McCain's  running mate in Tuesday's U.S. presidential election, to reveal  a potential ambition for the top job in Washington.      Asked if she would like to eventually become president, the  Alaska governor responded, 'Well, maybe in eight years.'      Palin's office quickly admitted they were hoodwinked.      'Governor Palin was mildly amused to learn that she had  joined the ranks of heads of state, including President  Sarkozy, and other celebrities in being targeted by these  pranksters. C'est la vie,' Palin spokeswoman Tracy Schmitt said  in an e-mail.      During the phone call, which was played for a Montreal  radio program, Palin complimented the fake Sarkozy on his  beautiful wife, Carla Bruni, and asked him to give her a 'big  hug' for her.      'You added a lot of energy to your country with that  beautiful family of yours,' Palin said.      The prankster responded by complimenting Palin on a  notorious Hustler porn film 'Nailin' Paylin,' which he said was  a documentary of her life.      'Oh good, thank you,' Palin said.      Palin also reassured the fake Sarkozy when he said he would  not want to bring Vice President Dick Cheney on a hunting trip.  Cheney once accidentally shot a hunting partner.      'I'll be a careful shot,' she promised.

        "Text": "    * 'America's excited' about Palin, McCain says      * Fiorina: Obama sexist for questioning Palin experience      * Convention resumes normal business after hurricane break      * Bush, to speak via satellite, cites McCain's experience           By Steve Holland      ST. PAUL, Sept 2 (Reuters) - John McCain and his fellow  Republicans rallied behind his vice presidential pick, Sarah  Palin, on Tuesday and his campaign accused Democrat Barack  Obama of sexism for questioning her level of experience.      The support came as the Republican convention to nominate  McCain and Palin as the party's candidates was finally getting  started, after a delay due to Hurricane Gustav, with President  George W. Bush to speak via satellite hookup.      Palin's disclosure that her unmarried 17-year-old daughter  is pregnant and the news that she had hired a private lawyer in  an ethics probe in Alaska have triggered a media firestorm and  led some to question McCain's judgment and how thoroughly the  relatively unknown governor's background was examined before  she was selected last week.      In excerpts of his remarks, Bush cited McCain's national  security experience as justification for electing him on Nov. 4  over Democrat Barack Obama.      And he backed Palin on a day Palin was behind closed doors  in St. Paul preparing for an address she will give to the  convention on Wednesday.      The McCain camp issued a photo of Palin meeting Bush's  wife, Laura, and McCain's wife, Cindy.      'When the debates have ended, and all the ads have run, and  it is time to vote, Americans will look closely at the  judgment, the experience, and the policies of the candidates --  and they will cast their ballots for the McCain-Palin ticket,'  Bush said.      McCain predicted a warm welcome for Palin when she  addressed the convention. 'America's excited and they're going  to be even more excited once they see her tomorrow night,'  McCain told reporters in Cleveland. 'I'm very, very proud of  the impression that she's made on all of America and I'm  looking forward to serving with her.'      In Philadelphia, he defended his search. 'My vetting  process was completely thorough and I'm grateful for the  results,' McCain said.              SEXISM?      McCain's campaign fought back hard after Obama told CNN on  Monday that Palin's level of experience as a former mayor of  tiny Wasilla, Alaska, did not match his own, citing the size of  his campaign.      'My understanding is that Gov. Palin's town, Wasilla, has I  think 50 employees. We've got 2,500 in this campaign. I think  their budget is maybe $12 million dollars a year -- we have a  budget of about three times that just for the month,' Obama had  said.      McCain adviser Carly Fiorina accused him of sexism, a  charge the Obama camp faced during Democrat Hillary Clinton's  primary battle against him.      'The facts are that Sarah Palin has made more executive  decisions as a mayor and governor than Barack Obama has made in  his life,' Fiorina said.      'Because of Hillary Clinton's historic run for the  presidency and the treatment she received, American women are  more highly tuned than ever to recognize and decry sexism in  all its forms. They will not tolerate sexist treatment of Gov.  Palin,' Fiorina said.      The McCain campaign released a copy of Palin's Republican  voter registration card to rebut a report in The New York Times  that Palin was a member of the Alaskan Independence Party for  two year",

        "Text": "    A Reuters team of reporters and editors will provide full  coverage of the Republican Party convention in St. Paul this week  as the campaign for the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 4  intensifies.           Sarah Palin takes the spotlight with a prime-time speech on  Wednesday that will introduce her to American voters, as  Republican John McCain's running mate joins him in his fight with  Democrat Barack Obama for the White House.      On Tuesday, President Bush saluted McCain as the man to  replace him in a brief speech by satellite to a convention  featuring assaults on Obama and a strong defense of Palin.     The Obama campaign fired back by saying: 'The man George Bush  needs may be John McCain, but the change America needs is Barack  Obama.'
