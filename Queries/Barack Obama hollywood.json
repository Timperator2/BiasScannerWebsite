        "Text": "    By Alex Dobuzinskis      LOS ANGELES, June 19 (Reuters) - Ahead of a big fundraising  event next week, many Hollywood power players are rallying  behind Barack Obama in his bid for U.S. president, pledging  money and starpower after lending early support to his one-time  rival Hillary Clinton.      Experts say that since Clinton conceded defeat earlier this  month in her bid to be the Democratic candidate, celebrities  have quickly united behind Obama.      The result, they said, could be a campaign cash windfall  for the senator from Illinois, but star support doesn't  necessarily transfer directly to votes.      A Tuesday fundraiser in downtown Los Angeles is expected to  attract a host of Hollywood stars and feature a performance by  the singer Seal at a cost of $2,300 per ticket.      Director Steven Spielberg and his partner in the Dreamworks  movie studio, David Geffen, and Dreamworks Animation Chief  Executive Officer Jeffrey Katzenberg are organizing another  Obama fundraiser for later this year, said Andy Spahn, a  consultant to the Hollywood power-trio.      'If a Hollywood celebrity puts his or her mind to it,  they're good money raisers,' said analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe,  a senior scholar at the University of Southern California.      'Barbra Streisand, you put her in concert and you raise  fortunes for Democrats, or Bruce Springsteen,' Jeffe said.      Mitchell Schwartz, who was Obama's California campaign  manager through the primary election season, said Obama's  appeal in Hollywood had been limited, until now.      'I don't think we were the Hollywood candidate -- ever,'  Schwartz said. 'I think Hillary might have been more, she might  have had more support.'           ALIGNING THE STARS      Other Obama celebrity endorsers include talk show host  Oprah Winfrey and actors Robert De Niro, Tom Hanks, Scarlett  Johansson and Halle Berry.      Billionaire Geffen upset many Hollywood power players and  political supporters last year when the longtime Clinton  supporter broke for Obama.      Oscar winner Hanks, the star of 'The Da Vinci Code,' gave  money to Bill Clinton's legal defense fund when he was  president, but endorsed Obama with an online video in early  May, when Hillary Clinton was still campaigning.      In the video, Hanks joked that celebrity endorsements do  little to sway voters, and Jeffe said that while stars can help  raise cash, agreed that their appeal may also do harm if voters  consider celebrities too liberal.      During the primaries, Obama had trouble attracting Hispanic  voters in some states because, analysts said, some Hispanics  were reluctant to vote for a black candidate.      But a pro-Obama video in Spanish with Hispanic actors  Jessica Alba of 'The Love Guru,' John Leguizamo of 'The  Happening' and comedian George Lopez, has attracted more than  250,000 viewers on the video sharing site YouTube.com.      'It helps build a broader sense of a candidate's support,'  said professor Chon Noriega, director of the University of  California, Los Angeles, Chicano Studies Research Center. 'But  I don't think that because George Lopez said support (a  candidate) somebody's going to say, 'Well that's who I'm going  to vote for.''      Presumptive Republican candidate Sen. John McCain also has  his celebrity endorsers, including actors Robert Duvall and  Sylvester Stallone.

        "Text": " (Updates with details, quotes, paragraphs 3-7)      By Alex Dobuzinskis      LOS ANGELES, June 19 (Reuters) - Many Hollywood celebrities  who had supported Hillary Clinton are rallying behind Barack  Obama, pledging money and star power to the Democrat's U.S.  presidential bid before a big fundraiser next week.      Experts say that since Clinton conceded defeat this month  after a grueling Democratic nominating contest, celebrities  have quickly united behind Obama.      The result, they said, could be a campaign cash windfall  for the senator from Illinois, but star support doesn't  necessarily translate directly to votes.      Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior scholar at the University of  Southern California, said that once a politician becomes known,  voters look for candidates with positions they like and with  whom they can identify, regardless of celebrity backing.      In fact, stars can cause harm if a performer's public image  rubs voters the wrong way. That happened when Jane Fonda and  Barbra Streisand campaigned for former Texas Gov. Ann Richards  in her conservative state, and Richards lost the bid.      'Sometimes they can come back to bite the candidate,' Jeffe  said.      But Los Angeles is a town where stars wield a great deal of  power and have money to spend, and numerous celebrities are  expected to turn out at a Tuesday fundraiser featuring the  singer Seal -- at a cost of $2,300 per ticket.

        "Text": "A year after electing Barack Obama president, and five years after his star turn at the Democratic National Convention, we are still trying to figure him out.\n\nIs he a left-wing radical or is he a crowd-pleasing moderate? Is he a uniter? Is he actually religious? Is he a socialist? Does he hate America? And, in light of the confidence he projects, why can\u2019t he seem to take criticism?\n\nBut we could, of course, write that first sentence another way: Only a year after electing Barack Obama president, and we are already trying to figure him out.\n\nRather than it being kind of late to attempt a rigorous analysis of President Obama\u2019s psyche, his political philosophy and his managerial style, perhaps it\u2019s a little too soon. Presidential personalities, after all, develop over time. And the famous saying is true that great leaders aren\u2019t born, but made.\n\nNonetheless, because I\u2019m too young for caution, and too old for fear, I\u2019m more than happy to take a stab at it.\n\nLet me first assuage the fears of many of my conservative friends and colleagues: Barack Obama is not a left-wing radical. He is not a socialist, a communist or a Marxist, and he\u2019s not a black liberation theologist. He\u2019s not un-American, he\u2019s not an atheist, and he\u2019s not a racist.\n\nHe is none of those things, because all would require Barack Obama to have a belief system, a worldview, a set of convictions about political philosophy, theology, and socioeconomics that he simply doesn\u2019t have. He is, instead, empty. He is an empty vessel.\n\nThis will shock and offend his legion of admirers on the left, as it stands in stark contrast to the breathless, leg-thrilling declarations by liberal America that Obama is a deep-thinking, complex, contemplative scholar of soaring intellect, a new kind of leader, exquisitely built for a changing world, who knows the war isn\u2019t between good and evil, but between silence and diplomacy, and for whom indecision is a mark of judicious caution.\n\nBut he\u2019d done nothing to deserve those early accolades, of course. So all of that was pre-ordained and pre-packaged, the result of a coordinated and deliberate campaign by a coalition of marketers, politicos, and members of the press to brand Barack Obama as \u201chope and change\u201d before anyone even knew what his selling points were, or if he actually had any.\n\nThe proof of his ideological emptiness is practically undeniable. He has been, over the short course of his political career, the great abandoner, ever-willing to denounce those ideals that were previously sold to his constituents as \u201chis convictions.\u201d\n\nAfter 20 years in Reverend Wright\u2019s church, he simply got up and left. The man who baptized his children, who was marketed (to black voters in particular) as Obama\u2019s spiritual adviser, who was so integral in shaping Barack Obama\u2019s adult life, that he publicly denounced him, and left his church altogether. And he also denounced black liberation theology, despite giving numerous interviews about the ways in which it had helped shape his religious worldview. After initially defending Rev. Wright, suddenly he and his brand of religion were chucked out the window of a moving campaign bus. He has yet to find a replacement, unsurprisingly, but his interest in evangelicals like Rick Warren and Carey Cash means he is open to the theological polar opposite of Rev. Wright.\n\nThe same sort of dance occurred with other politically inconvenient allies, like domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, Wright apologist Father Michael Pfleger, and convicted felon Tony Rezko. Obama distanced himself from all of them and then eventually dumped them altogether when it became politically necessary. Van Jones was merely a post-election victim of Obama\u2019s willing abandonment. And there have been others.\n\nSo would a real radical disown his radical mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s? Would a real extremist and true-believer insist with a straight face that he didn\u2019t really believe all that stuff? Would a real ideologue be persuaded by a public opinion poll to abandon whole ideology?\n\nActual radicals like Wright and Ayers and Jones defend their beliefs, regardless of the pushback and potential fallout. What Obama did, in contrast, was purely political. Because, despite the insistence by the left that Obama somehow transcends politics, that\u2019s what he is \u2013 a politician. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nWe can also look at the shift in his policy positions over the past few years. He was once quoted as saying that he supported a single-payer health care system. The best political decision now, however, was to abandon that for a more docile public option. Once that failed to garner the groundswell of support his advisers thought it would, he appeared altogether indifferent to it. If he were reallya radical, he\u2019d be rallying us around universal health care right now, not some watered-down 1990-page bureaucratic hodge podge that is neither revolutionary nor practical.\n\nHis impassioned pledges to end \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d close Gitmo, bring troops home, end military tribunals, and myriad other promises, suddenly seem less like the stuff of real political conviction, and more like political headaches that require a clever exit strategy.\n\nAnd his reaction to any kind of opposition \u2013 from the right, from the citizenry, from Fox News \u2013 is equally telling. If Obama\u2019s agenda were based on conviction instead of political expedience and an unquenchable thirst for popularity, criticism would bounce right off him. Instead he seems frighteningly flappable. That\u2019s because leadership without convictions is leadership of empty rhetoric. Convictions can be defended against criticism. Empty rhetoric cannot.\n\nSo why all the radical friends and the radical proposals and the radical rhetoric if he\u2019s not himself a radical? Because his lack of conviction and his inability to forge his own philosophical and theological identity, have made him incredibly susceptible to external influence and pressure. He is easily led. He is, as such, the perfect prospect for someone like Bill Ayers or Reverend Wright, whose radical agendas require vulnerable recruits who are malleable and willing.\n\nI don\u2019t know if President Obama is a man of conviction, if he is a man of faith, or if he is the intellectual giant the left really wants him to be. He very well may be all of those things. But I haven\u2019t seen proof of any of it yet, and neither have you, because there hasn\u2019t been any.\n\nThe only thing we do know for sure, one year after anointing this relative unknown the forty-fourth president of the United States, is that he\u2019s a politician, pure and simple. Calling him a radical gives him way too much credit.\n\nS.E. Cupp is a write and co-author of \"Why You're Wrong About the Right.\" She is a frequent contributor to the Fox Forum.",

        "Text": "    Jan 20 (Reuters) - Barack Obama will be sworn in as the  44th president of the United States at noon on Tuesday.      Here are some biographical facts about the first  African-American to hold the nation's highest office.        Age: 47      Birthdate: Aug. 4, 1961      Birthplace: Honolulu, Hawaii      Education: Columbia University; Harvard Law School      Wife: Michelle Robinson Obama      Children: Daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7      Religious affiliation: United Church of Christ      Party: Democrat        Family: Barack Obama was born to a Kenyan father and a  white American mother. His father, Barack Obama Sr., married  his mother, Ann Dunham, while studying at the University of  Hawaii. The couple separated two years after Obama was born.  His father ultimately returned to Kenya, where he became a  noted economist. He died in a car accident in 1982.      Obama's mother's second marriage was to an Indonesian man  named Lolo Soetoro. The family moved to Indonesia and Obama  remained there until he was 10 when he moved back to Hawaii and  lived with his grandparents while studying on a scholarship at  the elite Punahou Academy.      He has seven half brothers and sisters in Kenya from his  father's other marriages, and a half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng,  from his mother's second marriage.        Career: After finishing college in 1983, Obama worked for a  New York financial consultancy and a consumer organization. He  landed a job in Chicago in 1985 as an organizer for Developing  Communities Project, a church-based group seeking to improve  living conditions in poor neighborhoods.      Three years later, Obama left to go to Harvard Law School,  where he became the first black president of the law review. He  worked as a summer associate at the Sidley Austin law firm in  Chicago, where he met his future wife. After graduation from  Harvard in 1991, Obama practiced civil rights law at a small  firm in Chicago, then became a lecturer in constitutional law  at the University of Chicago in 1993.        Elective office: Obama won a seat in the Illinois state  Senate in 1996. During his time in the Legislature, he worked  on welfare and ethics legislation, as well as a measure  requiring electronic recording of police interrogations and  confessions in homicide investigations.      Obama won a heavily contested U.S. Senate seat in 2004,  carrying 53 percent of the Democratic primary vote in an  eight-candidate race. He easily won the general election as  well. In the U.S. Senate he compiled a liberal voting record,  but was one of the few Democrats to back a measure on  class-action lawsuits. He opposed the appointment of Chief  Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito to the U.S.  Supreme Court.      The nonpartisan National Journal ranked him as the most  liberal member of the U.S. Senate early this year based on his  voting record in 2007. He was ranked 10th most liberal in 2006  and 16th most liberal in 2005.           Presidential campaign: Obama announced his presidential  candidacy on Feb. 10, 2007. Though New York Sen. Hillary  Clinton was initially seen as the front-runner for the  Democratic nomination, Obama quickly showed an ability to raise  large amounts of money and draw record-breaking crowds who were  attracted to his rhetorical skill, his opposition to the Iraq  war, and his promise to move beyond the divisive politics of  the past 40 years.      Obama won the first contest of the Democratic primary in  Iowa in",

The nonpartisan National Journal ranked him as the most  liberal member of the Senate early this year based on his  voting record in 2007. He was ranked 10th most liberal in 2006  and 16th most liberal in 2005.

        "Text": "    By Sue Zeidler      LOS ANGELES, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Sarah Palin represents  many things Hollywood liberals love to hate, from her  opposition to gay marriage to her support for gun rights, yet  she possesses two key qualities they admire -- star appeal and  a great script.      Accordingly, Hollywood Republicans -- often overshadowed by  their left-leaning peers -- are seeking to capitalize on the  celebrity of John McCain's running mate in the Nov. 4 election  to generate support in a town well-known for its lavish  Democratic fund-raisers and events.      'She's certainly got star appeal and is the kind of  candidate that is made for Hollywood. I offered to throw her a  fundraiser myself,' said MGM chief Harry Sloan, one of  Hollywood's most vocal Republicans.      Palin has shaken up the White House race, boosted  enthusiasm among previously apathetic supporters of McCain's  presidential nomination and drawn support from women, rural  voters and Southerners, according to recent polls.      Sloan said there were no plans for a Palin Hollywood  fundraiser yet as her campaign managers were inundated with  similar requests from all over the country after her national  debut at the Republican National Convention on Sept. 3.      A campaign spokesman would not disclose McCain and Palin's  movements beyond one week's time, but various Hollywood  executives said they heard the Arizona senator and Alaska  governor would be swinging through California later this month  or early next month.      Democratic candidates have long enjoyed a fundraising  advantage in Hollywood. Through the end of July, Democratic  presidential nominee Barack Obama raised $5.2 million from the  entertainment industry, compared with McCain's $885,000,  according to the Center for Responsive Politics.      'It's like 10 to 1 here in terms of performing artists who  support Obama versus McCain. There are a significant group of  Republican supporters in Hollywood, but they're just not as  outspoken,' said political analyst Allan Hoffenblum.        PERSONAL STORY      Hollywood is aligning again for Obama on Sept. 16 when  Barbra Streisand will sing at a Beverly Hills event expected to  raise as much as $9 million.      While some Hollywood political watchers see Palin helping  to mobilize greater celebrity support around Obama, they said  filmmakers, producers and other entertainment executives were  fascinated by the personal story of McCain's running mate,  including her 'hockey mom' persona and passion for hunting.      'These people are interested in drama, and Sarah Palin, a  pistol-packing mother of five, is clearly an interesting  character. Politically, they may not agree with Sarah Palin but  they are intrigued,' said Joel Fox, a political analyst.      Long-time Democrat Dan Glickman, chairman of the Motion  Picture Association of America, attended the Republican  National Convention. 'It's important to show our organization  has allies in both camps. Our issues are bi-partisan,' said  Glickman.      'The question is does she become a bigger draw than McCain?  It's too early to draw any conclusions,' he said.      Palin's arrival is encouraging to Hollywood conservatives  like Robert Davi, who stars in director David Zucker's upcoming  'An American Carol,' a spoof about a liberal filmmaker who  wanted to abolish the July 4 Independence Day holiday.      'A lot of times, conservative guys on the set feel  intimidated and unable to speak their view,' said Da",

The plan would include an immediate $250 tax credit to workers  that could double if the economy worsens; a one-time $250  supplement to Social Security retirement payments, a $10 billion  fund to help homeowners facing foreclosure, and a $10 billion fund  to bolster states facing budget shortfalls.      The Illinois senator's office unveiled the proposals while  campaigning in Nevada, which holds the next contested Democratic  primary on Saturday. His leading rival, New York Sen. Hillary  Clinton, also recently unveiled an economic stimulus package.

The U.S. Democratic presidential candidate was ranked No.1  by readers on the AskMen.com lifestyle Web site, beating Apple  chief executive Steve Jobs and Olympic swimming champion  Michael Phelps, who landed in the No. 2 and No. 3 spots,  respectively.      Republican presidential candidate John McCain was ranked  No. 10 on the list, which was compiled on the basis of 200,000  votes from readers of the Web site whose average age is 27-28  years-old.      Last year's winner, British soccer star David Beckham, fell  to No. 25 on the 2008 list, which asked men to go beyond  professional success and likability when picking their top 49  choices.      James Bassil, editor-in-chief of AskMen.com, said he  thought Obama's top place was not so much a political  endorsement of his candidacy as 'a reflection of the interest  the presidential race has ignited in the United States.'

Here are five facts about the Illinois Senator who aims to  become the first black president of the United States:           *Obama's father was born and raised in a village in Kenya; his  mother, who was white, grew up in Kansas.           *Obama grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia. He earned his law  degree from Harvard in 1991 and was the first African-American  president of the Harvard Law Review.           *He is married to wife Michelle and has two young  daughters.           *He was a member of the Illinois State Senate before being  elected to the U.S. Senate. His speech at the Democratic  National Convention in 2004 earned him national attention and  acclaim.           *On issues key to many Democratic voters, Obama favors  withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq, reducing carbon emissions to  fight climate change, and eliminating tax breaks from companies  that move jobs overseas.

        "Text": "Tension is rising between India and Pakistan because it looks like the killers who attacked Mumbai were based inside Pakistani territory. If shooting breaks out between these two countries, the world will have yet another crisis created by Muslim terrorists.\n\nIt is obvious to sane people that the American intelligence agencies must continue to stay ahead of the terror-killers and disrupt plots like Mumbai should they be directed here. To do that, information from captured terror suspects becomes vital.\n\nBut President-elect Obama has committed himself to an undefined no torture policy and is also having some difficulty finding someone to head up the CIA. Former CIA Chief of Staff John Brennan has taken himself out of the running because some far-left loons criticized him for taking an aggressive anti-terror stance after 9/11.\n\nThis is very disturbing. The far-left wants the CIA to go by the Army Field Manual when interrogating suspects. If that happens, all of us will be in danger.\n\nWhy? Well, here's what the manual says: \"Prisoners of war who refuse to answer (questions) may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.\"\n\nNow \u2014 and this is important \u2014 that is fine for the military. It is not their job to break down terror suspects. It's their job to kill or capture them on the battlefield. The CIA should interrogate high-value targets.\n\nBut if Obama orders the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies not to employ any tough interrogation methods, trust me, many people will die. The terrorists are not going to stop, and only very aggressive action against them has kept us safe since 9/11.\n\nBut these far-left loons, these despicable people who blame America for worldwide terrorism, now have far more power in this country than they did just one month ago.\n\nI believe Barack Obama understands the danger the Muslim terrorists pose to the world. I believe Mr. Obama will not destroy the CIA's ability to break down terror suspects. He has to know that hardcore terrorists are not going to give up information easily.\n\nBut still some people don't get it, and these people are foolish and dangerous, so crazed by their far-left ideology they'd allow innocent people to die for it.\n\nThe USA should never torture, but coerced interrogation at the direction of the president is vital when lives are on the line. Of course, the loons will never acknowledge that. They don't want to do anything \"unpleasant\" to terror suspects.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nAs you may know, actor Patrick Swayze is waging a valiant fight against pancreatic cancer. The 56-year-old actor is working on a new TV show and generally fighting the good fight.\n\nBut a number of tabloids continue to sound the death knell for him, and Mr. Swayze would like them to knock it off. We hope they do, because the man is brave and a patriot.\n\nOn the pinhead front, you make the call on this one. At the opening of a new visitors' center at the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said this:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID, D-NEV.: My staff has always said, \"Don't say this,\" but I'm going to say it again, because it's so descriptive, because it's true.\n\nLeader Boehner mentioned that tourists lined up in the summer and winter, long lines coming into the Capitol. In the summertime, because of the high humidity and how hot it gets here, you could literally smell the tourists coming into the Capitol.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nNo matter how bad the folks smell, it doesn't compete with some of the stuff going on in the Senate.\n\nPinhead? You make the call.\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads & Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

        "Text": "    By Caren Bohan      EVANSVILLE, Ind., April 23 (Reuters) - Barack Obama's rapid  rise from relative obscurity toward winning the Democratic  Party nomination for U.S. president hit another bump when he  lost to rival Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania.      Obama's defeat on Tuesday in the state's nominating contest  slowed his momentum, but he still holds the lead in delegates  who will decide the party's nominee to run against Republican  John McCain in the November presidential election.      Just four years after he burst onto the national political  scene with a keynote speech at the Democratic Party convention,  the questions for those deciding whether to support Obama have  been mostly about his relative inexperience.      Is the 46-year-old first-term senator who would be the  first black U.S. president just a 'phenomenon' desired by a  war-weary nation eager for a fresh face or does he have what it  takes to be an effective president?      Obama cast his scant time on the national political scene  as an advantage, saying it meant his hope and ideals had not  been compromised. His rousing oratory and can-do message struck  a chord early with the public, drawing large crowds and  enthusing young voters.      Doubts over whether voters were 'ready' for a black  president diminished as he steadily chipped away at Clinton's  large early lead and eventually moved past her in the long  run-up to the presidential election.      Once the race was down to two Democratic candidates, there  was little to distinguish them on policy issues.           MULTICULTURAL AMERICA      Obama often points to his roots -- his father was Kenyan  and his mother a white woman from Kansas -- as one reason he  should be picked to run the country, saying he is   representative of multicultural America.      One of his favorite lines --- 'When you're a black guy  named Barack Obama and you're running for president you've got  to have hope' -- regularly draws laughs.      But it is clear Obama has also asked serious questions  about his heritage.      A two-time bestselling author who also won two Grammy  awards for the audio version of his books, Obama chronicled his  struggles to understand himself and his race in 1995 in 'Dreams  from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance.'      He followed up the memoir in 2006 with 'The Audacity of  Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream' outlining his  political principles.      While attracting wide support among African Americans,  Obama eschewed the rhetoric of race struggle and structured his  campaign to appeal to all races.      He has also described himself as a 'blank screen' on which  people of all different political leanings can project their  own views.        CLOSER SCRUTINY      As he moved ahead in the polls and the race for delegates  who pick the party nominee, Democratic and Republican opponents  took a closer look at his record and associates.      Video of Jeremiah Wright, his black pastor at the Trinity  United Church of Christ in Chicago, giving racially and  politically charged sermons, including saying U.S. policies  were partially responsible for Sept. 11 attacks, surfaced on  the Internet in March.      Obama, who borrowed the words 'audacity of hope' from  Wright, was forced to disavow his pastor and ended up giving a  much-praised speech on race in America.      Suddenly, every word and action was under a microscope.  Comments to a closed-door fund-raiser earlier this month sayi",

        "Text": "This is a rush transcript from \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" November 24, 2008. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nWatch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET and listen to the \"Radio Factor!\"\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM, GUEST HOST: In the \"Personal Story\" segment tonight: According to a report in the L.A. Times, some gay rights supporters in Hollywood may be starting a blacklist against people who supported traditional marriage by giving money to Prop 8 advocates.\n\nJoining us now from Los Angeles is Andrew Breitbart, publisher of Breitbart.com, and one of a handful of conservatives who are brave enough to speak out in Hollywood. Andrew, great to see you.\n\nClick here to watch the segment.\n\nANDREW BREITBART, BREITBART.COM: Hey, Laura. How are you?\n\nINGRAHAM: I remember when George Clooney was telling us that, you know, the biggest threat to mankind, you know, a few decades back was the blacklisting in Hollywood of people who dared to question authority. And so is this actually happening now on the other side of the political fence?\n\nBREITBART: Well, this is a more conspicuous form of blacklisting. It happens for conservatives every single day in Hollywood. This FEC search mechanism is a way that the left, the activist left, not specifically gay groups, because there are a lot of gay people who are against gay marriage. There are a lot of people who think that it should be up for debate.\n\nBut this is the same group of people back in the 1980s, Michelangelo Signorile, who started OutWeek magazine, who started to out people who were actually gay who didn't agree with the activist left agenda for the gay community. So what's happening right now is those schoolyard bullies are back, playing a bigger game on a bigger playground.\n\nINGRAHAM: Right.\n\nBREITBART: Yes.\n\nINGRAHAM: What are they actually doing? What's being done to people who have given to Prop 8? Because I know the San Francisco Chronicle is allowing people who go to their Web site to find out who gave to what Prop 8 groups.\n\nBREITBART: It's there. That's exactly what they are doing. Scott Eckern, who is the musical \u2014 the director of the California Musical Theater, had his name initially exposed, and he had to step down. To me that's an effective blacklist.\n\nEl Coyote restaurant in Los Angeles, the floor manager, not the owner but the floor manager, gave $100. And people started to protest El Coyote restaurant. So it's not just about blacklisting. It's blacklisting entire institutions if somebody is associated with it.\n\nMy father-in-law, who was blacklisted in the 1950s for being a communist, is a Christian now, believes in the sanctity of marriage, of the definition between a man and a woman, and they are protesting his theater in Venice, California.\n\nINGRAHAM: So right now there clearly is no real free speech in Hollywood. There's no political free speech. If major Hollywood executives don't speak out against this intimidation, they have no credibility. I don't want to see another movie about the blacklist of the 1940s and '50s. I don't want to see it again coming out of Hollywood. They have no credibility with me. None.\n\nBREITBART: Well, what's so important about this issue right now is that George Clooney is silent, and secondly, President-elect Barack Obama is against gay marriage. Joe Biden, Vice President-elect Joe Biden is against gay marriage. So were Bill and Hillary Clinton when they implemented don't ask, don't tell and the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\nWhat they have done specifically is isolate conservative groups, the Mormon Church, which is safe. I asked Michelangelo Signorile to go down to a local mosque with a group of angry activist left people and to protest the Islamic position on gay marriage. He won't do that.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nBREITBART: And he won't go after President-elect Barack Obama. President-elect Barack Obama has an aggressive attitude towards gay rights in this country, and they allow for him to get away with it.\n\nINGRAHAM: Well, Andrew, that is such a great point about the mosque. I mean, that would show true courage, OK? Go after the black churches and the mosques, and we'll see whether they're actually going to put their money where their mouths are.\n\nAndrew, thanks a lot.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2008 FOX News Network, LLC.

        "Text": "  - Bernd Debusmann is a Reuters columnist. The opinions  expressed are his own -      By Bernd Debusmann      WASHINGTON, June 18 (Reuters) - Barack Obama has won the  endorsement of the Ku Klux Klan in his bid to become the first  black president of the United States. His campaign is financed  by Hugo Chavez, the vocally anti-American leader of Venezuela.  Obama is a Muslim. And possibly, he is the anti-Christ.      So say e-mails circulating on the Internet, whose  importance as a marketplace for the exchange of unverified  information, sometimes outlandish ideas and often toxic rumors  has exploded over the last decade. It is now playing a key role  in American politics. According to a new study, almost half of  all Americans use the Internet to follow the presidential  election campaign.      Now Obama, who already made political history by becoming  the first black American to win the Democratic party's  presidential nomination, is making Internet history with a Web  site specifically set up to counter rumors about him and his  wife Michelle. It is a break with the conventional wisdom that  it is counter-productive to respond to rumor and innuendo in  the parallel world of cyberspace. Doing so, the thinking goes,  gives a rumor an air of legitimacy.      The novel Web site, fightthesmears.com, does not deal with  each and every online 'discovery' about Obama. A Ku Klux Klan  endorsement, Chavez financing, and anti-Christ suspicions are  too bizarre to rate a mention.  E-mails on these subjects were  collated by snopes.com, a Web site that features the '25  Hottest Urban Legends, currently circulating most widely.'  Obama e-mails rank No. 2 on the latest list, after e-mails on a  computer virus embedded in greeting cards.      To satisfy the curious: the Ku Klux Klan story originated  as a spoof in the satirical British publication Daily Squib and  gained currency because, as snopes.com put it, 'effective  satire hews closely to what people are inclined to believe.'   Well ... perhaps people on the lunatic fringe. The spoof quoted  a clan leader as saying that 'anything is better than Hillary  Clinton,' the New York senator who lost the primaries to  Obama.      Obama's counter-rumor Web site addresses one of the most  widely circulated, and most widely believed, assertions about  the candidate: that he is Muslim, attended a radical madrassa  (Islamic religious school) and was sworn into the U.S. Senate  using the Koran. The Obama-is-a-Muslim theme has been so  persistent that 10 percent of American voters are convinced he  is, according to a poll in March by the Pew Research Center        WIFE IS TARGET      The rumor that prompted Obama to set up the site last week  involved his wife Michelle. Right-wing bloggers spoke of the  existence of a videotape that showed her making an angry speech  featuring the word 'whitey,' a derogatory term for white  people.  'No such tape exists,' says the anti-rumor site,  'Michelle has not used that word.'      To disprove the notion that Obama was born outside the  United States and therefore ineligible to be president, the Web  site features a facsimile of his birth certificate, issued by  the Department of Health in Honolulu and dated August 8, 1961.  (Hawaii became a state in 1959).      The Internet, being an equal opportunity debating forum,  was alive with arguments earlier in the year over the  eligibility to the highest office in the land of John McCain,  Obama's Republican rival who was",

        "Text": " (Adds details, quote)      LAS VEGAS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Amid growing worries about a  worsening of the U.S. economy, Democratic presidential  candidate Barack Obama proposed a $75 billion economic stimulus  plan on Sunday that includes worker tax credits, a one-time  pension supplement and help to homeowners facing foreclosure.      The plan would include an immediate $250 tax credit to  workers that could double if the economy worsens, a one-time  $250 supplement to Social Security payments, a $10 billion fund  to help homeowners facing foreclosure and a $10 billion fund to  bolster states facing budget shortfalls amid lower tax  revenues.      'We need that middle-class tax cut now more than ever --  not five months from now or five weeks from now, but now,'  Obama said in a statement. 'I'm announcing a plan to jump-start  the economy by putting money in the pockets of those who need  it most and will spend it quickly.'      The Illinois senator's office unveiled the proposals at the  start of a day of campaigning in Nevada, which holds the next  contested Democratic primary on Saturday.      His leading rival, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, on Friday  unveiled an economic stimulus package she said would be worth  $70 billion. Her plan placed more of an emphasis on helping  families unable to make mortgage payments -- a major issue in  Nevada where 'for sale' signs are common on homes across Las  Vegas, its major city.      The plan also includes a $10 billion extension of  unemployment insurance to help those who have been unable to  find a job for more than half a year.      Last year, the senator proposed tax credits of up to $500  for 150 million workers. His revised economic plan calls for  $250 of that to come in an immediate credit, and the rest as  soon as three months later if the nation's unemployment rate  worsens.

His visit thrusts U.S. strategy in Iraq and troop levels to  the centre of the November election race between the first-term  senator from Illinois and Republican candidate John McCain.  There are more than 140,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq.      Obama has called for the removal of U.S. combat troops  within 16 months of taking office should he win the election.      Iraqiya state television and witnesses said Obama met Prime  Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad. There were no further  details on Obama's visit, which has been shrouded in secrecy for  security reasons.      Obama visited Afghanistan over the weekend, the other big  foreign policy challenge the next American president will face.  He called the situation in Afghanistan 'precarious and urgent'  and said Washington should start planning to transfer more  troops there from Iraq.      Maliki suggested earlier this month setting a timetable for  U.S. troops to leave Iraq but has given no dates.      Obama has welcomed Maliki's suggestion but some Iraqis  insist that the army and police cannot go it alone and that a  premature withdrawal of U.S. troops could open the door to the  sort of violence that nearly tore Iraq apart not so long ago.      On Sunday the Iraqi government denied Maliki told a German  magazine in an interview that he backed Obama's plan to withdraw  combat troops within 16 months. The government said Maliki's  remarks to Der Spiegel were translated incorrectly.       McCain has attacked Obama for not visiting Iraq recently to  get a first-hand look at conditions.      The Republican candidate has been to Iraq eight times while  Obama's only other trip was in January 2006, a month before  militants blew up a revered Shi'ite shrine in Samarra in an  attack that plunged Iraq into vicious sectarian fighting.      The U.S. embassy said Obama, who is visiting Iraq as part of  a U.S. congressional delegation, would also meet U.S. military  commanders and American troops.      Commanders are likely to tell Obama that security gains are  fragile and could be jeopardised by a hasty troop withdrawal.      Obama, trying to boost his foreign policy credentials, will  travel to other countries in the Middle East and visit major  powers in Europe this week.      He has scheduled no news conferences in Iraq.            OBAMA SAYS WANTS TO END THE WAR      Obama courted controversy on July 3 when he said he might  'refine' his views on withdrawing combat troops from Iraq within  16 months but later said his stance had been unchanged for more  than a year and that he intended 'to end this war'.      McCain says the U.S. troop buildup last year helped boost  stability in Iraq and has criticised the Democrat's vow to order  a quick withdrawal as 'reckless'.      But the dramatic reduction in violence has led Baghdad to  become increasingly assertive about its own security  capabilities.      Indeed, Maliki and President George W. Bush agreed last week  to set a 'time horizon' for reducing American forces in Iraq.      It was the closest the",
