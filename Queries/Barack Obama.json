        "Text": "A year after electing Barack Obama president, and five years after his star turn at the Democratic National Convention, we are still trying to figure him out.\n\nIs he a left-wing radical or is he a crowd-pleasing moderate? Is he a uniter? Is he actually religious? Is he a socialist? Does he hate America? And, in light of the confidence he projects, why can\u2019t he seem to take criticism?\n\nBut we could, of course, write that first sentence another way: Only a year after electing Barack Obama president, and we are already trying to figure him out.\n\nRather than it being kind of late to attempt a rigorous analysis of President Obama\u2019s psyche, his political philosophy and his managerial style, perhaps it\u2019s a little too soon. Presidential personalities, after all, develop over time. And the famous saying is true that great leaders aren\u2019t born, but made.\n\nNonetheless, because I\u2019m too young for caution, and too old for fear, I\u2019m more than happy to take a stab at it.\n\nLet me first assuage the fears of many of my conservative friends and colleagues: Barack Obama is not a left-wing radical. He is not a socialist, a communist or a Marxist, and he\u2019s not a black liberation theologist. He\u2019s not un-American, he\u2019s not an atheist, and he\u2019s not a racist.\n\nHe is none of those things, because all would require Barack Obama to have a belief system, a worldview, a set of convictions about political philosophy, theology, and socioeconomics that he simply doesn\u2019t have. He is, instead, empty. He is an empty vessel.\n\nThis will shock and offend his legion of admirers on the left, as it stands in stark contrast to the breathless, leg-thrilling declarations by liberal America that Obama is a deep-thinking, complex, contemplative scholar of soaring intellect, a new kind of leader, exquisitely built for a changing world, who knows the war isn\u2019t between good and evil, but between silence and diplomacy, and for whom indecision is a mark of judicious caution.\n\nBut he\u2019d done nothing to deserve those early accolades, of course. So all of that was pre-ordained and pre-packaged, the result of a coordinated and deliberate campaign by a coalition of marketers, politicos, and members of the press to brand Barack Obama as \u201chope and change\u201d before anyone even knew what his selling points were, or if he actually had any.\n\nThe proof of his ideological emptiness is practically undeniable. He has been, over the short course of his political career, the great abandoner, ever-willing to denounce those ideals that were previously sold to his constituents as \u201chis convictions.\u201d\n\nAfter 20 years in Reverend Wright\u2019s church, he simply got up and left. The man who baptized his children, who was marketed (to black voters in particular) as Obama\u2019s spiritual adviser, who was so integral in shaping Barack Obama\u2019s adult life, that he publicly denounced him, and left his church altogether. And he also denounced black liberation theology, despite giving numerous interviews about the ways in which it had helped shape his religious worldview. After initially defending Rev. Wright, suddenly he and his brand of religion were chucked out the window of a moving campaign bus. He has yet to find a replacement, unsurprisingly, but his interest in evangelicals like Rick Warren and Carey Cash means he is open to the theological polar opposite of Rev. Wright.\n\nThe same sort of dance occurred with other politically inconvenient allies, like domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, Wright apologist Father Michael Pfleger, and convicted felon Tony Rezko. Obama distanced himself from all of them and then eventually dumped them altogether when it became politically necessary. Van Jones was merely a post-election victim of Obama\u2019s willing abandonment. And there have been others.\n\nSo would a real radical disown his radical mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s? Would a real extremist and true-believer insist with a straight face that he didn\u2019t really believe all that stuff? Would a real ideologue be persuaded by a public opinion poll to abandon whole ideology?\n\nActual radicals like Wright and Ayers and Jones defend their beliefs, regardless of the pushback and potential fallout. What Obama did, in contrast, was purely political. Because, despite the insistence by the left that Obama somehow transcends politics, that\u2019s what he is \u2013 a politician. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nWe can also look at the shift in his policy positions over the past few years. He was once quoted as saying that he supported a single-payer health care system. The best political decision now, however, was to abandon that for a more docile public option. Once that failed to garner the groundswell of support his advisers thought it would, he appeared altogether indifferent to it. If he were reallya radical, he\u2019d be rallying us around universal health care right now, not some watered-down 1990-page bureaucratic hodge podge that is neither revolutionary nor practical.\n\nHis impassioned pledges to end \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d close Gitmo, bring troops home, end military tribunals, and myriad other promises, suddenly seem less like the stuff of real political conviction, and more like political headaches that require a clever exit strategy.\n\nAnd his reaction to any kind of opposition \u2013 from the right, from the citizenry, from Fox News \u2013 is equally telling. If Obama\u2019s agenda were based on conviction instead of political expedience and an unquenchable thirst for popularity, criticism would bounce right off him. Instead he seems frighteningly flappable. That\u2019s because leadership without convictions is leadership of empty rhetoric. Convictions can be defended against criticism. Empty rhetoric cannot.\n\nSo why all the radical friends and the radical proposals and the radical rhetoric if he\u2019s not himself a radical? Because his lack of conviction and his inability to forge his own philosophical and theological identity, have made him incredibly susceptible to external influence and pressure. He is easily led. He is, as such, the perfect prospect for someone like Bill Ayers or Reverend Wright, whose radical agendas require vulnerable recruits who are malleable and willing.\n\nI don\u2019t know if President Obama is a man of conviction, if he is a man of faith, or if he is the intellectual giant the left really wants him to be. He very well may be all of those things. But I haven\u2019t seen proof of any of it yet, and neither have you, because there hasn\u2019t been any.\n\nThe only thing we do know for sure, one year after anointing this relative unknown the forty-fourth president of the United States, is that he\u2019s a politician, pure and simple. Calling him a radical gives him way too much credit.\n\nS.E. Cupp is a write and co-author of \"Why You're Wrong About the Right.\" She is a frequent contributor to the Fox Forum.",

        "Text": "    Jan 20 (Reuters) - Barack Obama will be sworn in as the  44th president of the United States at noon on Tuesday.      Here are some biographical facts about the first  African-American to hold the nation's highest office.        Age: 47      Birthdate: Aug. 4, 1961      Birthplace: Honolulu, Hawaii      Education: Columbia University; Harvard Law School      Wife: Michelle Robinson Obama      Children: Daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7      Religious affiliation: United Church of Christ      Party: Democrat        Family: Barack Obama was born to a Kenyan father and a  white American mother. His father, Barack Obama Sr., married  his mother, Ann Dunham, while studying at the University of  Hawaii. The couple separated two years after Obama was born.  His father ultimately returned to Kenya, where he became a  noted economist. He died in a car accident in 1982.      Obama's mother's second marriage was to an Indonesian man  named Lolo Soetoro. The family moved to Indonesia and Obama  remained there until he was 10 when he moved back to Hawaii and  lived with his grandparents while studying on a scholarship at  the elite Punahou Academy.      He has seven half brothers and sisters in Kenya from his  father's other marriages, and a half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng,  from his mother's second marriage.        Career: After finishing college in 1983, Obama worked for a  New York financial consultancy and a consumer organization. He  landed a job in Chicago in 1985 as an organizer for Developing  Communities Project, a church-based group seeking to improve  living conditions in poor neighborhoods.      Three years later, Obama left to go to Harvard Law School,  where he became the first black president of the law review. He  worked as a summer associate at the Sidley Austin law firm in  Chicago, where he met his future wife. After graduation from  Harvard in 1991, Obama practiced civil rights law at a small  firm in Chicago, then became a lecturer in constitutional law  at the University of Chicago in 1993.        Elective office: Obama won a seat in the Illinois state  Senate in 1996. During his time in the Legislature, he worked  on welfare and ethics legislation, as well as a measure  requiring electronic recording of police interrogations and  confessions in homicide investigations.      Obama won a heavily contested U.S. Senate seat in 2004,  carrying 53 percent of the Democratic primary vote in an  eight-candidate race. He easily won the general election as  well. In the U.S. Senate he compiled a liberal voting record,  but was one of the few Democrats to back a measure on  class-action lawsuits. He opposed the appointment of Chief  Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito to the U.S.  Supreme Court.      The nonpartisan National Journal ranked him as the most  liberal member of the U.S. Senate early this year based on his  voting record in 2007. He was ranked 10th most liberal in 2006  and 16th most liberal in 2005.           Presidential campaign: Obama announced his presidential  candidacy on Feb. 10, 2007. Though New York Sen. Hillary  Clinton was initially seen as the front-runner for the  Democratic nomination, Obama quickly showed an ability to raise  large amounts of money and draw record-breaking crowds who were  attracted to his rhetorical skill, his opposition to the Iraq  war, and his promise to move beyond the divisive politics of  the past 40 years.      Obama won the first contest of the Democratic primary in  Iowa in",

        "Text": "(Refile to update headline)      Nov 5 (Reuters) - Barack Obama is the U.S. president-elect.  Following are some of his biographical details:        Age: 47      Birthdate: Aug. 4, 1961      Birthplace: Honolulu, Hawaii      Education: Columbia University; Harvard Law School      Wife: Michelle Robinson      Children: Two daughters      Religious affiliation: United Church of Christ        Family: Barack Obama was born in Hawaii to a Kenyan father  and a white American mother. His father, Barack Obama Sr.,  married his mother, Ann Dunham, while studying at the  University of Hawaii. The couple separated two years after  Obama was born. His father ultimately returned to Kenya, where  he became a noted economist. He died in a car accident in 1982.      Obama's mother's second marriage was to an Indonesian man  named Lolo Soetoro. The family moved to Indonesia and Obama  remained there until he was 10 when he moved back to Hawaii and  lived with his grandparents while studying on a scholarship at  the elite Punahou Academy.      He has seven half brothers and sisters in Kenya from his  father's other marriages, and a half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng,  from his mother's second marriage.        Career: After finishing college in 1983, Obama worked for a  New York financial consultant and a consumer organization. He  landed a job in Chicago in 1985 as an organizer for Developing  Communities Project, a church-based group seeking to improve  living conditions in poor neighborhoods.      Three years later, Obama left to go to Harvard Law School,  where he became the first black president of the law review. He  worked as a summer associate at the Sidley Austin law firm in  Chicago, where he met his future wife. After graduation from  Harvard in 1991, Obama practiced civil rights law at a small  firm in Chicago, then became a lecturer in constitutional law  at the University of Chicago in 1993.        Elective office: Obama won a seat in the Illinois state  Senate in 1996. During his time in the legislature, he worked  on welfare and ethics legislation, as well as a measure  requiring electronic recording of police interrogations and  confessions in homicide investigations.      Obama won a heavily contested U.S. Senate seat in 2004,  carrying 53 percent of the Democratic primary vote in an  eight-candidate race. He easily won the general election. In  the Senate he compiled a liberal voting record, but was one of  the few Democrats to back a measure on class-action lawsuits.  He opposed the appointment of Chief Justice John Roberts and  Justice Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court.      The nonpartisan National Journal ranked him as the most  liberal member of the Senate early this year based on his  voting record in 2007. He was ranked 10th most liberal in 2006  and 16th most liberal in 2005.

The plan would include an immediate $250 tax credit to workers  that could double if the economy worsens; a one-time $250  supplement to Social Security retirement payments, a $10 billion  fund to help homeowners facing foreclosure, and a $10 billion fund  to bolster states facing budget shortfalls.      The Illinois senator's office unveiled the proposals while  campaigning in Nevada, which holds the next contested Democratic  primary on Saturday. His leading rival, New York Sen. Hillary  Clinton, also recently unveiled an economic stimulus package.

        "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Barack Obama was voted the  most influential man of 2008 in an online poll released on  Tuesday that asked men to decide who most impacted the way they  behave, buy and think.      The U.S. Democratic presidential candidate was ranked No.1  by readers on the AskMen.com lifestyle Web site, beating Apple  chief executive Steve Jobs and Olympic swimming champion  Michael Phelps, who landed in the No. 2 and No. 3 spots,  respectively.      Republican presidential candidate John McCain was ranked  No. 10 on the list, which was compiled on the basis of 200,000  votes from readers of the Web site whose average age is 27-28  years-old.      Last year's winner, British soccer star David Beckham, fell  to No. 25 on the 2008 list, which asked men to go beyond  professional success and likability when picking their top 49  choices.      James Bassil, editor-in-chief of AskMen.com, said he  thought Obama's top place was not so much a political  endorsement of his candidacy as 'a reflection of the interest  the presidential race has ignited in the United States.'      Stephen Colbert, host of the satirical news show 'The  Colbert Report,' was the only other politically-minded name in  the Top 10 of the 2008 list, which was dominated by sports  stars, actors and musicians.

Here are five facts about the Illinois Senator who aims to  become the first black president of the United States:           *Obama's father was born and raised in a village in Kenya; his  mother, who was white, grew up in Kansas.           *Obama grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia. He earned his law  degree from Harvard in 1991 and was the first African-American  president of the Harvard Law Review.           *He is married to wife Michelle and has two young  daughters.           *He was a member of the Illinois State Senate before being  elected to the U.S. Senate. His speech at the Democratic  National Convention in 2004 earned him national attention and  acclaim.           *On issues key to many Democratic voters, Obama favors  withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq, reducing carbon emissions to  fight climate change, and eliminating tax breaks from companies  that move jobs overseas.

        "Text": "Tension is rising between India and Pakistan because it looks like the killers who attacked Mumbai were based inside Pakistani territory. If shooting breaks out between these two countries, the world will have yet another crisis created by Muslim terrorists.\n\nIt is obvious to sane people that the American intelligence agencies must continue to stay ahead of the terror-killers and disrupt plots like Mumbai should they be directed here. To do that, information from captured terror suspects becomes vital.\n\nBut President-elect Obama has committed himself to an undefined no torture policy and is also having some difficulty finding someone to head up the CIA. Former CIA Chief of Staff John Brennan has taken himself out of the running because some far-left loons criticized him for taking an aggressive anti-terror stance after 9/11.\n\nThis is very disturbing. The far-left wants the CIA to go by the Army Field Manual when interrogating suspects. If that happens, all of us will be in danger.\n\nWhy? Well, here's what the manual says: \"Prisoners of war who refuse to answer (questions) may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.\"\n\nNow \u2014 and this is important \u2014 that is fine for the military. It is not their job to break down terror suspects. It's their job to kill or capture them on the battlefield. The CIA should interrogate high-value targets.\n\nBut if Obama orders the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies not to employ any tough interrogation methods, trust me, many people will die. The terrorists are not going to stop, and only very aggressive action against them has kept us safe since 9/11.\n\nBut these far-left loons, these despicable people who blame America for worldwide terrorism, now have far more power in this country than they did just one month ago.\n\nI believe Barack Obama understands the danger the Muslim terrorists pose to the world. I believe Mr. Obama will not destroy the CIA's ability to break down terror suspects. He has to know that hardcore terrorists are not going to give up information easily.\n\nBut still some people don't get it, and these people are foolish and dangerous, so crazed by their far-left ideology they'd allow innocent people to die for it.\n\nThe USA should never torture, but coerced interrogation at the direction of the president is vital when lives are on the line. Of course, the loons will never acknowledge that. They don't want to do anything \"unpleasant\" to terror suspects.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nAs you may know, actor Patrick Swayze is waging a valiant fight against pancreatic cancer. The 56-year-old actor is working on a new TV show and generally fighting the good fight.\n\nBut a number of tabloids continue to sound the death knell for him, and Mr. Swayze would like them to knock it off. We hope they do, because the man is brave and a patriot.\n\nOn the pinhead front, you make the call on this one. At the opening of a new visitors' center at the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said this:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID, D-NEV.: My staff has always said, \"Don't say this,\" but I'm going to say it again, because it's so descriptive, because it's true.\n\nLeader Boehner mentioned that tourists lined up in the summer and winter, long lines coming into the Capitol. In the summertime, because of the high humidity and how hot it gets here, you could literally smell the tourists coming into the Capitol.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nNo matter how bad the folks smell, it doesn't compete with some of the stuff going on in the Senate.\n\nPinhead? You make the call.\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads & Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

        "Text": "    By Caren Bohan      EVANSVILLE, Ind., April 23 (Reuters) - Barack Obama's rapid  rise from relative obscurity toward winning the Democratic  Party nomination for U.S. president hit another bump when he  lost to rival Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania.      Obama's defeat on Tuesday in the state's nominating contest  slowed his momentum, but he still holds the lead in delegates  who will decide the party's nominee to run against Republican  John McCain in the November presidential election.      Just four years after he burst onto the national political  scene with a keynote speech at the Democratic Party convention,  the questions for those deciding whether to support Obama have  been mostly about his relative inexperience.      Is the 46-year-old first-term senator who would be the  first black U.S. president just a 'phenomenon' desired by a  war-weary nation eager for a fresh face or does he have what it  takes to be an effective president?      Obama cast his scant time on the national political scene  as an advantage, saying it meant his hope and ideals had not  been compromised. His rousing oratory and can-do message struck  a chord early with the public, drawing large crowds and  enthusing young voters.      Doubts over whether voters were 'ready' for a black  president diminished as he steadily chipped away at Clinton's  large early lead and eventually moved past her in the long  run-up to the presidential election.      Once the race was down to two Democratic candidates, there  was little to distinguish them on policy issues.           MULTICULTURAL AMERICA      Obama often points to his roots -- his father was Kenyan  and his mother a white woman from Kansas -- as one reason he  should be picked to run the country, saying he is   representative of multicultural America.      One of his favorite lines --- 'When you're a black guy  named Barack Obama and you're running for president you've got  to have hope' -- regularly draws laughs.      But it is clear Obama has also asked serious questions  about his heritage.      A two-time bestselling author who also won two Grammy  awards for the audio version of his books, Obama chronicled his  struggles to understand himself and his race in 1995 in 'Dreams  from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance.'      He followed up the memoir in 2006 with 'The Audacity of  Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream' outlining his  political principles.      While attracting wide support among African Americans,  Obama eschewed the rhetoric of race struggle and structured his  campaign to appeal to all races.      He has also described himself as a 'blank screen' on which  people of all different political leanings can project their  own views.        CLOSER SCRUTINY      As he moved ahead in the polls and the race for delegates  who pick the party nominee, Democratic and Republican opponents  took a closer look at his record and associates.      Video of Jeremiah Wright, his black pastor at the Trinity  United Church of Christ in Chicago, giving racially and  politically charged sermons, including saying U.S. policies  were partially responsible for Sept. 11 attacks, surfaced on  the Internet in March.      Obama, who borrowed the words 'audacity of hope' from  Wright, was forced to disavow his pastor and ended up giving a  much-praised speech on race in America.      Suddenly, every word and action was under a microscope.  Comments to a closed-door fund-raiser earlier this month sayi",

        "Text": "  - Bernd Debusmann is a Reuters columnist. The opinions  expressed are his own -      By Bernd Debusmann      WASHINGTON, June 18 (Reuters) - Barack Obama has won the  endorsement of the Ku Klux Klan in his bid to become the first  black president of the United States. His campaign is financed  by Hugo Chavez, the vocally anti-American leader of Venezuela.  Obama is a Muslim. And possibly, he is the anti-Christ.      So say e-mails circulating on the Internet, whose  importance as a marketplace for the exchange of unverified  information, sometimes outlandish ideas and often toxic rumors  has exploded over the last decade. It is now playing a key role  in American politics. According to a new study, almost half of  all Americans use the Internet to follow the presidential  election campaign.      Now Obama, who already made political history by becoming  the first black American to win the Democratic party's  presidential nomination, is making Internet history with a Web  site specifically set up to counter rumors about him and his  wife Michelle. It is a break with the conventional wisdom that  it is counter-productive to respond to rumor and innuendo in  the parallel world of cyberspace. Doing so, the thinking goes,  gives a rumor an air of legitimacy.      The novel Web site, fightthesmears.com, does not deal with  each and every online 'discovery' about Obama. A Ku Klux Klan  endorsement, Chavez financing, and anti-Christ suspicions are  too bizarre to rate a mention.  E-mails on these subjects were  collated by snopes.com, a Web site that features the '25  Hottest Urban Legends, currently circulating most widely.'  Obama e-mails rank No. 2 on the latest list, after e-mails on a  computer virus embedded in greeting cards.      To satisfy the curious: the Ku Klux Klan story originated  as a spoof in the satirical British publication Daily Squib and  gained currency because, as snopes.com put it, 'effective  satire hews closely to what people are inclined to believe.'   Well ... perhaps people on the lunatic fringe. The spoof quoted  a clan leader as saying that 'anything is better than Hillary  Clinton,' the New York senator who lost the primaries to  Obama.      Obama's counter-rumor Web site addresses one of the most  widely circulated, and most widely believed, assertions about  the candidate: that he is Muslim, attended a radical madrassa  (Islamic religious school) and was sworn into the U.S. Senate  using the Koran. The Obama-is-a-Muslim theme has been so  persistent that 10 percent of American voters are convinced he  is, according to a poll in March by the Pew Research Center        WIFE IS TARGET      The rumor that prompted Obama to set up the site last week  involved his wife Michelle. Right-wing bloggers spoke of the  existence of a videotape that showed her making an angry speech  featuring the word 'whitey,' a derogatory term for white  people.  'No such tape exists,' says the anti-rumor site,  'Michelle has not used that word.'      To disprove the notion that Obama was born outside the  United States and therefore ineligible to be president, the Web  site features a facsimile of his birth certificate, issued by  the Department of Health in Honolulu and dated August 8, 1961.  (Hawaii became a state in 1959).      The Internet, being an equal opportunity debating forum,  was alive with arguments earlier in the year over the  eligibility to the highest office in the land of John McCain,  Obama's Republican rival who was",

        "Text": " (Adds details, quote)      LAS VEGAS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Amid growing worries about a  worsening of the U.S. economy, Democratic presidential  candidate Barack Obama proposed a $75 billion economic stimulus  plan on Sunday that includes worker tax credits, a one-time  pension supplement and help to homeowners facing foreclosure.      The plan would include an immediate $250 tax credit to  workers that could double if the economy worsens, a one-time  $250 supplement to Social Security payments, a $10 billion fund  to help homeowners facing foreclosure and a $10 billion fund to  bolster states facing budget shortfalls amid lower tax  revenues.      'We need that middle-class tax cut now more than ever --  not five months from now or five weeks from now, but now,'  Obama said in a statement. 'I'm announcing a plan to jump-start  the economy by putting money in the pockets of those who need  it most and will spend it quickly.'      The Illinois senator's office unveiled the proposals at the  start of a day of campaigning in Nevada, which holds the next  contested Democratic primary on Saturday.      His leading rival, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, on Friday  unveiled an economic stimulus package she said would be worth  $70 billion. Her plan placed more of an emphasis on helping  families unable to make mortgage payments -- a major issue in  Nevada where 'for sale' signs are common on homes across Las  Vegas, its major city.      The plan also includes a $10 billion extension of  unemployment insurance to help those who have been unable to  find a job for more than half a year.      Last year, the senator proposed tax credits of up to $500  for 150 million workers. His revised economic plan calls for  $250 of that to come in an immediate credit, and the rest as  soon as three months later if the nation's unemployment rate  worsens.

His visit thrusts U.S. strategy in Iraq and troop levels to  the centre of the November election race between the first-term  senator from Illinois and Republican candidate John McCain.  There are more than 140,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq.      Obama has called for the removal of U.S. combat troops  within 16 months of taking office should he win the election.      Iraqiya state television and witnesses said Obama met Prime  Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad. There were no further  details on Obama's visit, which has been shrouded in secrecy for  security reasons.      Obama visited Afghanistan over the weekend, the other big  foreign policy challenge the next American president will face.  He called the situation in Afghanistan 'precarious and urgent'  and said Washington should start planning to transfer more  troops there from Iraq.      Maliki suggested earlier this month setting a timetable for  U.S. troops to leave Iraq but has given no dates.      Obama has welcomed Maliki's suggestion but some Iraqis  insist that the army and police cannot go it alone and that a  premature withdrawal of U.S. troops could open the door to the  sort of violence that nearly tore Iraq apart not so long ago.      On Sunday the Iraqi government denied Maliki told a German  magazine in an interview that he backed Obama's plan to withdraw  combat troops within 16 months. The government said Maliki's  remarks to Der Spiegel were translated incorrectly.       McCain has attacked Obama for not visiting Iraq recently to  get a first-hand look at conditions.      The Republican candidate has been to Iraq eight times while  Obama's only other trip was in January 2006, a month before  militants blew up a revered Shi'ite shrine in Samarra in an  attack that plunged Iraq into vicious sectarian fighting.      The U.S. embassy said Obama, who is visiting Iraq as part of  a U.S. congressional delegation, would also meet U.S. military  commanders and American troops.      Commanders are likely to tell Obama that security gains are  fragile and could be jeopardised by a hasty troop withdrawal.      Obama, trying to boost his foreign policy credentials, will  travel to other countries in the Middle East and visit major  powers in Europe this week.      He has scheduled no news conferences in Iraq.            OBAMA SAYS WANTS TO END THE WAR      Obama courted controversy on July 3 when he said he might  'refine' his views on withdrawing combat troops from Iraq within  16 months but later said his stance had been unchanged for more  than a year and that he intended 'to end this war'.      McCain says the U.S. troop buildup last year helped boost  stability in Iraq and has criticised the Democrat's vow to order  a quick withdrawal as 'reckless'.      But the dramatic reduction in violence has led Baghdad to  become increasingly assertive about its own security  capabilities.      Indeed, Maliki and President George W. Bush agreed last week  to set a 'time horizon' for reducing American forces in Iraq.      It was the closest the",

        "Text": " (Adds Obama's economic adviser)      By Adam Tanner      LAS VEGAS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Amid growing worries about a  worsening of the U.S. economy, Democratic presidential  candidate Barack Obama proposed a $75 billion economic stimulus  plan on Sunday that includes worker tax credits, a one-time  pension supplement and help to homeowners facing foreclosure.      The plan would include an immediate $250 tax credit for  workers, which could double if the economy worsens, a one-time  $250 supplement to Social Security payments, a $10 billion fund  to help homeowners facing foreclosure and a $10 billion fund to  assist states facing budget shortfalls amid lower tax  revenues.      'We need that middle-class tax cut now more than ever --  not five months from now or five weeks from now, but now,'  Obama said in a statement. 'I'm announcing a plan to jump-start  the economy by putting money in the pockets of those who need  it most and will spend it quickly.'      If he won his party's nomination and then the November  election, Obama would take office in January 2009.      The Illinois senator's office unveiled the proposals at the  start of a day of campaigning in Nevada, which holds the next  contested Democratic primary on Saturday.      The 'goal would be to help the U.S. economy from going into  recession,' his economic advisor Austan Goolsbee told  reporters.      Obama's leading rival, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, on  Friday unveiled an economic stimulus package she said would be  worth $70 billion. Her plan placed more of an emphasis on  helping families unable to make mortgage payments -- a major  issue in Nevada where 'for sale' signs are common on homes  around heavily populated Las Vegas.      'There are some similarities,' Goolsbee said of the two  plans. The biggest difference with Obama's plan is that 'the  absolutely most imperative thing is to get the money into the  people's hands immediately so they can spent it.'      'The stimulus does increase the deficit in the immediate  term,' the economic adviser said, adding that preventing a  recession could have 'profound' budget implications.      The Obama plan also includes a $10 billion extension of  unemployment insurance to help those who have been unable to  find a job for more than six months.      The foreclosure help plan would be aimed at 'responsible  homeowners' who live in their primary residences, Goolsbee  said. Las Vegas has been hit hard by the subprime loan crisis,  but many of those suffering bought additional houses hoping  that fast rising prices amid a prosperous local economy would  lead to easy money.      Last year, Obama proposed tax credits of up to $500 for 150  million workers. His revised economic plan calls for $250 of  that to come in an immediate credit, and the rest as soon as  three months later if the nation's unemployment rate worsens.

        "Text": "With the announcement Friday that President Obama will leave about 50,000 troops in Iraq after the bulk of U.S. forces withdraw in 2010, it is becoming clear that on foreign policy the president will govern from the center.\n\nBut it is also now certain that he is a far-left guy on domestic policy. The new budget is simply stunning. Mr. Obama wants to spend more money than at any time since World War II.\n\nPredictably, quasi-socialists like New York Times columnist Paul Krugman are delirious with joy. Here comes the nanny state, starring President Obama and Fran Drescher.\n\nAlso predictably, conservatives like Glenn Beck are outfitting caves in the mountains. The decline and fall of America is at hand.\n\n\"Talking Points\" cannot imagine any Republican senator supporting the massive budget, so it will have trouble getting passed.\n\nBut the die has been cast. President Obama is \"all in\" for a colossal change in American society. That change means the rich will support the poor. Americans who do not succeed will have their bills paid by people like me \u2014 and Barack Obama when he becomes a private citizen again.\n\nThat also means we'll have some kind of new energy in this country, but nobody knows when or what. However, there's plenty of money that will fund the mystery.\n\nAnd gazillions more dollars will flow into America's schools. What this will do, I don't know because if the kids walk around all day with iPods in their ears and rings in their noses, money simply won't matter.\n\nNow, \"Talking Points\" knows he's a mean guy. Criticizing the kids? Come on, how can I do that? Whining about paying other people's bills? That's just downright mean, is it not?\n\nWell that's how the far-left is portraying it. Listen to this new commercial from some progressive loons:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: An economy in crisis, a president determined to act, but what did Republican leaders say to President Obama's jobs and recovery plan?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did they say to 3.5 million jobs?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did they say to tax cuts for 95 percent of working Americans?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: So who are Republican leaders listening to?\n\nRUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: I want him to fail.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tell them America won't take no for an answer anymore.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nThat's what passes for debate these days on the far left: running down anyone with whom they disagree.\n\nBut as \"Talking Points\" said Thursday night, President Obama is taking an enormous gamble, one that will affect all of our lives. He has audacity, no question. But the outcome is still mostly hope.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nOnce a year the Filene's Basement department store here in New York City mounts a sale called the \"Running of the Brides.\" The ladies line up hours ahead of time to get discounts on wedding dresses, and then when the doors open the track meet begins. The excitement is generated by dresses that once cost thousands of dollars marked down to hundreds of dollars.\n\nNow this might be a stretch, but I'm making the ladies patriots because they are thrifty, and we need that in America. So there.\n\nOn the pinhead front, welcome to Will Ferrell's world. The comedian, currently starring in the hit Broadway play about President Bush, started out as the \"Senior Prince of the Winter Ball\" at University High School in Irvine, California.\n\nClick here to see the picture!\n\nNow anyone seeing this picture back then could have predicted Mr. Ferrell would achieve great success. The only mystery: in what area?\n\nPinhead? You make the call.\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads & Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

        "Text": "    * Obama to meet Iraqi leaders, U.S. commanders      * Wants U.S. combat troops out in 16 months if wins election      * Obama last visited Iraq in January 2006            By Dean Yates      BAGHDAD, July 21 (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential  candidate Barack Obama flew into Baghdad on Monday, officials  said, thrusting U.S. strategy in Iraq and troop levels to the  centre-stage of the November election race.      Obama has called for the removal of U.S. combat troops from  Iraq within 16 months of taking office should he win the  election. He visited Afghanistan over the weekend, the other big  foreign policy challenge the next American president will face.      Obama has come under attack from Republican candidate John  McCain for not making a recent visit to assess conditions in  Iraq, where violence is at a four-year low. McCain has been to  Iraq eight times while Obama's only other trip was in 2006.      The U.S. embassy said Obama, who is visiting Iraq as part of  a U.S. congressional delegation, would meet senior Iraqi  officials and U.S. military commanders.      Seeking to boost his foreign policy credentials, Obama will  travel to other countries in the Middle East and also visit  major powers in Europe this week.      Obama courted controversy on July 3 when he said he might  'refine' his views on withdrawing combat troops from Iraq within  16 months but later said his stance had been unchanged for more  than a year and that he intended 'to end this war'.      McCain says a U.S. troop buildup last year helped boost  stability in Iraq and has criticised Democrats' vows for a quick  withdrawal as 'reckless'.      But with violence down dramatically, Baghdad has become  increasingly assertive about its own security capabilities.      Indeed, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and President  George W. Bush agreed late last week to set a 'time horizon' for  reducing American forces in Iraq.      It was the closest the Bush administration has come to  acknowledging the need for a timeframe for U.S. troop cuts. Bush  has long opposed deadlines for troop withdrawals.      Maliki earlier this month suggested setting a timetable for  U.S. troops to leave Iraq, although he had given no dates.      But the Iraqi government has denied Maliki told a German  magazine in an interview released on Saturday that he backed  Obama's plan to withdraw combat troops within 16 months.      The government has said Maliki's remarks to Der Spiegel were  misunderstood and translated incorrectly.       In a speech last Tuesday, Obama said a 'single-minded' focus  on Iraq was distracting the United States from other threats,  and he promised to shift resources to fighting al Qaeda and the  Taliban in Afghanistan.      Obama called the situation in Afghanistan 'precarious and  urgent' on Sunday and said Washington should start planning to  transfer more troops there from Iraq.

        "Text": "    * Obama to meet Iraqi leaders, U.S. commanders      * Wants U.S. combat troops out in 16 months if wins election      * Obama last visited Iraq in January 2006            By Dean Yates      BAGHDAD, July 21 (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential  candidate Barack Obama flew into Iraq on Monday, thrusting U.S.  strategy in the country and troop levels to the centre-stage of  the November election race.      Obama has called for the removal of U.S. combat troops from  Iraq within 16 months of taking office should he win the  election. He visited Afghanistan over the weekend, the other big  foreign policy challenge the next American president will face.      Obama has come under attack from Republican candidate John  McCain for not making a recent visit to assess conditions in  Iraq, where violence is at a four-year low. McCain has been to  Iraq eight times while Obama's only other trip was in 2006.      The U.S. embassy said Obama, who is visiting Iraq as part of  a U.S. congressional delegation, would meet senior Iraqi  officials, U.S. military commanders and American troops. He does  not have any news conferences scheduled while in Iraq.      Seeking to boost his foreign policy credentials, Obama will  travel to other countries in the Middle East and also visit  major powers in Europe this week.      Obama courted controversy on July 3 when he said he might  'refine' his views on withdrawing combat troops from Iraq within  16 months but later said his stance had been unchanged for more  than a year and that he intended 'to end this war'.      McCain says a U.S. troop buildup last year helped boost  stability in Iraq and has criticised Democrats' vows for a quick  withdrawal as 'reckless'.      But with violence down dramatically, Baghdad has become  increasingly assertive about its own security capabilities.      Indeed, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and President  George W. Bush agreed late last week to set a 'time horizon' for  reducing American forces in Iraq.      It was the closest the Bush administration has come to  acknowledging the need for a timeframe for U.S. troop cuts. Bush  has long opposed deadlines for troop withdrawals.            OBAMA WELCOMED MALIKI'S TIMETABLE IDEA      Maliki earlier this month suggested setting a timetable for  U.S. troops to leave Iraq, although he had given no dates.      Obama has welcomed Maliki's suggestion but some Iraqis  insist the army and police cannot go it alone and that a  premature withdrawal of U.S. troops could open the door to the  sort of violence that nearly tore Iraq apart not so long ago.      On Sunday the Iraqi government denied Maliki told a German  magazine in an interview that he backed Obama's plan to withdraw  combat troops within 16 months. The government said Maliki's  remarks to Der Spiegel were translated incorrectly.       In a speech last Tuesday, Obama said a 'single-minded' focus  on Iraq was distracting the United States from other threats,  and he promised to shift resources to fighting al Qaeda and the  Taliban in Afghanistan.      Obama called the situation in Afghanistan 'precarious and  urgent' on Sunday and said Washington should start planning to  transfer more troops there from Iraq.      Bush ordered 30,000 extra troops to Iraq in early 2007 to  try to drag the country back from the brink of all-out war  between majority Shi'ites and minority Sunni Arabs.      The last of those reinforcements depart Iraq this week,  still leaving 140,000 U.",
