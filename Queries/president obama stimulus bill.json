        "Text": "    President Barack Obama signed a $787 billion economic stimulus  bill into law Tuesday as global markets plunged on fears that the  recession would deepen despite government action in many  countries.      Obama, who has described the package as one part of a plan  to solve his country's economic ills, was expected to lay out a  strategy on Wednesday to stem home foreclosures and address the  housing crisis that sparked the financial sector meltdown.      Meanwhile financially strapped General Motors Corp and  Chrysler raced to finish restructuring plans that must be  submitted to the Obama administration by the end of the day as  part of efforts to keep America's biggest carmakers afloat.

'I will sign this legislation into law shortly, and we'll  begin making the immediate investments necessary to put people  back to work,' Obama said, savoring his biggest legislative  victory since taking office on Jan. 20.      The Senate cast the final vote, 60-38, late on Friday,  hours after the House of Representatives passed an identical  bill, 246-183, capping weeks of arguing over how to best jolt  the economy out of deep recession.      Obama and his fellow Democrats who control Congress failed  to win over many Republicans, falling short of the broad  bipartisan support he sought for the massive package of  increased spending and tax cuts.      But Obama brushed off partisan bickering over the stimulus  bill as 'healthy differences of opinion.'      'Congress has passed my economic recovery plan -- an  ambitious plan at a time we badly need it,' he said in his  weekly radio address delivered during his first trip home to  Chicago since assuming the presidency. 'This is a major  milestone on our road to recovery.'      Obama, who had warned that economic crisis could turn to  catastrophe without rapid government intervention, said the  stimulus would 'lay a new foundation' for lasting growth.      The White House has said it will take about a month for the  money to start flowing. But a primary concern for economists is  that the stimulus will come too late to do much good in 2009,  when many forecasters think full-year output will contract.           MUCH-NEEDED BOOST      Despite that, final passage of the stimulus bill gives a  much-needed boost to the new president, whose 'No-drama Obama'  image has come under strain of late.      He has had an uneven start, dealing with an uproar over the  tax problems of several top Cabinet choices and the abrupt  withdrawal last week of his nominee for commerce secretary,  Republican Sen. Judd Gregg, citing policy differences.      But Obama has kept his approval ratings high by tackling  the economy as his top domestic priority. His recipe includes   middle-class tax cuts, infrastructure spending, help for the  poor and unemployed and investment in alternative energy.      He predicts that the stimulus plan will save or create more  than 3.5 million jobs over the next two years.      But the stimulus debate in Congress has also laid bare  bitter divisions over how to boost an economy suffering a  rising jobless rate of 7.6 percent and a banking crisis that  has nearly frozen lending.      Only three Republicans voted for the measure in the  100-seat Senate, and no Republicans broke ranks to support it  the House, arguing it had too much spending and not enough tax  breaks. The final plan was split into 36 percent for tax cuts  and 64 percent in spending and other provisions.      Sen. Lisa Murkowski, delivering the Republicans' radio  address, said Democrats should be mindful that funding spent on  stimulus 'isn't Monopoly money' and it adds to the federal  deficit. 'Much of the spending is wasteful,' she said.      But Oba",

        "Text": "    By Thomas Ferraro and Susan Cornwell      WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama predicted  a 'difficult next few days' as the Democratic-controlled U.S.  Senate on Monday debated an almost $900 billion stimulus package  of federal spending and tax cuts amid Republican opposition.      Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said he hoped to  push the measure through the chamber by Friday after considering a  stack of amendments offered by Republicans as well as members of  his own party.      But Republicans -- who last week withheld support from a  similar measure in the Democratic-controlled House of  Representatives --  appeared ready to fight to put more emphasis  on tax cuts and less on new spending.      'We're not trying to prevent a package from passing. We're  trying to reform it -- reformulate it,' Senate Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell told a Capitol Hill news conference.      McConnell, of Kentucky, said most members of his party  believed the package can be trimmed and should be aimed initially  at easing record home foreclosures, which have largely been blamed  for the deepening recession.      At the White House, Obama told reporters, 'There are still  some differences between Democrats and Republicans ... between  the White House and some of the products that have been  discussed.      'But what we can't do is let various modest differences get in  the way of the overall package moving forward swiftly,' he said.      Obama, who met on Capitol Hill last week with House and Senate  Republicans, planned to confer at the White House later in the day  with congressional Democratic leaders.           LIBERAL WISH LIST?      Many Republicans and some Democrats have complained that a  number of provisions in the package would not stimulate the  economy and are little more than a liberal wish list, such as $50  million to promote the arts and $335 million to educate people  about sexually transmitted diseases.      McConnell said Republicans would seek to help battered  homeowners, key victims in the fiscal downturn.      Republicans will propose providing government-backed home  mortgages at an interest rate of 4 percent to credit-worthy  borrowers, McConnell said.      Obama, in an interview with NBC on late Sunday, said, 'We're  going to be trimming out things that are not relevant to putting  people back to work right now.'      Said McConnell, 'I couldn't agree with that more.'      The Senate bill contains $342 billion in temporary tax  breaks and more than $545 billion in spending to total about  $887 billion.      Spending proposals include measures to upgrade education and  healthcare, bolster energy programs and rebuild crumbling roads  and bridges.      The House passed a somewhat different version last week  without any Republican support. Senate Democrats will need at  least two Republican votes, however, to clear possible procedural  roadblocks.      Once the Senate passes its bill, negotiators from the two  chambers will seek to resolve differences and then send a final  bill to Obama to sign into law. The president has said he wants  such legislation by the middle of the month.      Speaking with reporters at the White House, Obama said he  expected a 'difficult next few days' as the Senate wrangles  over a stimulus bill.      But the president voiced optimism that a final bill could  be crafted within the next few weeks.      'We can put America back to work and start digging  ourselves ou",
