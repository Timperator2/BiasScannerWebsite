        "Text": "Does Michelle Obama dislike America? That is the subject of this evening's \"Talking Points Memo.\"\n\nCampaigning Monday for her husband in Wisconsin, Mrs. Obama said something that has caused major controversy, and she said it twice.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA, BARACK OBAMA'S WIFE: Let me tell you something. For the first time in my adult life, I am proud of my country, because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd let me tell you something. I need to believe that we live in that kind of nation, where hope and possibility and unity is still what drives us.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nNow, the problem with that statement is the words \"for the first time in my adult life I am proud of my country.\" Perhaps Michelle Obama simply misspoke. That happens all the time when you give speeches. But Mrs. Obama said it twice in two different speeches.\n\nNow I'm willing, I'm willing to give Mrs. Obama the benefit of the doubt if she wants that benefit. The problem is she's been silent, letting others speak for her.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDAVID AXELROD, BARACK OBAMA'S CHIEF STRATEGIST: She gives this talk all the time, and I don't think she formulates the words quite that way generally. But if you look at the whole quote and read beyond it, she was plainly talking about this burst of participation, this sense of hope, the sense of possibility and so on. And she was talking about the politics of our country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOK, fine. But again, Michelle Obama should be explaining herself, not paid advisers.\n\nWhy is an explanation needed, you might ask? Well, because most Americans are proud of their country and don't like it see it run down in any way. Michelle Obama is a prominent person. What she says carries weight all over the world. Also, what she says can be used against her.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCINDY MCCAIN, JOHN MCCAIN'S WIFE: I'm proud of my country. I don't know about you, if you heard those words earlier. I'm very proud of my country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWell, the fact that Michelle Obama has not clarified the situation is a major mistake for the Obama campaign.\n\nAgain, I don't believe Michelle Obama dislikes her country. I sincerely hope she does not, but this is a big deal. It is not going away. And the Obama campaign should understand that.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads and Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

        "Text": "Barack Obama\u2019s wife, Michelle, is under fire for leaving the impression that she hasn\u2019t been proud of her country until now, when Democrats are beginning to rally around her husband\u2019s campaign.\n\nSpeaking in Milwaukee, Wis., on Monday, she said, \u201cPeople in this country are ready for change and hungry for a different kind of politics and \u2026 for the first time in my adult life I am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback.\u201d\n\nGreeted with rousing applause after making the comment in Milwaukee, Obama delivered an amended version of the speech later that day in Madison, Wis.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in my adult lifetime, I\u2019m really proud of my country \u2026 not just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry for change,\u201d she said. \u201cI have been desperate to see our country moving in that direction and just not feeling so alone in my frustration and disappointment.\u201d\n\nObama was born in 1964, meaning her adult life began in 1982. Critics quickly seized on the newfound national pride.\n\n\u201cI am proud of my country,\u201d John McCain\u2019s wife, Cindy, said at a campaign stop in Brookfield, Wis., Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you heard those words earlier \u2026 but I am very proud of my country.\u201d\n\nDuring a follow up press conference, the Arizona senator was asked if they were responding to Michelle Obama and he deferred to his wife.\n\nMcCain responded: \u201cI just wanted to make the statement that I have and always will be proud of my country.\u201d\n\nObama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the candidate\u2019s wife wasn\u2019t trying to knock her country, only underscore the meaning behind her husband\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cThe point is that of course Michelle is proud of her country, which is why she and Barack talk constantly about how their story wouldn\u2019t be possible in any other nation on Earth,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat she meant is that she\u2019s really proud at this moment because for the first time in a long time, thousands of Americans who\u2019ve never participated in politics before are coming out in record numbers to build a grassroots movement for change.\u201d\n\nBut conservative outlets aren\u2019t so ready to let her off the hook.\n\n\u201cCan it really be there has not been a moment during that time when she felt proud of her country?\u201d reads an article in Commentary magazine. \u201cForget matters like the victory in the Cold War; how about only things that have made liberals proud \u2014 all the accomplishments of inclusion? How about the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991? Or Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s elevation to the Supreme Court?\u201d\n\nThe article then says Michelle Obama\u2019s comments suggest \u201cthe pseudo-messianic nature of the Obama candidacy is very much a part of the way the Obamas themselves are feeling.\u201d\n\nWeekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol said the comment \u201cwas sort of revealing.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was an adult when we won the Cold War without firing a shot. She was an adult for the last 25 years of economic progress, social progress,\u201d he told FOX News. \u201cI think the Democrats have to be careful \u2026 they\u2019re running against the status quo \u2026 You have to be careful not to let that slide into a kind of indictment of America. Because I don\u2019t think the American people think on the whole that the last 25 years of American history is a narrative of despair and nothing to be proud of.\u201d\n\nDemocratic strategist Bob Beckel said Obama \u201cshouldn\u2019t have said it the way she said it\u201d but she gets the benefit of his doubt. He added that she most likely was just referring to the grassroots movement that\u2019s swelled to support her husband, but she needs to be more careful.\n\n\u201cThe Obama\u2019s have to recognize they are now front-runners, and everything they say, it\u2019s now open hunting season for people,\u201d he said.\n\nClick here to see the video of Michelle Obama talking in Madison about being proud of her country for the first time.\n\nClick here to read the posting on the Commentary Web site.\n\nFOX News\u2019 Mosheh Oinounou and Bonney Kapp contributed to this report.",

        "Text": "    NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama wrote a  thank-you note to Laura Bush after the first lady spoke up in  defense of the wife of the Democratic presidential candidate,  Obama said on Wednesday.      Obama, who is married to Illinois Sen. Barack Obama,  created a controversy on the campaign trail in February when  she said, 'For the first time in my adult lifetime I am really  proud of my country.'      After critics questioned her patriotism because of the  remark, Obama has frequently said she is proud of her country.      During an appearance on ABC Television's 'The View' on  Wednesday, she re-stated her pride in the United States and  said her controversial comment was referring to being proud of  the political process this year.      Laura Bush came to Obama's defense earlier this month,  telling ABC's 'Good Morning America': 'I think she probably  meant, 'I'm more proud.' You have to be very careful in what  you say. Everything you say is looked at and in many cases  misconstrued.'      Obama said she appreciated Bush's comments and concern.      'I was touched by it and actually I sent her a note,' Obama  said on 'The View.' 'It took me a while to write it. Like, how  do I address her? I sent it to 'Madam First Lady.' I don't want  to talk about it because she might not have it yet.      'That's what I like about Laura Bush, her whole rational  approach to these issues. I am taking some cues. There's a  reason why people like her, because she doesn't sort of fuel  the fire.'

        "Text": "    By Matthew Bigg      ATLANTA, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama brings the skills  of a corporate lawyer to the White House as first lady to  President-elect Barack Obama, but she says her priority will be  her role as 'mom-in-chief' to the couple's two daughters.      Democrat Obama beat Republican John McCain in Tuesday's  election. He will be the first black U.S. president and his  wife the first black first lady.      Michelle Obama, 44, was a passionate advocate for her  husband's candidacy, but she says she would not want a direct  policy role in an Obama administration.      'My first job, in all honesty, is going to continue to be  'mom-in-chief,'' she said in a recent magazine interview  referring to daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7.      She also says she hopes to focus ways women maintain a  work-family balance and the needs of military families, and she  could act as an informal adviser to her husband as she has been  during the campaign.      Obama, who grew up in a blue-collar neighborhood on the  south side of Chicago and went to public school, often talks  about her father -- who worked for the city's public water  system -- and the values instilled by her parents.      After winning scholarships to the elite universities of  Princeton and Harvard law school, Obama worked for a law firm  and in the Chicago mayor's office.      Her most recent job was vice president of the University of  Chicago hospitals, where she earned more than her husband. Even  though the Obamas are now well off, partly due to royalties  from Barack Obama's two books, Michelle Obama stresses the  values she learned growing up.      'When you are raised in a home ... (in which) you have love  and security and you have people who are sacrificing for you  ... you have an obligation to give back,' she said. 'That's why  community service has been such a big part of my life.'           'PROUD OF MY COUNTRY'      In his victory speech Tuesday night, Barack Obama described  his wife as 'my best friend for the last 16 years, the rock of  our family, the love of my life.' He says she has been a source  of strength and a gentle critic who keeps him grounded.      Their public displays of affection and her fashion sense --  she has been featured in magazines such as Vogue  and Essence  -- contribute to the candidate's youthful image.      In a widely praised speech at the Democratic National  Convention, Michelle Obama shared details of the couple's life  together and said her husband represented typical American  values.      'What struck me when I first met Barack was that even  though he had this funny name, and even though he'd grown up  all the way across the continent in Hawaii, his family was so  much like mine,' she said.      'He was raised by grandparents who were working-class folks  like my parents, and by a single mother who struggled to pay  the bills just like we did.'      Michelle Obama has receded from the limelight since the  convention, even though she draws large crowds while  campaigning solo for her husband.      She is immensely popular with Democrats who warm to the  strength and smartness she projects, but in February she  stirred controversy with comments she made on the campaign  trail.      'For the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud  of my country,' she told an audience in Wisconsin. 'And not  just because Barack has done well, but because I think people  are hungry for change.'      Conservatives criticized h",

        "Text": "    By Matthew Bigg      ATLANTA, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama will bring the  skills of a corporate lawyer to the White House if her husband  wins the U.S. presidency, but she says her priority will be her  role as 'mom-in-chief' to the couple's daughters.      Democrat Barack Obama faces Republican John McCain in  Tuesday's election. If the first-term Illinois senator wins, he  will become the first black U.S. president and his wife the  first black first lady.      Michelle Obama, 44, is a passionate advocate for her  husband's candidacy, but she says she would not want a direct  policy role in an Obama administration.      'My first job, in all honesty, is going to continue to be  'mom-in-chief,'' she said in a recent magazine interview  refering to daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7.      She also says she hopes to focus ways women maintain a  work-family balance and the needs of military families and she  could act as an informal adviser to her husband as she has been  during the campaign.      Obama, who grew up in a blue-collar neighborhood on the  south side of Chicago and went to public school, often talks  about her father -- who worked for the city's public water  system -- and the values instilled by her parents.      After winning scholarships to the elite universities of  Princeton and Harvard law school, Obama worked for a law firm  and in the Chicago mayor's office.      Her most recent job was vice president of the University of  Chicago hospitals, where she earned more than her husband. Even  though the Obamas are now well off, partly due to royalties  from Barack Obama's two books, Michelle Obama stresses the  values she learned growing up.      'When you are raised in a home ... (in which) you have love  and security and you have people who are sacrificing for you  ... you have an obligation to give back,' she said. 'That's why  community service has been such a big part of my life.'           'PROUD OF MY COUNTRY'      Barack Obama describes his wife as his 'rock,' a source of  strength and a gentle critic who keeps him grounded. Their  public displays of affection and her fashion sense -- she has  been featured in magazines such as Vogue  and Essence --  contribute to the candidate's youthful image.      In a widely praised speech at the Democratic National  Convention, Michelle Obama shared details of the couple's life  together and said her husband represented typical American  values.      'What struck me when I first met Barack was that even  though he had this funny name, and even though he'd grown up  all the way across the continent in Hawaii, his family was so  much like mine,' she said.

'For the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud  of my country,' she told an audience in Wisconsin. 'And not  just because Barack has done well, but because I think people  are hungry for change.'

        "Text": "    WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - Democratic presidential  hopeful Barack Obama said on Monday that Republican critics  should stop picking on his wife Michelle.      'These folks should lay off my wife,' Obama said in an  interview with ABC's 'Good Morning America.'      Obama was referring to a four-minute video posted on  YouTube by the Tennessee Republican Party last week during a  visit by Michelle Obama that portrayed a remark she made in  February in an unflattering manner.      Michelle Obama's remark that 'for first time in my adult  lifetime I'm proud of my country' stirred a controversy at the  time. Critics said it sounded unpatriotic and suggested she had  not been proud of her country before her husband's candidacy.      In the ABC interview, Obama, an Illinois senator and  Democratic front-runner to contest the November election  against Republican John McCain, called the video 'low class'  and said 'most of the American people would think that as  well.'      The Republican video repeatedly showed Michelle Obama  making the proud remark interspersed with comments by  Tennesseans about their own patriotism.      'Whoever is in charge of the Tennessee GOP needs to think  long and hard about the kind of campaign that they want to  run,' Obama said.      Michelle Obama joined her husband in the ABC interview and  said she believed voters were more focused on the issues.      'We are trusting that the American voters are ready to talk  about the issues and not talking about things that have nothing  to do with making people's lives better,' she said.      Obama has not formally won the Democratic presidential  nomination, but he leads against New York Sen. Hillary Clinton  in the pledged delegates to the August party convention that  will pick a candidate to run against McCain, an Arizona  senator. The Democratic candidates face off in primaries in  Oregon and Kentucky on Tuesday, and three more before the party  voting ends on June 3.

        "Text": "    Aug 25 Reuters) - Michelle Obama, wife of Democratic  presidential candidate Barack Obama, will be the featured  speaker at the opening night of the party's nominating  convention on Monday.      Here are some facts about the woman who would be the first  African-American first lady if her husband is elected on Nov.  4:           * Obama, 44, met her husband through her work as a  corporate lawyer and is his closest adviser, although  associates have described her role as less of a policy-oriented  one than that of a confidante who provides a reality check.      * Educated at Princeton and Harvard, Obama was initially  reticent about getting involved in the election campaign, but  now draws large crowds of her own.      * Obama has taken time off from her job as a vice president  of community relations at the University of Chicago Hospitals  to campaign for her husband.      * Her first priority if she becomes first lady would be her  two young daughters, but she would also hope to focus on how  women can maintain a work-family balance.      * Critics seized on her comment that 'For the first time in  my adult life, I am proud of my country' as evidence of a lack  of patriotism, a charge her husband also has faced.      * Known for a sense of style, Obama has appeared in Vogue  and been compared to former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy. She  was widely praised by fashion writers for the violet sheath  dress she wore to her husband's Democratic nomination victory  rally.      * Asked in a CBS interview last week what his wife would  wear for her prime-time television appearance on Monday, Obama  replied: 'You know, there -- there are some things that even I  don't know. And what Michelle is going to wear is a tightly  held secret.'

        "Text": "    By Deborah Charles      WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama's fiery   campaign style belies the fact that she was hesitant at first  about getting involved in her husband Barack's bid to become  U.S. president.      Obama says she never expected to be on stage extolling her  husband's virtues, but she is revving up crowds as she tells  them he is the Democratic candidate who offers the best option  for change in the United States.      'I am very passionate about change in the country and  that's what you see,' the 44-year-old Princeton- and  Harvard-educated lawyer from Chicago told Reuters in an  interview last year.      The woman who would become America's first black first lady  if her husband wins the White House, has taken time off from  her job as a vice president of community relations at the  University of Chicago Hospitals to campaign.      She spends as much time as she can at home with daughters  Malia, 9, and Sasha, 6. She wants their lives to remain as  'normal' as possible, even though she has been hitting the  campaign trail for longer periods of time.      Though she joins her husband, 46, for major rallies, where  she is a popular warm-up act, Michelle Obama has her own  schedule of events -- usually in more intimate settings where  she can meet people and answer questions one-on-one.      'I am really worried that we won't make the right decision  this time around,' she said. 'And I'm really going to put  everything that I have into making sure that people understand  what's at stake and that we are thinking with our heads and not  with fear.'           'LOVE OF MY LIFE'      Barack Obama often speaks about her. In his victory  speeches in recent primaries he has given special thanks to  'the love of my life, the rock of the Obama family, the closer  on the campaign trail.'      In turn, Michelle Obama gets loud cheers when she appears  on stage with her husband, often predicting as she introduces  him: 'He's going to be the best president that we have seen in  a long time.'      Michelle Obama did her undergraduate studies at Princeton  University, where she earned a degree in sociology with a minor  in African-American studies.      She went on to Harvard Law School, then worked in a  corporate law firm in Chicago.      It was there she met Barack in 1988. Although he is three  years older, her husband spent several years working as a  community organizer before going to law school. As a new  lawyer, Michelle was assigned as his adviser.      They began dating soon after and were married in 1992.      Obama regularly says he is lucky his wife never decided to  run for office. In his book 'The Audacity of Hope,' he wrote,  'If I ever had to run against her for public office, she would  beat me without much difficulty.'

        "Text": "    By Jill Serjeant      LOS ANGELES, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Oprah Winfrey wept tears of  joy, Leonardo DiCaprio said he was proud to be an American and  several hip-hop music stars said Sen. Barack Obama's election  as the first black U.S. president fulfilled the dreams of  America's youth.      Celebrities played a large, and sometimes controversial,  role in Obama's election campaign, organizing fund-raisers,  performing at rallies and campaigning on his behalf.      Republican candidate John McCain used Obama's popularity  with actors and musicians during the campaign to mock the  Illinois senator as little more than a celebrity himself.      But when Obama was declared president-elect on Tuesday, his  A-list supporters spoke out again.      DiCaprio, in Rome for the Italian premiere of his movie  'Body of Lies', told reporters on Wednesday he had stayed up  all night watching the election.      'I couldn't be more proud of my country right now and proud  of being an American ... I feel overwhelmed and I feel a  tremendous weight has been lifted from my shoulders,' the  'Titanic' star said.      Talk-show host Winfrey, one of America's most influential   women, campaigned with Obama last year. On Tuesday night,  millions of TV viewers saw her in tears among the tens of  thousands gathered in Chicago for Obama's victory speech.      'It feels like America did the right thing,' Winfrey told  CNN. 'It feels like there's a shift in consciousness. It feels  like something really big and bold has happened here, like  nothing ever in our lifetimes did we expect this to happen.'      Hip-hop music and fashion mogul Russell Simmons said  Obama's election was 'a clear reflection of hip-hop politics.'      'While many older Americans, who marched and struggled so  hard so Senator Obama could run for president of the United  States never dared to believe in his candidacy's real  potential, young people, particularly the hip-hop community,  had faith and their imagination became our reality,' Simmons  said in a statement.           PEOPLE MAGAZINE      R&B singer Usher told Access Hollywood, 'Barack Obama  doesn't represent a color. He represents change.' Black music  producer and singer Sean Diddy Combs said, 'I felt like my vote  was the vote that put him into office ... And that may not be  true but that's how much power it felt like I had.'      People magazine, typically a place to read about Hollywood  stars such as Katie Holmes and Britney Spears, put Obama on its  front cover in a special edition marking his election.      Actor George Clooney said in a statement it was 'time to  begin unifying the country so we can take on the extraordinary  challenges that this generation faces.'      And poet Maya Angelou, 80, author of the influential book  'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings', said she could barely talk  without weeping as she remembered all the African-Americans who  had struggled for civil rights in the past.      'We are growing up. My God, I'm so grateful,' Angelou told  'The Early Show' on CBS.      'We have elected a black man to talk for us, to speak for  us. We, blacks, whites, Asians, Spanish-speaking, Native  Americans, we have done it.'

        "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama graces the  cover of next month's Vogue magazine, marking the second time a  U.S. first lady has appeared on the front of one of the world's  leading fashion magazines.      Obama, 45, who has been hailed by both U.S. retailers and  the media as a new fashion icon, donned a magenta sheath dress  for the cover photo. The dress was designed by Jason Wu, who  also created her white inaugural ball gown.      Famed photographer Annie Leibovitz took the cover photo and  several fashion shots featured inside the March edition of  Vogue.      With the exception of Bess Truman, every U.S. first lady  since Lou Hoover in the 1930s has been featured in Vogue, but  Obama is only the second presidential wife to appear on the  cover, Vogue said. Hillary Clinton did so in 1998.      Obama has won praise from fashionistas for mixing designer  pieces with off-the-rack American brands like J. Crew and Gap.       Vogue's editor-at-large, Andre Leon Talley said Obama  selected the outfits worn for the photo shoot herself, from her  own wardrobe, pairing designer wear with affordable clothes.      'She doesn't need any help. She loves fashion and knows  what works for her. She's never had a conversation with me  about, 'What do you think?' or 'How did this look?' And I'm  glad for that.'       Obama told Vogue she loved clothes, but said comfort and  fun was more important than following fashion.      'First and foremost, I wear what I love. That's what women  have to focus on: what makes them happy and what makes them  feel comfortable and beautiful. If I can have any impact, I  want women to feel good about themselves and have fun with  fashion,' she said.      While Obama discussed her views on fashion, she made clear  family was her first priority, particularly caring for  daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7.      'I'm going to try to take them to school every morning, as  much as I can,' Obama told the magazine. 'But there's also a  measure of independence. And obviously there will be times I  won't be able to drop them off at all. I like to be a presence  in my kids' school. I want to know the teachers; I want to know  the other parents,' she said.

Chairman Howard Dean pounded a gavel to start the four-day  convention where Democrats say their presidential candidate  must unite the party, get tough on Republican rival John McCain  and back up soaring oratory with specific policies.       The aim of the first day was to frame Obama's personal  story, the son of a black man from Kenya and white woman from  Kansas who spent his early years in Hawaii and Indonesia,  worked his way through college and began his political career  as a community organizer in Chicago.       His wife, Michelle Obama, headlined the opening night. In  front of a huge crowd waving 'Michelle' signs, she said her  husband represented typical American values, rejecting  Republican charges that Obama is an aloof celebrity.      'What struck me when I first met Barack was that even  though he had this funny name, and even though he'd grown up  all the way across the continent in Hawaii, his family was so  much like mine,' she said.      'He was raised by grandparents who were working class folks  just like my parents, and by a single mother who struggled to  pay the bills just like we did,' she said.       Michelle Obama also put a gloss on her own assertive  personality. She has drawn fire from Republicans for saying she  only recently became proud of her country.      'I come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he  will be an extraordinary president. I come here as a mom whose  girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world,'  she said.      After she spoke, Obama himself appeared for the first time  to the convention, showing up on a large video screen to praise  his wife as she stood on stage with their two young daughters,  Malia and Sasha.      'Malia, Sasha, how did you think Mom did?' said Obama, who  spoke from Kansas City.      'I think she did good,' was the reply.      Speaking to reporters in Illinois, the first-term senator  tried to calm anxiety among some Democrats about a mild slide  in opinion polls that has left him in a dead heat with McCain  heading toward the Nov. 4 election.      He said his nomination acceptance speech on Thursday would  be 'workmanlike,' short on lofty words and long on policy  details.      He also played down divisions with the Clintons, Hillary  and Bill, the former president still stewing over having been  accused by Obama of trying to inject racial politics into the  Democrats' primary battle earlier this year.      'I am absolutely convinced that both Hillary Clinton and  Bill Clinton understand the stakes,' Obama told reporters in  Moline, Illinois.      In her speech, Michelle Obama praised Clinton for seeking  to advance the cause of American women 'so that our daughters  and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher.'      In an emotional high point, Massachusetts Sen. Edward  Kennedy, 76, a symbol of Democratic liberalism who is battling  brain cancer, appeared before the cheering crowd after a  videotaped tribute to his long political life.      'My fellow Americans, it is so wonderful to be here,' said ",

        "Text": "    By Martinne Geller      NEW YORK, Feb 16 (Reuters) - First lady Michelle Obama is  widely hailed as a fashion icon, but industry insiders say  she's quite the opposite, and that's a good thing.      A fashion icon would have an eye-catching signature look  and, while the president's wife has the power to set trends,  her appeal is refreshingly not so defined and deliberate, said  fashion observers at the semi-annual Fashion Week in New York,  where designers are showing their Fall 2009 collections.      Michelle Obama 'is more real than iconic,' said David  Wolfe, creative director of the Doneger Group, which forecasts  trends. 'She doesn't have a locked-in fashion look. She  experiments, which is what fashion is about these days.'      References to Obama, 45, as an icon of fashion are  everywhere. Thin and statuesque, the attorney and mother of two  graces the cover of Vogue magazine's March issue.      She wins lavish attention from designers, editors and  stylists. Stores quickly sell out of the clothes she wears.      While Obama's style merits praise, she is not in the ranks  of such icons as actress Katharine Hepburn, with her tailored  menswear, or Jacqueline Kennedy with her pillbox hats and  wide-frame sunglasses, said Helen Job, a trend forecaster with  WGSN, a fashion research and analysis firm.      'When you think about a fashion icon, it's somebody who has  this ability to influence the public to such a degree ... to  change the direction (a style) is going in,' she said.      Kennedy's sense of style would be out of place among women  today, said Wolfe.      'Jackie Kennedy was locked into the Jackie Kennedy look and  never stepped out of it. That was great, but it certainly isn't  the way modern women dress,' he said.      Obama wears clothes by little-known designers and  mid-priced chains such as J Crew Group Inc <JCG.N>, helping  dispose of the idea that first ladies always must look formal.      'She's really set this new guideline, and I feel like the  White House will never be the same after this somehow,' said  Gloria Baume, fashion director for Teen Vogue.         DEMOCRATIC FASHION     Jason Wu, the young designer of Obama's white inaugural gown  and the magenta dress she wears in Vogue, credits the first  lady with reinvigorating the industry.     'In her own way, she is like a stimulus package for the  fashion industry,' Wu said.      Few first ladies deserved the title as fashion icons, said  Mandi Norwood, a former magazine editor writing a book on  Obama's style.      'We've been trying desperately to promote the first lady  into fashion icon status, but I'm not sure any of them have  truly deserved that title,' she said.      Obama does have some company in U.S. history, said Lisa  Kathleen Graddy, curator of 'The First Ladies at the  Smithsonian' exhibit.      Frances Cleveland's clothes and hairstyle were copied and  commented upon, and advertisers used her to sell products she  had never seen or used. The Victorian-era bustle even fell out  of U.S. fashion when it was reported she would no longer wear  the rear-enhancing gowns.      Another fashionable first lady was Grace Coolidge, who is  considered to have popularized fashion, said Graddy.      Grover Cleveland was president in the late 1800s. Calvin  Coolidge served in the 1920s.

        "Text": "  (Recasts with details of inaugural ball dress, new quotes)      By Jill Serjeant      LOS ANGELES, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama officially  entered the world stage on Tuesday in outfits by U.S. designers  paired with off-the-rack accessories, mixing glamour with  practicality.      The first lady chose a sparkling sheath dress and matching  coat in yellow-gold by Cuban-born designer Isabel Toledo for  the swearing-in ceremony but added olive green gloves from  chain store J.Crew and Jimmy Choo shoes.      For the inaugural balls, she wore a white, one-shouldered  chiffon gown with a full skirt by Taiwan-born U.S. designer  Jason Wu, 26, whose dresses cost up to $6,000.      'How good looking is my wife?,' President Barack Obama  asked the crowd at the first of 10 inaugural balls attended by  the couple.      Michelle Obama's clothing choices were expected to provide  clues to the way she will undertake her role as first lady in a  time of deep recession.      A former lawyer, Michelle Obama, 45, has won kudos for her  chic, youthful style, mixing chain store garments with edgy  designers like Chicago's Mario Pinto and Narciso Rodriguez.      Her daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, both wore J. Crew  coats to the presidential swearing-in ceremony.      Obama won praise in June by wearing a $148 black and white  off-the-rack dress for appearing on the TV chat show 'The  View.' It sold out nationwide overnight.      Her yellow swearing-in outfit was a departure from red,  white or blue tones often adopted by U.S. female politicians  and spouses. Yellow is seen in many parts of the world as a  symbol of hope and optimism.           'RADIATED HOPE AND OPTIMISM'      But Obama's choice did not get universal approval. An  online poll on the Us Weekly celebrity magazine site showed 55  percent of readers hated the outfit and 44 percent loved it.      Bonnie Fuller, former editor in chief of Glamour magazine,  called the outfit bold but wondered on www.huffingtonpost.com:  'Is she walking around in inaugural upholstery?'       New York-based designer Toledo, 47, said the coat and  dress were made of Swiss wool lace, backed with netting for  warmth and lined in French silk.      'For me yellow represents hope,' Toledo told Reuters. 'It  really feels like freshness to me. I wanted to capture  optimism, I wanted it to feel happy, I wanted it to feel  inclusive.'      Her ball gown, which will go on show at the Smithsonian,  received a mixed reaction with U.S. fashion bible Women's Wear  Daily saying it made the Obamas look like newlyweds.      'But Michelle Obama is rewriting the fashion rules and she  looks every inch the style icon she is becoming,' wrote the Los  Angeles Times.      In hard times, fashion commentators expected Obama to avoid  anything too glitzy or frivolous. But dressing down too much  could have attracted as much criticism as extravagance.      Former first lady Rosalynn Carter was criticized during the  1970s oil crisis for wearing her previously worn, off-the-rack  gown to the 1977 inaugural ball.      In 1981, Nancy Reagan was deemed 'too Hollywood' with her  white, one-shoulder, lace satin sheath with crystal beads.      Obama is already considered an ambassador for American  fashion. She was listed in Vanity Fair's magazine's '10 of the  World's Best Dressed People' in both 2007 and 2008 and has  drawn numerous comparisons with Jacqueline Kennedy.

        "Text": "    * Obama promises 'workmanlike' acceptance speech      * Michelle Obama disputes elitist charge      * Edward Kennedy speech sets off celebration           By Steve Holland,      DENVER, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Democrats opening their national  convention tried to heal a rift with Hillary Clinton's  resentful supporters on Monday and portrayed Barack Obama as a  down-to-earth American patriot bidding to make history.       Chairman Howard Dean pounded a gavel to start the four-day  convention where Democrats say their presidential candidate  must unite the party, get tough on Republican rival John McCain  and back up soaring oratory with specific policies.      The aim of the first day was to frame Obama's personal  story and the keynote speaker was his wife, Michelle Obama. In  excerpts from her prepared remarks, she seemed to want to  dispel Republican charges that Obama is an aloof celebrity.      'And in the end, after all that's happened these past 19  months, the Barack Obama I know today is the same man I fell in  love with 19 years ago,' she said.      Michelle Obama also put a gloss on her own assertive  personality. She has drawn fire from Republicans for saying she  only recently became proud of her country.      'I come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he  will be an extraordinary president. I come here as a mom whose  girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world,'  she said.      Speaking to reporters in Illinois, the first-term senator  tried to calm anxiety among some Democrats about a mild slide  in opinion polls that has left him in a dead heat with McCain  heading toward the Nov. 4 election.      He said his nomination acceptance speech on Thursday would  be 'workmanlike,' short on lofty words and long on policy  details.      He also played down divisions with the Clintons, Hillary  and Bill, the former president still stewing over having been  accused by Obama of trying to inject racial politics into the  Democrats' primary battle earlier this year.      'I am absolutely convinced that both Hillary Clinton and  Bill Clinton understand the stakes,' Obama told reporters in  Moline, Illinois.      In an emotional high point, Massachusetts Sen. Edward  Kennedy, 76, a symbol of Democratic liberalism who is battling  brain cancer, appeared before the cheering crowd after a  videotaped tribute to his long political life.      'My fellow Americans, it is so wonderful to be here,' said  Kennedy. 'And nothing -- nothing -- is going to keep me away  from this special gathering tonight.'      Casting a cloud over the convention was ongoing resentment  from supporters of New York Sen. Clinton, miffed that she lost  the nomination and upset that she was not picked as Obama's  vice presidential running mate. Obama chose veteran Delaware  Sen. Joe Biden, who arrived at the convention on Monday.      Clinton, speaking to sign-waving supporters from her home  state delegation before the convention began, urged party  unity.      'We are after all Democrats, so it may take a while,' she  said. 'We're not the fall-in-line party. We are diverse. But  make no mistake, we are unified,' she said.           ASSAULT ON MCCAIN BEGINS      Speakers began an assault on McCain, charging him with  wanting to maintain policies of unpopular President George W.  Bush.      'Republicans say that John McCain has experience,' said  House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 'We say that  John McCain has the experience of ",

        "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Feb 25 (Reuters Life!) - Few things are as  sweet to a parent as family meals and bedtime with the kids,  and those are two reasons Michelle Obama says her new life at  the White House is comforting.      Well, those and a little exercise.      In an interview for the March 9 issue of People magazine,  the First Lady reveals some details of her family life in the  month since President Barack Obama was inaugurated, and they  moved their daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7 into 1600  Pennsylvania Ave. in Washington, D.C.      After more than a year living out of suitcases and in hotel  rooms on the campaign trail, Michelle Obama says the family now  has dinner together every night, where they talk about the  highs and lows of their day. Later the president is able to  tuck his children into bed before they drift off to sleep.      'We haven't had that kind of time together for (years), so  that explains a lot why we all feel so good in this space,' the  First Lady told People magazine.      Among their daily routine is exercise for her and her  husband at 5:30 in the morning and breakfast together before  their respective days begin. She said the secrets to their  successful marriage include being able to laugh together and  his ability to stay calm under stress.      But she stopped well short of saying they are a model of  married perfection. 'I don't want anybody to think it's easy.  It works because we really work at it ... We have a strong  marriage, but it's not perfect.'      She did say her husband has quit smoking, for now, and that  Malia and Sasha must still do their chores -- make their beds,  clean their rooms and clear the dishes from the dinner table.      'People (here) want to make your life easy, and when you  have small kids -- I've explained this to the staff -- they  don't need their lives to be easy. They're kids,' she said.      And what about the president's promise to get a dog for the  girls? The First Lady said it is on the way, but is waiting  until April, after the girls have had their spring break from  school. But she has a problem -- the name.      The girls have come up with several ideas, including Frank  and Moose, but mom Obama is not going for those. 'I'm like, no.  Come on. Let's work with the names a little bit,' she said.

        "Text": "    By Caren Bohan      WASHINGTON, June 10 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama and Cindy  McCain share a dislike of rough-edged U.S. politics. Each tried  to talk her spouse out of running for the White House.      Obama, wife of Democratic candidate Barack Obama, and  McCain, who is married to Republican John McCain, are both  known for an elegant sense of style, lending glamour to their  husbands' campaigns.      McCain posed in size zero jeans for the latest issue of  Vogue. Obama, who has also appeared in the fashion magazine,  was praised by style writers for the violet sheath dress she  wore to her husband's Democratic nomination victory rally and  has been compared to former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy.      But the aspiring first ladies have plenty of differences.      Obama, 44, is a Princeton- and Harvard-educated lawyer  raised by blue-collar parents on the working-class South Side  of Chicago. She would be the first African American U.S. first  lady.      Obama talks often on the campaign trail about being a  working mother. Until recently, she juggled a job as a hospital  executive with raising two young daughters and lending support  to her 46-year-old husband's political aspirations.      The strong-minded Obama exudes confidence and is an  accomplished public speaker. But her penchant for outspokenness  has also drawn some criticism.      McCain, 54, the Arizona senator's second wife, is reserved  and seems far less comfortable in the limelight when she  campaigns with her husband, who is 18 years her senior.           RODEO QUEEN      The blond, blue-eyed McCain is a former rodeo queen and  cheerleader who holds a master's degree in special education  from the University of Southern California. She grew up in a  wealthy family in Phoenix and is heiress to Hensley & Co, one  of the largest U.S. distributors for brewing giant  Anheuser-Busch.      Last month, she released a tax return showing she made  about $6 million in 2006.      McCain has raised four children, including a daughter  Bridget, 16, whom she adopted from Mother Teresa's orphanage in  Bangladesh. McCain has traveled the globe as part of her  charitable work.      McCain's deferential manner puts her in the company of more  traditional first ladies such as Nancy Reagan and Laura Bush.      'She is more in the classic mold of the candidate's wife on  the campaign trail,' said Calvin Jillson, a political scientist  at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.      He said McCain has her own version of the 'Nancy Reagan  stare,' the adoring gaze that the former first lady perfected.      'If you look at Michelle Obama, it appears that throughout  their married life, she and her husband have been very much  equals,' Jillson said. Her image as an equal partner was on  display with the celebratory fist-bump the Obamas shared on the  night he clinched the nomination last week.      America has had nontraditional first ladies before. They  included Rosalynn Carter, wife of Jimmy Carter who sat in on  Cabinet meetings, and Hillary Clinton, who was named by her  husband to lead a health-care task force.      Obama met her husband through her work as a corporate  lawyer and is his closest adviser, although associates have  described her role as less of a policy-oriented one than that  of a confidante who provides a reality check.      She has acquired an image as a tough-minded task-master.      In a favorite line on the campaign trail, the Illinois  senator says his wife of",
