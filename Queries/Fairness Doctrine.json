        "Text": "The trouble begins\u2026 now! Does John's My Word make your blood boil? Click here to listen live to The John Gibson Show on FOX News Radio (weekdays, 6-9 p.m. ET). It's your chance to call in and argue with John!\n\nToday John Kerry weighed in on an issue that is now all the rage among liberal politicians. The issue is called the Fairness Doctrine.\n\nThis is a rule that used to exist in broadcasting \u2014 radio and TV \u2014 which required that no opinion could be expressed without a countervailing opinion presented immediately. It was the old salt and pepper rule. If you were on the air with a salt shaker, you had to have a pepper shaker.\n\nNow what this is all about is talk radio. Liberals are complaining that their brand of talk radio fails whenever someone tries to put it on the air, and they have decided the answer is to shut up conservative talk radio. This is the \"Hush Rush\" movement.\n\nLiberals are angry that so many of you listen to talk radio \u2014 conservative talk radio \u2014 and that you cannot be dragged over to a liberal talk show. This argument ignores the fact that something like 20 million people a week listen to NPR, which is the very definition of liberal.\n\nWhat it also ignores is that the Fairness Doctrine applies to all broadcast, not just radio and especially not just talk radio. Liberals should be on notice it will apply to all the liberals who now operate on the airwaves in network TV news, in certain quarters of cable news and, of course, in entertainment TV.\n\nFace it. Liberals own Hollywood. Virtually every movie would be subject to the Fairness Doctrine. Think Al Gore's \"Inconvenient Truth\" could stand up to that scrutiny or Michael Moore's \"Fahrenheit 9/11\"? Not a chance.\n\nDo you think HBO can stand to have the Fairness Doctrine applied to what it airs? Bill Maher is going to have an awful time trying to conform to the Fairness Doctrine, and I can't think of a liberal anywhere who wants to shut him up.\n\nWhat John Kerry and Dianne Feinstein and Dick Durbin are asking for is to only restrict the broadcasting that conservatives do, mainly talk radio, though I have no doubt they have their plans for FOX News, too.\n\nThis is an attempt to take over the airwaves with liberal thought and make sure nothing else gets on. It's already a huge imbalance in favor of liberal thought on the airwaves, and the effort now is to make certain that echo chamber of so-called progressives is undisturbed by any irritating arguments from the right, or debates liberals can't win.\n\nThis is liberals in action. When you can't win the debate, make certain there is no debate. That is what the resurgence of the Fairness Doctrine debate is all about.\n\nThat's My Word.\n\nWatch John Gibson weekdays at 5 p.m. ET on \"The Big Story\" and send your comments to: myword@foxnews.com\n\nRead Your Word",

        "Text": "    By Kim Dixon      WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate passed an  amendment on Thursday that would bar regulators from requiring  broadcasters to give equal time to all points of view, a ban  strongly supported by some Republican lawmakers.      The legislative amendment, sponsored by Republican Sen. Jim  DeMint of South Carolina, would prevent the Federal  Communications Commission from reimposing the so-called  Fairness Doctrine to all broadcasters. It was repealed more  than 20 years ago.      Aides to President Barack Obama have said he has no  intention of trying to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine, but  that has not stopped some Republicans from raising the issue.      Free Press, a media advocacy group that opposes bringing  back the rule, said the issue was a distraction.      'An uncharitable interpretation is that they (Republicans)  need an issue that unites their base and is an easy talking  point for conservative radio,' said Ben Scott, policy director  at Free Press.      Conservative talk show icon Rush Limbaugh recently decried  the doctrine in a Wall Street Journal editorial.      DeMint said the doctrine violates the First Amendment and  would suppress free speech by letting the government decide  what is fair political dialogue.      An appeals court made that ruling, leading the FCC to  repeal it in 1987.      Scott's group agrees the government should not be decided  what is fair and balanced, but said there is no clamor to bring  it back.      The amendment was attached to an unrelated bill on voting  rights for Washington, D.C. residents. Whether it will survive  in the U.S. House of Representatives is uncertain.

        "Text": "First radio, now the Web?\n\nMedia analysts and bloggers are warning that fresh efforts to bring back the so-called Fairness Doctrine could go too far, following a report that one prominent Democrat is looking into ways to apply the media control standards to the Internet.\n\nThe Fairness Doctrine is a policy created decades ago but abolished in the late 1980s that required broadcasters to provide opposing views on controversial issues.\n\nWhile some Democrats have talked about reviving the policy, The American Spectator reported Monday that Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., is taking the call to a new level. The article said aides to the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee met last week with Federal Communications Commission staff to discuss ways to not only enact those policies but give Waxman's panel greater oversight over the Internet.\n\n\"It's all about diversity in media,\" the Spectator quoted a House energy committee staff member as saying. \"Does one radio station or one station group control four of the five most powerful outlets in one community? ... Does one heavily trafficked Internet site present one side of an issue and not link to sites that present alternative views?\"\n\nThe committee vigorously denied the report. A spokesperson called the account \"fictitious\" in a statement to FOX News.\n\n\"The American Spectator report is false and was written without any documentation or attribution,\" the statement said.\n\nFCC spokesman David Fiske also disputed the claims in the piece, saying, \"We're not sure that it's an accurate article.\"\n\nAnalysts treated the report with a dose of skepticism as well -- but noted that the idea is not entirely foreign. Robert McDowell, the current FCC commissioner and a Bush appointee, warned in an interview last year that Fairness Doctrine advocates might try to extend their policies to the Web.\n\nIf that is the case, foes and supporters of the doctrine alike say policing fairness on the Internet will prove impossible. Plus they say it's unnecessary and well beyond the scope of the original policy.\n\n\"This borders between stupidity and sheer insanity,\" said conservative radio talk show host Mike Gallagher, when told about the Spectator report. \"I can't wait until they try to monitor how many conservative posts are on a thread versus how many liberal posts are on a thread.\"\n\nHe added that Democrats would be only neutralizing dominant liberal blogs that currently help them. He predicted any move to extend Fairness Doctrine principles to the Web would \"blow sky high.\"\n\nThe Fairness Doctrine was adopted in 1949 and held that broadcasters were obligated to provide opposing points of views on controversial issues of national importance. It was halted under the Reagan administration.\n\nThe policy is the scourge of conservative radio hosts, who say it would allow the federal government to skew content on their programs. Democratic lawmakers, some of whom have renewed the call to reinstate the doctrine in recent weeks, say it would bring accountability to the airwaves and help increase the number of liberal shows in a landscape dominated by conservatives like Rush Limbaugh.\n\nSteve Rendall, a Fairness Doctrine supporter and senior analyst with Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, said liberals and conservatives both over-state the impact the doctrine would have on media content.\n\nHe said most talk shows, even those on the right, already comply with the requirements, which he said tread \"very lightly\" and do not call for absolute balance on the airwaves.\n\nBut he said there is \"no justification\" for applying the doctrine to the Internet, or any other form of media -- since the doctrine was only meant to apply standards to the privileged holders of limited broadcast licenses. The Internet, by contrast, has infinite outlets for opinion.\n\n\"Cable and Internet are, at least theoretically, limitless in the number of voices that they can present, and it's not at all the same as broadcast,\" Rendall said.\n\nBrent Bozell, president of the conservative Media Research Center, said it would be \"impossible\" to regulate balance and neutrality on the Internet. He said he thinks Democrats eventually want to bring those standards to the Web but are struggling to rally the political will to revisit the Fairness Doctrine.\n\nHe said any legislative efforts to reinstate it will probably occur behind closed doors, since doing it out in the open could cause political repercussions.\n\nThe Spectator reported that Waxman's advisers were discussing ways to implement Fairness Doctrine policies without actually calling it the \"Fairness Doctrine.\"\n\nOther Democrats have openly called for a modern-day Fairness Doctrine in recent weeks, though they were referring more to radio than the Internet.\n\n\"I absolutely think it's time to be bringing accountability to the airwaves,\" Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., told liberal radio host Bill Press two weeks ago. She said she expects hearings soon on reviving the policy, though her office has reportedly backed off that prediction. (Stabenow's husband, Tom Athans, is and has been an executive at several liberal radio talk groups.)\n\nAnd Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, told Press last week: \"We gotta get the Fairness Doctrine back in law again.\"\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, a spokesman said then-candidate Barack Obama did not favor reinstating the Fairness Doctrine. But Obama's White House aides are now leaving open the question.\n\nAsked if the White House would rule out imposing the doctrine on \"FOX News Sunday,\" senior adviser David Axelrod ducked.\n\n\"I'm going to leave that issue to Julius Genachowski, our new head of the FCC ... and the president to discuss. So I don't have an answer for you now,\" he said.\n\nDespite the speculation, nobody has introduced a bill this session to reinstate those policies.\n\nMeanwhile, Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe introduced a bill this year to prevent reinstatement of the Fairness Doctrine.\n\nFOXNews.com's Judson Berger and FOX News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",

        "Text": "    By Paul Taylor, European Affairs Editor      BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - As the Soviet empire began to  crumble in 1989, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's spokesman  coined the phrase 'the Sinatra doctrine' to describe the process  of each nation going its own way.      'The days of the Brezhnev doctrine are over,' Gennady  Gerassimov said, referring to former leader Leonid Brezhnev's  iron rule that no communist state could leave the fold. 'We now  follow the Frank Sinatra doctrine: I'll do it my way.'      The European Union has struggled to overcome an outbreak of  the 'Sinatra doctrine' since the global financial crisis swept  into Europe from the United States last month, felling giant  banks, rattling markets and panicking savers.      Each country began by acting for itself, some taking  measures with negative consequences for neighbours or partners.      The Irish enacted an unlimited guarantee for deposits in  Irish-owned banks, sucking cash away from British rivals.  National regulators and governments in various countries banned  some or all short-selling of shares.      The Dutch and Italians called for a U.S.-style bank rescue  fund for Europe. France canvassed the idea privately, then  disowned it when Germany objected loudly.      French President Nicolas Sarkozy, holder of the 27-nation  bloc's revolving presidency, tried to assert leadership,  convening a summit of leaders of the major European economies  and EU institutions who pledged to coordinate their response.      That irked smaller EU states which felt excluded without  immediately instilling much more discipline.      The very next day, German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a  blanket guarantee of savers' deposits apparently without having  informed EU partners or the European Commission in advance.            RENATIONALISATION?      By this week, European Commission President Jose Manuel  Barroso was warning: 'A succession of national responses may  cause the renationalisation of the European financial system,  which would be a setback for European integration.'      He rejected accusations that the Commission, seen by some  critics as a slave to free-market dogma, had failed to press for  greater European regulation of banks and markets.      'We all know that before this crisis there was no chance to  introduce more European regulation. Some of the most relevant  member states in economic and financial dimension would not ever  have accepted it,' he told the Friends of Europe think-tank.      Behind the finger-pointing is fear in Brussels of a rise of  protectionism and disregard for EU competition rules that could  wreak economic damage and lead to big gains for Eurosceptics in  next year's European Parliament elections.      Another casualty could be governments' willingness to adopt  ambitious but initially costly measures to fight climate change  and promote renewable energy, due to be enacted this year.      Public anger at bankers' excesses and fear for savings, jobs  and pensions may fuel support for the anti-globalisation left  and the nationalist right, while disenchanted mainstream voters  stay home.      'No' votes in 2005 to the EU constitution in France and the  Netherlands, and Ireland's rejection this year of the Lisbon  treaty containing the same reforms were warning signs.      'We will have a very, very tough election campaign because  the Eurosceptics ... are coming together. From Ireland to  Denmark, Austria and other countries,' ",

        "Text": "    LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Canadian journalist Naomi Klein  has won Britain's inaugural Warwick Prize for Writing for 'The  Shock Doctrine', her acclaimed investigation into neoliberal  economics which she calls 'disaster capitalism'.      The 2007 book argues that governments and companies use  natural disasters like the Asian tsunami or man-made shocks like  the Iraq war or the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, to push through  corporate-friendly policies.      'The Shock Doctrine is a brilliant, provocative,  outstandingly written investigation into some of the great  outrages of our time,' said fantasy fiction author China  Mieville who chaired the judging panel.      Klein receives 50,000 pounds ($73,000) for winning the  biennial award, which is funded by the University of Warwick and  honours any 'substantial' piece of writing in the English  language, including works in translation.      'At a time when the news out of the publishing industry is  usually so bleak, it's thrilling to be part of a bold new prize  supporting writing, especially alongside such an exciting array  of other books,' Klein said in a statement.      Klein was up against 'Montano's Malady' by Spanish writer  Enrique Vila-Matas, Polish-born Lisa Appignanesi for 'Mad, Bad,  and Sad: A History of Women and the Mind Doctors from 1800' and  U.S. novelist Francisco Goldman for 'The Art of Political  Murder: Who Killed Bishop Gerardi?'.      Rounding off the shortlist of six were U.S. theoretical  biologist Stuart Kauffman ('Reinventing the Sacred: A New View  of Science, Reason, and Religion') and U.S. music critic Alex  Ross ('The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century').

        "Text": "    NEW DELHI, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The son of a wealthy Indian  arms dealer, whose drunken driving killed six people a decade  ago, was jailed for five years on Friday in a case seen as a test  of Indian courts' fairness in judging the rich and powerful.      Sanjeev Nanda, the grandson of a former navy chief, pleaded  innocent in the case that saw the convict's family being accused  of trying to bribe witnesses into lying.      The media kept up pressure on the high-profile case in a  country where the judiciary is often accused of favouring the  wealthy and powerful.      'I found Sanjeev Nanda guilty,' judge Vinod Kumar said,  sentencing him to five years in prison.      The court also jailed three other defendants for six months  to a year on charges of destroying evidence in the case which  came to be known as the BMW case after the car Nanda was driving.      Nanda's lawyer said they would appeal before a higher court  within a week.      Prosecutors said Nanda, who was a student of the Wharton  School of Business and on holiday in India, was returning from a  party with two friends when he ran over seven people. Six,  including three policemen, were killed.   (Reporting by R.

        "Text": "    TEHRAN, Nov 21 (Reuters) - The head of the U.N. nuclear  watchdog Mohamed ElBaradei should report on Iran's nuclear  programme neutrally and with fairness, an influential cleric  said on Friday after this week's report on Iran's atomic work.      Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, also a former president, said in a  sermon to worshippers at Friday prayers broadcast on state radio  that U.S. accusations that Iran was diverting its nuclear  programme to military purposes were not backed up by evidence.      Washington and its allies accuse Tehran of seeking to build  nuclear warheads under cover of a civilian atomic programme, a  charge Iran denies, insisting its aim is to generate electricity  so it can save more of its vast oil and gas reserves for export.      'We have announced everything. The (International Atomic  Energy) Agency (IAEA) has acknowledged ... that we have had no  diversion,' Rafsanjani said.      'But the Americans have raised a claim that we are not  announcing everything. Well, a claim of this nature has no  limits in scope and anybody can make such a claim in relation to  anything. They are not giving any document to support their  claim.'      The IAEA presented its latest report on Iran on Wednesday,  saying the Islamic Republic planned to start installing another  3,000 centrifuges early next year, adding to 3,800 already  enriching uranium and another 2,200 being gradually introduced.      The West worries about the enrichment programme because it  can have both civilian and military uses.       'As for Mr ElBaradei, whenever he speaks he does it  equivocally ... (saying) that, for instance, Iran is not letting  the agency inspect the Arak heavy water facility,' he said,  referring to one of Iran's disputed nuclear sites.      'This is again an example of trying to use compulsion in  relations to us. We ask the agency to judge neutrally and fairly  and avoid speaking equivocally,' the former president said.      'We will not let the certain right of a revolutionary and  innocent nation be trampled,' Rafsanjani added.      The IAEA has been investigating allegations that Iran  carried out research into nuclear warheads. The accusations were  based on intelligence which came from a laptop computer spirited  out of Iran by a defector in 2004 and passed on to Washington,  from some other Western states, and from IAEA inquiries.      Iran dismisses the allegations and says U.N. inspectors have  access in line with legal requirements to verify what it says is  the peaceful nature of the Islamic Republic's plans.

        "Text": "     Sept 12 (Reuters) - Republican vice presidential candidate  Sarah Palin, a little-known Alaska governor before becoming  John McCain's running mate in the Nov. 4 U.S. presidential  election, has begun to outline her foreign policy views.      Following are some of the positions she took in a series of  interviews with ABC News this week.           * On Iran and Israel:      'I believe that under the leadership of (Iranian President  Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad, nuclear weapons in the hands of his  government are extremely dangerous to everyone on this globe,  yes.'      'We have got to make sure that these weapons of mass  destruction, that nuclear weapons are not given to those hands  of Ahmadinejad, not that he would use them, but that he would  allow terrorists to be able to use them. So we have got to put  the pressure on Iran and we have got to count on our allies to  help us, diplomatic pressure.'      Asked whether it would be acceptable for Israel, if it felt  threatened, to take military action against Iran's nuclear  facilities, Palin said: 'We cannot second-guess the steps that  Israel has to take to defend itself.'           * On the 'Bush doctrine':      Asked if she agreed with the 'Bush doctrine,' Palin paused  and then asked, 'In what respect?'      Asked what she interpreted the Bush doctrine to be, she  replied, 'His world view.'      When the interviewer explained he was referring to the  doctrine Bush enunciated in September 2002 before the Iraq war,  Palin said:      'I believe that what President Bush has attempted to do is  rid this world of Islamic extremism, terrorists who are hell  bent on destroying our nation.'      When the interviewer defined the doctrine as U.S. President  George W. Bush's belief the United States has a right to make  pre-emptive strikes against countries that may attack it, Palin  said: 'If there is legitimate and enough intelligence that  tells us that a strike is imminent against American people, we  have every right to defend our country. In fact, the president  has the obligation, the duty to defend.'           * On the pursuit of al Qaeda/Taliban into Pakistan:      Asked if the United States had the right to make  cross-border attacks into Pakistan from Afghanistan without the  approval of the Pakistani government, Palin said:      'As for our right to invade, we're going to work with these  countries, building new relationships, working with existing  allies, but forging new, also, in order to, Charlie, get to a  point in this world where war is not going to be a first  option. In fact, war has got to be, a military strike, a last  option.'           * Pressed on whether the United States had the right to  make such cross-border attacks without approval, Palin said:      'In order to stop Islamic extremists, those terrorists who  would seek to destroy America and our allies, we must do  whatever it takes and we must not blink.'      'I believe that America has to exercise all options in  order to stop the terrorists who are hell-bent on destroying  America and our allies. We have got to have all options out  there on the table.'           * On the Russia-Georgia war:      Asked if the United States should try to restore Georgian  sovereignty over South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Palin said:      'We're going to continue good relations with (Georgian  President Mikheil) Saakashvili there. I was able to speak with  him the other day and giving him my commitment, as John  McCain's running ma",

        "Text": "    By Felix Onuah      ABUJA, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Most Nigerians question whether  the country can hold free and fair elections in an atmosphere of  political violence, vote-rigging and lax federal oversight, the  head of the election reform panel said on Tuesday.      Muhammadu Uwais, a former chief justice, said the government  must do more to ensure electoral bodies are independent enough  to conduct federal and state elections.      'Nigerians now express deep frustration over the lack of  credibility of the electoral process and their inability to  elect leaders of their choice,' he said after a meeting with  President Umaru Yar'Adua.      Yar'Adua, whose own electoral victory more than a year ago  is being challenged in court over alleged fraud, set up an  election reform panel in August 2007 shortly after he took  office.      The 21-member committee was charged with providing a report  to Yar'Adua by the end of August, but the president extended the  deadline on Tuesday to the end of the year.      The panel requested more time to digest all the suggestions  from public hearings on how to improve the electoral process.      Nigeria, a country of 140 million people and Africa's  biggest oil producer, returned to civilian rule in 1999 after  three decades of almost continuous military dictatorship.      Uwais said the committee would recommend that elections be  raised to international standards, the electoral body be made  autonomous, and the performance of political parties improved.      In setting up the committee last year, Yar'Adua noted that  almost every election since 1959 vote that ushered in  independence had been followed by controversy, which threatened  political stability and development.      Nigeria is one of the world's most corrupt countries,  according to independent watchdog Transparency International,  and public office is mostly seen as an avenue to personal  wealth.      Pro-democracy campaigners say politicians stop at almost  nothing to win office and get their slice of the cake.

        "Text": "  (Repeats to additional subscribers, text unchanged)      MOSCOW, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A top Russian general on Friday  said Poland's deal with the United States to set up parts of a  missile defence shield on Polish territory lays it open to a  possible military strike, a Russian news agency reported.      Col-General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, deputy chief of the general  staff, told Interfax that Russian military doctrine would allow  for a possible nuclear strike.      Poland agreed on Thursday to host elements of a U.S. global  anti-missile system after Washington agreed to boost Poland's  own military air defences.      'The USA is engaged in an anti-missile defence for its own  government, and not for Poland. And Poland, in deploying  (elements of the system) opens itself to a military strike. That  is 100 percent,' Interfax quoted Nogovitsyn as saying.      Nogovitsyn said Russia allows nuclear weapons to be used in  circumstances defined by its current security doctrine.      The Russian government revamped its national security  doctrine in 2000, broadening the range of conflicts in which  nuclear weapons could be used.      'It is written clearly: We will use it in instances against  governments that have nuclear weapons; against allies of  countries with nuclear weapons, if they somehow enable them,' he  said.      Washington says the missile system is aimed at protecting  the United States and its allies from long-range missiles that  could in the future be fired by Iran or groups such as al Qaeda.      The Kremlin has long said that was untrue, and has opposed  the shield as a threat to Russia. The 10 interceptor missiles to  be based at a site in northern Poland compare with Russia's own  nuclear arsenal of more than 5,000 ballistic warheads.      In agreeing to deploy elements of the U.S. missile shield,  Poland 'becomes an actionable object. Those targets are  destroyed in the first order,' Nogovitsyn said.      Tension between Moscow and Washington has risen in the past  week, since Georgia's attempt to re-take its separatist region  of South Ossetia by force provoked a massive counter-attack by  Russia.

        "Text": "    By David Brunnstrom      LUXEMBOURG, June 17 (Reuters) - Turkey said on Tuesday it  expected France, long an opponent of Turkish EU membership, to  treat its entry negotiations fairly and openly during its  six-month presidency beginning next month.      At a Luxembourg accession conference, Turkey and the EU  opened two new 'chapters', covering company law and intellectual  property rights, bringing the total under discussion to eight of  35. Ankara, if successful in the slow-moving negotiations, is  not expected to join until 2015 at earliest.      Turkey's progress over the last three years has been  hindered by French resistance, disputes with EU member Cyprus,  EU concerns over human rights in Turkey and the perception in  Europe that Turkey is slow to put reforms into practice.      Turkey's chief EU negotiator, Foreign Minister Ali Babacan,  told a news conference after the talks in Luxembourg that Turkey  expected the EU to honour its commitments and open chapters with  Turkey once it met technical requirements.     'We expect that the French presidency will be a fair,  impartial and transparent presidency as we have been told on  various occasions. We believe our EU accession process will be  further advanced during the French presidency.'      Babacan reiterated complaints that Turkey's progress was  being held up by 'political' considerations of some EU states.            PARTNERSHIP?      'We would like to think that negotiations can advance in  line with the technical readiness of Turkey,' he said.      European Commission Director-General Michael Leigh said the  EU executive was ready to open seven more chapters with Turkey  -- in areas ranging from food safety to social policy -- as soon  as the country met the benchmarks required.      'I expect that during coming months, further progress can be  made,' he told the news conference.      To the annoyance of Ankara and many EU capitals, France  wants to restrict talks to those chapters which could be used as  the basis of a future 'privileged partnership', short of  membership. Turkey rejects any notion of such a 'partnership'.      The European Commission has called on Turkey to implement  stalled reforms on state aid, decentralisation, ombudsman law  and upgrading the powers of the Court of Auditors.      A bid by prosecutors to shut down the ruling AK Party for  alleged Islamist activities is seen casting further political  uncertainty over the accession process.       Opponents to Turkish membership argue that the vast country  would be a drain on EU finances, that as a Muslim nation it  could not integrate well with mainstream European culture, or  that its human rights policies are far short of requirements.      Ankara argues it has a fast growing economy with a young  population and that its cultural and religious roots, tempered  by a strong Western orientation, would allow it to act as a  bridge to the Muslim world.

        "Text": "    By Michael Georgy      JOHANNESBURG, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Intimidation of Angola's  opposition and meddling in the country's electoral commission  threaten chances of a fair vote in the September parliamentary  election, Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday.      It is the first national vote for 16 years in Angola, which  is booming because of soaring oil revenues and recovery from  civil war. Angola wants the vote to set an example on the  continent after flawed polls in Kenya and Zimbabwe.      But Human Rights Watch said in a report that conditions  ahead of the Sept. 5 election did not point to a fair ballot.      'The conditions for free and fair elections start long  before election day,' said Georgette Gagnon, Africa director at  New York-based Human Rights Watch, in a report.      'Less than a month before elections, it's clear Angolans  aren't able to campaign free from intimidation or pressure. And  unless things change now, Angolans won't be able to cast their  votes freely.'      The official campaign kicked off on Aug. 5 with 10 parties  and four coalitions competing for votes. Each party will be  given five minutes of television time each day and 10 minutes on  the radio to lure voters.      A total of 5,198 candidates will fight for 220 parliamentary  seats in a country that rivals Nigeria as Africa's biggest oil  producer, but where two-thirds of the population live on less  than $2 a day.      Based on missions to Luanda and four provinces, Human Rights  Watch said Angola's government is 'failing to fully ensure the  right to free elections, and other rights critical to a fair  poll, including the freedoms of expression and of assembly'.            SECURITY CONCERNS      'Major areas of concern include the government's obligations  to safeguard freedom of assembly and expression and access to  the media by all stakeholders, and to establish an impartial  national electoral body,' it said.      'The government has also failed to provide adequate security  to political parties participating in elections and to ensure  political tolerance and full participation of citizens.'      Angola's government denies accusations of rights abuses.      In a rare radio address this month, dos Santos appealed to  all political parties to maintain the peace as the country  recovers from the 27-year civil war that ended in 2002. he  called for an election that is an example to the world.      On Monday, Angolan police detained 13 people campaigning for  the main UNITA opposition party in the Rangel area outside the  capital Luanda, Catholic Radio Ecclesia reported.      Police told the radio they were accused of holding a rally  without notifying authorities and for disrupting traffic.      Many political observers say UNITA, a former guerrilla  movement, is unlikely to unseat dos Santos's ruling MPLA, which  holds 129 seats out of 220. UNITA has 70 seats.      The parliamentary poll will be followed by a presidential  election in 2009. Dos Santos, who has ruled since 1979, is  expected to run.      The European Union has sent 90 election observers to Angola  and other missions are expected.

        "Text": "    NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - John Lennon's sons and widow,  Yoko Ono, on Monday lost a battle to block the use of the song  'Imagine' in the documentary 'Expelled: No Intelligence  allowed.'      Ono, her son Sean Ono Lennon, and Julian Lennon, John  Lennon's son from his first marriage, along with privately held  publisher EMI Blackwood Music Inc filed suit in April in  Manhattan federal court seeking to bar the filmmakers and their  distributors from continuing to use 'Imagine' in the movie.      They said the film, which looks at alleged discrimination  against scientists and teachers who support so-called  intelligent design as an alternative to Darwin's theory of  evolution, used the song without their permission.      But on Monday U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein found in  favor of the filmmakers based on a 'fair use' doctrine. 'That  doctrine provides that the fair use of a copyrighted work for  purposes of criticism and commentary is not an infringement of  copyright,' the judge said.      The documentary features Ben Stein, an actor, comedian and  former speechwriter for President Richard Nixon.      The suit, which sought unspecified damages, named the  film's producers and distributors -- Premise Media Corporation,  C&S Production LP and Rocky Mountain Pictures.      Lennon recorded 'Imagine' in 1971 and in 2004, Rolling  Stone magazine ranked it No. 3 on their list of the 500  Greatest Songs of All Time, according to the lawsuit.
