        "Text": "A year after electing Barack Obama president, and five years after his star turn at the Democratic National Convention, we are still trying to figure him out.\n\nIs he a left-wing radical or is he a crowd-pleasing moderate? Is he a uniter? Is he actually religious? Is he a socialist? Does he hate America? And, in light of the confidence he projects, why can\u2019t he seem to take criticism?\n\nBut we could, of course, write that first sentence another way: Only a year after electing Barack Obama president, and we are already trying to figure him out.\n\nRather than it being kind of late to attempt a rigorous analysis of President Obama\u2019s psyche, his political philosophy and his managerial style, perhaps it\u2019s a little too soon. Presidential personalities, after all, develop over time. And the famous saying is true that great leaders aren\u2019t born, but made.\n\nNonetheless, because I\u2019m too young for caution, and too old for fear, I\u2019m more than happy to take a stab at it.\n\nLet me first assuage the fears of many of my conservative friends and colleagues: Barack Obama is not a left-wing radical. He is not a socialist, a communist or a Marxist, and he\u2019s not a black liberation theologist. He\u2019s not un-American, he\u2019s not an atheist, and he\u2019s not a racist.\n\nHe is none of those things, because all would require Barack Obama to have a belief system, a worldview, a set of convictions about political philosophy, theology, and socioeconomics that he simply doesn\u2019t have. He is, instead, empty. He is an empty vessel.\n\nThis will shock and offend his legion of admirers on the left, as it stands in stark contrast to the breathless, leg-thrilling declarations by liberal America that Obama is a deep-thinking, complex, contemplative scholar of soaring intellect, a new kind of leader, exquisitely built for a changing world, who knows the war isn\u2019t between good and evil, but between silence and diplomacy, and for whom indecision is a mark of judicious caution.\n\nBut he\u2019d done nothing to deserve those early accolades, of course. So all of that was pre-ordained and pre-packaged, the result of a coordinated and deliberate campaign by a coalition of marketers, politicos, and members of the press to brand Barack Obama as \u201chope and change\u201d before anyone even knew what his selling points were, or if he actually had any.\n\nThe proof of his ideological emptiness is practically undeniable. He has been, over the short course of his political career, the great abandoner, ever-willing to denounce those ideals that were previously sold to his constituents as \u201chis convictions.\u201d\n\nAfter 20 years in Reverend Wright\u2019s church, he simply got up and left. The man who baptized his children, who was marketed (to black voters in particular) as Obama\u2019s spiritual adviser, who was so integral in shaping Barack Obama\u2019s adult life, that he publicly denounced him, and left his church altogether. And he also denounced black liberation theology, despite giving numerous interviews about the ways in which it had helped shape his religious worldview. After initially defending Rev. Wright, suddenly he and his brand of religion were chucked out the window of a moving campaign bus. He has yet to find a replacement, unsurprisingly, but his interest in evangelicals like Rick Warren and Carey Cash means he is open to the theological polar opposite of Rev. Wright.\n\nThe same sort of dance occurred with other politically inconvenient allies, like domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, Wright apologist Father Michael Pfleger, and convicted felon Tony Rezko. Obama distanced himself from all of them and then eventually dumped them altogether when it became politically necessary. Van Jones was merely a post-election victim of Obama\u2019s willing abandonment. And there have been others.\n\nSo would a real radical disown his radical mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s? Would a real extremist and true-believer insist with a straight face that he didn\u2019t really believe all that stuff? Would a real ideologue be persuaded by a public opinion poll to abandon whole ideology?\n\nActual radicals like Wright and Ayers and Jones defend their beliefs, regardless of the pushback and potential fallout. What Obama did, in contrast, was purely political. Because, despite the insistence by the left that Obama somehow transcends politics, that\u2019s what he is \u2013 a politician. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nWe can also look at the shift in his policy positions over the past few years. He was once quoted as saying that he supported a single-payer health care system. The best political decision now, however, was to abandon that for a more docile public option. Once that failed to garner the groundswell of support his advisers thought it would, he appeared altogether indifferent to it. If he were reallya radical, he\u2019d be rallying us around universal health care right now, not some watered-down 1990-page bureaucratic hodge podge that is neither revolutionary nor practical.\n\nHis impassioned pledges to end \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d close Gitmo, bring troops home, end military tribunals, and myriad other promises, suddenly seem less like the stuff of real political conviction, and more like political headaches that require a clever exit strategy.\n\nAnd his reaction to any kind of opposition \u2013 from the right, from the citizenry, from Fox News \u2013 is equally telling. If Obama\u2019s agenda were based on conviction instead of political expedience and an unquenchable thirst for popularity, criticism would bounce right off him. Instead he seems frighteningly flappable. That\u2019s because leadership without convictions is leadership of empty rhetoric. Convictions can be defended against criticism. Empty rhetoric cannot.\n\nSo why all the radical friends and the radical proposals and the radical rhetoric if he\u2019s not himself a radical? Because his lack of conviction and his inability to forge his own philosophical and theological identity, have made him incredibly susceptible to external influence and pressure. He is easily led. He is, as such, the perfect prospect for someone like Bill Ayers or Reverend Wright, whose radical agendas require vulnerable recruits who are malleable and willing.\n\nI don\u2019t know if President Obama is a man of conviction, if he is a man of faith, or if he is the intellectual giant the left really wants him to be. He very well may be all of those things. But I haven\u2019t seen proof of any of it yet, and neither have you, because there hasn\u2019t been any.\n\nThe only thing we do know for sure, one year after anointing this relative unknown the forty-fourth president of the United States, is that he\u2019s a politician, pure and simple. Calling him a radical gives him way too much credit.\n\nS.E. Cupp is a write and co-author of \"Why You're Wrong About the Right.\" She is a frequent contributor to the Fox Forum.",

        "Text": "    Jan 20 (Reuters) - Barack Obama will be sworn in as the  44th president of the United States at noon on Tuesday.      Here are some biographical facts about the first  African-American to hold the nation's highest office.        Age: 47      Birthdate: Aug. 4, 1961      Birthplace: Honolulu, Hawaii      Education: Columbia University; Harvard Law School      Wife: Michelle Robinson Obama      Children: Daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7      Religious affiliation: United Church of Christ      Party: Democrat        Family: Barack Obama was born to a Kenyan father and a  white American mother. His father, Barack Obama Sr., married  his mother, Ann Dunham, while studying at the University of  Hawaii. The couple separated two years after Obama was born.  His father ultimately returned to Kenya, where he became a  noted economist. He died in a car accident in 1982.      Obama's mother's second marriage was to an Indonesian man  named Lolo Soetoro. The family moved to Indonesia and Obama  remained there until he was 10 when he moved back to Hawaii and  lived with his grandparents while studying on a scholarship at  the elite Punahou Academy.      He has seven half brothers and sisters in Kenya from his  father's other marriages, and a half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng,  from his mother's second marriage.        Career: After finishing college in 1983, Obama worked for a  New York financial consultancy and a consumer organization. He  landed a job in Chicago in 1985 as an organizer for Developing  Communities Project, a church-based group seeking to improve  living conditions in poor neighborhoods.      Three years later, Obama left to go to Harvard Law School,  where he became the first black president of the law review. He  worked as a summer associate at the Sidley Austin law firm in  Chicago, where he met his future wife. After graduation from  Harvard in 1991, Obama practiced civil rights law at a small  firm in Chicago, then became a lecturer in constitutional law  at the University of Chicago in 1993.

Obama won a heavily contested U.S. Senate seat in 2004,  carrying 53 percent of the Democratic primary vote in an  eight-candidate race. He easily won the general election as  well. In the U.S. Senate he compiled a liberal voting record,  but was one of the few Democrats to back a measure on  class-action lawsuits. He opposed the appointment of Chief  Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito to the U.S.  Supreme Court.      The nonpartisan National Journal ranked him as the most  liberal member of the U.S. Senate early this year based on his  voting record in 2007. He was ranked 10th most liberal in 2006  and 16th most liberal in 2005.           Presidential campaign: Obama announced his presidential  candidacy on Feb. 10, 2007. Though New York Sen. Hillary  Clinton was initially seen as the front-runner for the  Democratic nomination, Obama quickly showed an ability to raise  large amounts of money and draw record-breaking crowds who were  attracted to his rhetorical skill, his opposition to the Iraq  war, and his promise to move beyond the divisive politics of  the past 40 years.      Obama won the first contest of the Democratic primary in  Iowa in",

His father ultimately returned to Kenya, where  he became a noted economist. He died in a car accident in 1982.      Obama's mother's second marriage was to an Indonesian man  named Lolo Soetoro. The family moved to Indonesia and Obama  remained there until he was 10 when he moved back to Hawaii and  lived with his grandparents while studying on a scholarship at  the elite Punahou Academy.      He has seven half brothers and sisters in Kenya from his  father's other marriages, and a half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng,  from his mother's second marriage.        Career: After finishing college in 1983, Obama worked for a  New York financial consultant and a consumer organization. He  landed a job in Chicago in 1985 as an organizer for Developing  Communities Project, a church-based group seeking to improve  living conditions in poor neighborhoods.

        "Text": "Tension is rising between India and Pakistan because it looks like the killers who attacked Mumbai were based inside Pakistani territory. If shooting breaks out between these two countries, the world will have yet another crisis created by Muslim terrorists.\n\nIt is obvious to sane people that the American intelligence agencies must continue to stay ahead of the terror-killers and disrupt plots like Mumbai should they be directed here. To do that, information from captured terror suspects becomes vital.\n\nBut President-elect Obama has committed himself to an undefined no torture policy and is also having some difficulty finding someone to head up the CIA. Former CIA Chief of Staff John Brennan has taken himself out of the running because some far-left loons criticized him for taking an aggressive anti-terror stance after 9/11.\n\nThis is very disturbing. The far-left wants the CIA to go by the Army Field Manual when interrogating suspects. If that happens, all of us will be in danger.\n\nWhy? Well, here's what the manual says: \"Prisoners of war who refuse to answer (questions) may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.\"\n\nNow \u2014 and this is important \u2014 that is fine for the military. It is not their job to break down terror suspects. It's their job to kill or capture them on the battlefield. The CIA should interrogate high-value targets.\n\nBut if Obama orders the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies not to employ any tough interrogation methods, trust me, many people will die. The terrorists are not going to stop, and only very aggressive action against them has kept us safe since 9/11.\n\nBut these far-left loons, these despicable people who blame America for worldwide terrorism, now have far more power in this country than they did just one month ago.\n\nI believe Barack Obama understands the danger the Muslim terrorists pose to the world. I believe Mr. Obama will not destroy the CIA's ability to break down terror suspects. He has to know that hardcore terrorists are not going to give up information easily.\n\nBut still some people don't get it, and these people are foolish and dangerous, so crazed by their far-left ideology they'd allow innocent people to die for it.\n\nThe USA should never torture, but coerced interrogation at the direction of the president is vital when lives are on the line. Of course, the loons will never acknowledge that. They don't want to do anything \"unpleasant\" to terror suspects.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nAs you may know, actor Patrick Swayze is waging a valiant fight against pancreatic cancer. The 56-year-old actor is working on a new TV show and generally fighting the good fight.\n\nBut a number of tabloids continue to sound the death knell for him, and Mr. Swayze would like them to knock it off. We hope they do, because the man is brave and a patriot.\n\nOn the pinhead front, you make the call on this one. At the opening of a new visitors' center at the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said this:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID, D-NEV.: My staff has always said, \"Don't say this,\" but I'm going to say it again, because it's so descriptive, because it's true.\n\nLeader Boehner mentioned that tourists lined up in the summer and winter, long lines coming into the Capitol. In the summertime, because of the high humidity and how hot it gets here, you could literally smell the tourists coming into the Capitol.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nNo matter how bad the folks smell, it doesn't compete with some of the stuff going on in the Senate.\n\nPinhead? You make the call.\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads & Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

        "Text": "    By Caren Bohan      EVANSVILLE, Ind., April 23 (Reuters) - Barack Obama's rapid  rise from relative obscurity toward winning the Democratic  Party nomination for U.S. president hit another bump when he  lost to rival Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania.      Obama's defeat on Tuesday in the state's nominating contest  slowed his momentum, but he still holds the lead in delegates  who will decide the party's nominee to run against Republican  John McCain in the November presidential election.      Just four years after he burst onto the national political  scene with a keynote speech at the Democratic Party convention,  the questions for those deciding whether to support Obama have  been mostly about his relative inexperience.      Is the 46-year-old first-term senator who would be the  first black U.S. president just a 'phenomenon' desired by a  war-weary nation eager for a fresh face or does he have what it  takes to be an effective president?      Obama cast his scant time on the national political scene  as an advantage, saying it meant his hope and ideals had not  been compromised. His rousing oratory and can-do message struck  a chord early with the public, drawing large crowds and  enthusing young voters.      Doubts over whether voters were 'ready' for a black  president diminished as he steadily chipped away at Clinton's  large early lead and eventually moved past her in the long  run-up to the presidential election.      Once the race was down to two Democratic candidates, there  was little to distinguish them on policy issues.           MULTICULTURAL AMERICA      Obama often points to his roots -- his father was Kenyan  and his mother a white woman from Kansas -- as one reason he  should be picked to run the country, saying he is   representative of multicultural America.      One of his favorite lines --- 'When you're a black guy  named Barack Obama and you're running for president you've got  to have hope' -- regularly draws laughs.      But it is clear Obama has also asked serious questions  about his heritage.      A two-time bestselling author who also won two Grammy  awards for the audio version of his books, Obama chronicled his  struggles to understand himself and his race in 1995 in 'Dreams  from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance.'      He followed up the memoir in 2006 with 'The Audacity of  Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream' outlining his  political principles.      While attracting wide support among African Americans,  Obama eschewed the rhetoric of race struggle and structured his  campaign to appeal to all races.      He has also described himself as a 'blank screen' on which  people of all different political leanings can project their  own views.        CLOSER SCRUTINY      As he moved ahead in the polls and the race for delegates  who pick the party nominee, Democratic and Republican opponents  took a closer look at his record and associates.      Video of Jeremiah Wright, his black pastor at the Trinity  United Church of Christ in Chicago, giving racially and  politically charged sermons, including saying U.S. policies  were partially responsible for Sept. 11 attacks, surfaced on  the Internet in March.      Obama, who borrowed the words 'audacity of hope' from  Wright, was forced to disavow his pastor and ended up giving a  much-praised speech on race in America.      Suddenly, every word and action was under a microscope.  Comments to a closed-door fund-raiser earlier this month sayi",

The plan would include an immediate $250 tax credit to workers  that could double if the economy worsens; a one-time $250  supplement to Social Security retirement payments, a $10 billion  fund to help homeowners facing foreclosure, and a $10 billion fund  to bolster states facing budget shortfalls.      The Illinois senator's office unveiled the proposals while  campaigning in Nevada, which holds the next contested Democratic  primary on Saturday. His leading rival, New York Sen. Hillary  Clinton, also recently unveiled an economic stimulus package.

The U.S. Democratic presidential candidate was ranked No.1  by readers on the AskMen.com lifestyle Web site, beating Apple  chief executive Steve Jobs and Olympic swimming champion  Michael Phelps, who landed in the No. 2 and No. 3 spots,  respectively.      Republican presidential candidate John McCain was ranked  No. 10 on the list, which was compiled on the basis of 200,000  votes from readers of the Web site whose average age is 27-28  years-old.      Last year's winner, British soccer star David Beckham, fell  to No. 25 on the 2008 list, which asked men to go beyond  professional success and likability when picking their top 49  choices.      James Bassil, editor-in-chief of AskMen.com, said he  thought Obama's top place was not so much a political  endorsement of his candidacy as 'a reflection of the interest  the presidential race has ignited in the United States.'

His visit thrusts U.S. strategy in Iraq and troop levels to  the centre of the November election race between the first-term  senator from Illinois and Republican candidate John McCain.  There are more than 140,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq.      Obama has called for the removal of U.S. combat troops  within 16 months of taking office should he win the election.      Iraqiya state television and witnesses said Obama met Prime  Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad. There were no further  details on Obama's visit, which has been shrouded in secrecy for  security reasons.      Obama visited Afghanistan over the weekend, the other big  foreign policy challenge the next American president will face.  He called the situation in Afghanistan 'precarious and urgent'  and said Washington should start planning to transfer more  troops there from Iraq.      Maliki suggested earlier this month setting a timetable for  U.S. troops to leave Iraq but has given no dates.      Obama has welcomed Maliki's suggestion but some Iraqis  insist that the army and police cannot go it alone and that a  premature withdrawal of U.S. troops could open the door to the  sort of violence that nearly tore Iraq apart not so long ago.      On Sunday the Iraqi government denied Maliki told a German  magazine in an interview that he backed Obama's plan to withdraw  combat troops within 16 months. The government said Maliki's  remarks to Der Spiegel were translated incorrectly.       McCain has attacked Obama for not visiting Iraq recently to  get a first-hand look at conditions.      The Republican candidate has been to Iraq eight times while  Obama's only other trip was in January 2006, a month before  militants blew up a revered Shi'ite shrine in Samarra in an  attack that plunged Iraq into vicious sectarian fighting.      The U.S. embassy said Obama, who is visiting Iraq as part of  a U.S. congressional delegation, would also meet U.S. military  commanders and American troops.      Commanders are likely to tell Obama that security gains are  fragile and could be jeopardised by a hasty troop withdrawal.      Obama, trying to boost his foreign policy credentials, will  travel to other countries in the Middle East and visit major  powers in Europe this week.      He has scheduled no news conferences in Iraq.            OBAMA SAYS WANTS TO END THE WAR      Obama courted controversy on July 3 when he said he might  'refine' his views on withdrawing combat troops from Iraq within  16 months but later said his stance had been unchanged for more  than a year and that he intended 'to end this war'.      McCain says the U.S. troop buildup last year helped boost  stability in Iraq and has criticised the Democrat's vow to order  a quick withdrawal as 'reckless'.      But the dramatic reduction in violence has led Baghdad to  become increasingly assertive about its own security  capabilities.      Indeed, Maliki and President George W. Bush agreed last week  to set a 'time horizon' for reducing American forces in Iraq.      It was the closest the",

Obama has called for the removal of U.S. combat troops from  Iraq within 16 months of taking office should he win the  election. He visited Afghanistan over the weekend, the other big  foreign policy challenge the next American president will face.      Obama has come under attack from Republican candidate John  McCain for not making a recent visit to assess conditions in  Iraq, where violence is at a four-year low. McCain has been to  Iraq eight times while Obama's only other trip was in 2006.      The U.S. embassy said Obama, who is visiting Iraq as part of  a U.S. congressional delegation, would meet senior Iraqi  officials and U.S. military commanders.      Seeking to boost his foreign policy credentials, Obama will  travel to other countries in the Middle East and also visit  major powers in Europe this week.      Obama courted controversy on July 3 when he said he might  'refine' his views on withdrawing combat troops from Iraq within  16 months but later said his stance had been unchanged for more  than a year and that he intended 'to end this war'.      McCain says a U.S. troop buildup last year helped boost  stability in Iraq and has criticised Democrats' vows for a quick  withdrawal as 'reckless'.      But with violence down dramatically, Baghdad has become  increasingly assertive about its own security capabilities.      Indeed, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and President  George W. Bush agreed late last week to set a 'time horizon' for  reducing American forces in Iraq.      It was the closest the Bush administration has come to  acknowledging the need for a timeframe for U.S. troop cuts. Bush  has long opposed deadlines for troop withdrawals.      Maliki earlier this month suggested setting a timetable for  U.S. troops to leave Iraq, although he had given no dates.      But the Iraqi government has denied Maliki told a German  magazine in an interview released on Saturday that he backed  Obama's plan to withdraw combat troops within 16 months.      The government has said Maliki's remarks to Der Spiegel were  misunderstood and translated incorrectly.       In a speech last Tuesday, Obama said a 'single-minded' focus  on Iraq was distracting the United States from other threats,  and he promised to shift resources to fighting al Qaeda and the  Taliban in Afghanistan.      Obama called the situation in Afghanistan 'precarious and  urgent' on Sunday and said Washington should start planning to  transfer more troops there from Iraq.

Here are five facts about the Illinois Senator who aims to  become the first black president of the United States:           *Obama's father was born and raised in a village in Kenya; his  mother, who was white, grew up in Kansas.           *Obama grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia. He earned his law  degree from Harvard in 1991 and was the first African-American  president of the Harvard Law Review.           *He is married to wife Michelle and has two young  daughters.           *He was a member of the Illinois State Senate before being  elected to the U.S. Senate. His speech at the Democratic  National Convention in 2004 earned him national attention and  acclaim.           *On issues key to many Democratic voters, Obama favors  withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq, reducing carbon emissions to  fight climate change, and eliminating tax breaks from companies  that move jobs overseas.

        "Text": "    By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor      WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama  pledged a return to science in his inaugural address on  Tuesday, promising a rational approach to transform health care  and action toward an alternative energy policy.      Making a clear break with his predecessor George W. Bush,  Obama repeated campaign promises to 'restore science to its  rightful place'.      * The Bush administration was criticized for packing  scientific advisory panels with industry representatives and  ideologues and Obama's promise suggests a return to a policy of  seeking knowledgeable, non-partisan advisers.      * Bush's anti-abortion policy had a wide influence, from  AIDS programs overseas to breast cancer research at the  National Cancer Institute. Obama is expected to reverse a  Health and Human Services Department regulation aimed at  protecting health care and other workers who invoke their  consciences in refusing care such as contraceptive services.      * Obama is also widely expected to quickly reverse Bush's  executive order that has had the effect of limiting embryonic  stem cell research. Former Surgeon-General Dr. Richard Carmona  complained he was muzzled in attempts to speak out on stem cell  science and other issues.      * Obama also pledged to 'wield technology's wonders to  raise health care's quality and lower its cost'. In his  campaign Obama pledged to spend billions to promote and  facilitate electronic prescribing and record-keeping.      * Obama suggested funding for alternative energy. 'We will  harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and  run our factories,' he said.      * The Bush administration was slow to accept that human  activities had affected global warming. Former Environmental  Protection Agency head Christine Todd Whitman has complained  the White House interfered with her agency's work.

        "Text": "    By Caren Bohan      CHESTER, Va., Aug 21 (Reuters) - U.S. presidential  candidate Barack Obama said on Thursday he would assemble a  foreign policy team of the 'best and the brightest' and  mentioned some people who may be considered for jobs if he wins  the White House.      Former Georgia senator Sam Nunn and former U.S. diplomat  Richard Holbrooke were among the Democrats Obama said he would  turn to for advice.      The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said he  would also seek the counsel of Republicans such as Indiana Sen.  Richard Lugar and Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel.      Republican John McCain, Obama's rival in the Nov. 4  election, has emphasized his background as a Vietnam veteran  and former prisoner of war as well as years of involvement as a  senator in foreign policy to argue that he is more qualified to  serve as U.S. commander-in-chief.      McCain accuses Obama, a first-term Illinois senator, of  lacking seasoning and judgment on foreign policy matters.      At a town hall meeting in Chester, Virginia, Obama said his  early opposition to the Iraq war showed he had better judgment  than McCain, who supported it.      But he added, 'That doesn't mean that I know everything.  I've got to have good, smart advisers around me ... It's not  like I just kind of show up, you know, one day in the White  House and say, 'Alright, what's today?''      Listing those he already consults on foreign affairs, Obama  mentioned Nunn, Holbrooke and former Secretary of Defense  William Perry.      'We will have the best and brightest -- and by the way,  they don't have to be Democrats,' he said. 'There are  Republicans like Richard Lugar, the chairman of the (Senate)  Foreign Relations committee, who is one of my dearest friends  and advisers in the Senate.'      Obama also recalled his trip in July to Iraq and  Afghanistan with Hagel.      'He's a staunch Republican, but Chuck and I agree almost on  every item of foreign policy,' he said.

        "Text": "With the announcement Friday that President Obama will leave about 50,000 troops in Iraq after the bulk of U.S. forces withdraw in 2010, it is becoming clear that on foreign policy the president will govern from the center.\n\nBut it is also now certain that he is a far-left guy on domestic policy. The new budget is simply stunning. Mr. Obama wants to spend more money than at any time since World War II.\n\nPredictably, quasi-socialists like New York Times columnist Paul Krugman are delirious with joy. Here comes the nanny state, starring President Obama and Fran Drescher.\n\nAlso predictably, conservatives like Glenn Beck are outfitting caves in the mountains. The decline and fall of America is at hand.\n\n\"Talking Points\" cannot imagine any Republican senator supporting the massive budget, so it will have trouble getting passed.\n\nBut the die has been cast. President Obama is \"all in\" for a colossal change in American society. That change means the rich will support the poor. Americans who do not succeed will have their bills paid by people like me \u2014 and Barack Obama when he becomes a private citizen again.\n\nThat also means we'll have some kind of new energy in this country, but nobody knows when or what. However, there's plenty of money that will fund the mystery.\n\nAnd gazillions more dollars will flow into America's schools. What this will do, I don't know because if the kids walk around all day with iPods in their ears and rings in their noses, money simply won't matter.\n\nNow, \"Talking Points\" knows he's a mean guy. Criticizing the kids? Come on, how can I do that? Whining about paying other people's bills? That's just downright mean, is it not?\n\nWell that's how the far-left is portraying it. Listen to this new commercial from some progressive loons:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: An economy in crisis, a president determined to act, but what did Republican leaders say to President Obama's jobs and recovery plan?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did they say to 3.5 million jobs?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did they say to tax cuts for 95 percent of working Americans?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: So who are Republican leaders listening to?\n\nRUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: I want him to fail.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tell them America won't take no for an answer anymore.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nThat's what passes for debate these days on the far left: running down anyone with whom they disagree.\n\nBut as \"Talking Points\" said Thursday night, President Obama is taking an enormous gamble, one that will affect all of our lives. He has audacity, no question. But the outcome is still mostly hope.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nOnce a year the Filene's Basement department store here in New York City mounts a sale called the \"Running of the Brides.\" The ladies line up hours ahead of time to get discounts on wedding dresses, and then when the doors open the track meet begins. The excitement is generated by dresses that once cost thousands of dollars marked down to hundreds of dollars.\n\nNow this might be a stretch, but I'm making the ladies patriots because they are thrifty, and we need that in America. So there.\n\nOn the pinhead front, welcome to Will Ferrell's world. The comedian, currently starring in the hit Broadway play about President Bush, started out as the \"Senior Prince of the Winter Ball\" at University High School in Irvine, California.\n\nClick here to see the picture!\n\nNow anyone seeing this picture back then could have predicted Mr. Ferrell would achieve great success. The only mystery: in what area?\n\nPinhead? You make the call.\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads & Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

        "Text": "    By Caren Bohan      CHICAGO, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Newly-elected U.S. president  Barack Obama will face a daunting array of foreign policy  challenges, from wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the global  financial crisis to the need to shore up the country's frayed  international image.      While taxes, health care and the economy all played a role  in the campaign before Tuesday's vote, national security issues  such as the Iranian nuclear standoff and Middle East peace are  likely to remain near the top of the agenda when Obama takes  office from President George W. Bush on Jan 20.      'The mantra for the next administration has to be, 'Be  careful what you wish for because you just might get it,'' said  James Lindsay, who was a foreign policy aide to President Bill  Clinton and is now with the University of Texas, Austin.      'The new president-elect is going to have a full foreign  policy inbox and decisions to make with enormous consequences  for American security,' added Lindsay.      Foreign policy advisers say Obama, a Democrat who will  become the first black U.S. president, has an understanding of  world affairs rooted in a childhood spent partly in Indonesia  and a quest to learn about his father's Kenyan heritage.      The Illinois senator, 47, will face pressing concerns even  before he takes over from Bush, a Republican.      On Nov. 15, Bush will convene a summit in Washington to  look at the global economic crisis. While Obama is unlikely to  attend the meeting himself, it could give his economic team the  chance to meet some of the visiting foreign officials on the  sidelines of the conference.      The Obama administration will also inherit the Iraq and  Afghan wars and an intensifying effort to pursue al Qaeda  militants on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan.      Stopping Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon -- Tehran  says its nuclear program is purely for civilian purposes -- and  holding North Korea to its promise to dismantle its nuclear  weapons program are also pressing issues.           FAMILIAR NAMES, NEW APPROACHES      Obama has a number of foreign policy advisers with roots in  the Clinton administration, although he has also said he could  work with Republicans. Republican Senator Chuck Hagel and  Democratic Senator John Kerry are two names frequently  mentioned as candidates for secretary of state.      Obama, like his defeated Republican rival John McCain, has  vowed a reinvigorated effort toward Middle East peace and  promised staunch support for Israel.      Obama foreign policy adviser Mark Lippert said fighting  terrorism, dealing with militants along the Afghan-Pakistan  border and killing or capturing Osama bin Laden are top  national security priorities.      Obama has pledged to end the Iraq war and bolster the U.S.  troop presence in Afghanistan.      The ability to tackle deteriorating security in Afghanistan  and pursue militants is 'linked to the ability to make progress  on political reconciliation in Iraq and the ability to draw  down there,' Lippert said.      McCain agreed on the need for more forces in Afghanistan,  but opposed a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq, saying U.S.  troops should remain there as long as they are needed.      Obama's willingness to talk directly to U.S. adversaries  such as Iran and Syria was another major point of disagreement  during the campaign. Obama said the Bush administration's  resistance to engaging foes has limited its diplomatic options,  a posit",
