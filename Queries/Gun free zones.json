        "Text": "    SYDNEY, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Australia's gay capital Sydney is  set to try and enforce homophobia-free zones which may see clubs  and hotels lose their licence if patrons commit homophobic abuse  or violence, local media said on Sunday.      The move will focus on the city's main gay precinct Oxford  Street, site of the world's biggest gay and lesbian Mardi Gras  each year, and other areas deemed gay and lesbian precincts.      Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore said the move recognised the  'essential gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender character of  Oxford St' and was a response to gay men who had written to her  about homophobic abuse at nightclubs, said news.com.au.      Sydney's gay media routinely run stories of homophobic abuse  in Oxford St and the gay community has worked with police for  several years to try reduce abuse along the strip.      The council will consult with police, the Aids Council of  NSW and other community groups to develop the strategy.      The move could require local businesses to use signs and  stickers to declare their premises homophobia free and to  include anti-homophobia measures in staff training.      Sydney city councillor Phillip Black, who proposed the plan,  said the idea was similar to alcohol-free or nuclear-free zones  that already exist in the city.      'At this point, the ball is with council staff to develop a  proposal that will come back to council over the next few  months, but it could involve stickers, badges, posters and  T-shirts similar to the Safe Place pink triangle campaign,'  Black said.      'We have to create awareness that homophobia is not  acceptable,' he said.      Sydney Drag Queen Maxi Shield, a City of Sydney Oxford  Street Safety ambassador, welcomed the idea but called for more  police on the street to protect gays.      'More education in anything doesn't go astray, but we need  both awareness and more police,' Shield said. 'We need more  police presence and safety measures, not just putting a label on  it.'

        "Text": "Americans' fears over the safety of schools continues.\n\nLast Monday, three colleges and four K-to-12 schools were shut down by threats of violence.\n\nThis week over 25,000 college students at 300 chapters in 44 states belong to a group, Students for Concealed Carry on College Campuses, that will carry empty handgun holsters to protest their concerns about not being able to defend themselves.\n\nWith the first anniversary of the Virginia Tech attack last week and the discussions that it created, we clearly have not been able to put that and other attacks behind us. There are good reasons why the safety measures adopted over the last year to speed up response times or hiring more police haven't eliminated the fear people feel.\n\nThe attack earlier this year at Northern Illinois University proved that even six minutes was too long. It took six minutes before the police were able to enter the classroom, and in that short time five people were murdered. Compared to the Virginia Tech and other attacks, six minutes is actually record breaking speed, but it was simply not fast enough.\n\nThe Thursday before the NIU murders five people were killed in a city council chambers in Kirkwood, Mo. There was even a police officer already there when the attack occurred. But as happens time after time in these attacks, when uniformed police are there, the killers either wait for the police to leave the area or they are the first people killed. In Kirkwood, the police officer was killed immediately when the attack started. People cowered or were reduced to futilely throwing chairs at the killer.\n\nThere is a problem that people just are unwilling to recognize.\n\nJust like attacks last year at the Westroads Mall in Omaha, Neb., or Trolley Square Mall in Salt Lake City or the recent attack at the Tinley Park Mall in Illinois or all the public schools attacks, all these cases had one thing in common: They took place in \u201cgun free zones,\u201d where private citizens were not allowed to carry their guns with them.\n\nThe malls in Omaha and Salt Lake City were in states that let people carry concealed handguns, but private property owners are allowed to post signs banning guns and those malls were among the few places in their states that chose to post such signs. In the Trolley Square attack an off-duty police officer fortunately violated the ban and stopped the attack. The attacks at Virginia Tech or the other public schools occured in some of the few areas within their states that people are not allowed to carry concealed handguns.\n\nIt is not just recent killings that are occurring in these gun-free zones. Multiple-victim public shootings keep on occurring in places where guns are banned. Nor are these horrible incidents limited to just gun-free zones in the US.\n\nIn 1996 Martin Bryant killed 35 people at Port Arthur in Tasmania, Australia. In the last half-dozen years, European countries including France, Germany and Switzerland have experienced multiple-victim shootings. The worst school attack in Germany claimed 17 deaths, another 14 deaths; one attack in Switzerland claimed the lives of 14 regional legislators.\n\nAt some point you would think that something is going on here, that these murderers aren\u2019t just picking their targets at random. Yet, when one thinks about it, this pattern isn\u2019t really too surprising.\n\nMost people understand that guns deter criminals. The problem is that instead of gun-free zones making it safe for potential victims, they make it safe for criminals.\n\nCriminals are less likely to run into those who might be able to stop them. Everyone wants to keep guns away from criminals, but the problem is who is more likely to obey the law.\n\nA student expelled for violating a gun-free zone at a college is extremely unlikely ever to get into another college. A faculty member fired for a firearms violation will find it virtually impossible to get another academic position. But even if the killer at Virginia Tech had lived, the notion that the threat of expulsion would have deterred the attacker when he would have already faced 32 death penalties or at least 32 life sentences seems silly.\n\nLetting civilians have permitted concealed handguns limits the damage from attacks. A major factor in determining how many people are harmed by these killers is the amount of time that elapses between when the attack starts and when someone with a gun is able to arrive on the scene.\n\nIn cases from the church shooting in Colorado Springs, Colo., last December, where a parishioner who was given permission by the minister to carry her concealed gun into the church quickly stopped the murderer, to an attack last year in downtown Memphis, to the Appalachian Law School, to high schools in such places as Pearl, Miss., concealed handgun permit holders have stopped attacks well before uniformed police could possibly have arrived.\n\nTwice this year armed Israeli citizens have stopped terrorist attacks at schools (once by an armed teacher and another by an armed student). Indeed, despite the fears being discussed about the risks of concealed handgun permit holders, I haven\u2019t found one multiple-victim public shooting where a permit holder has accidentally shot a bystander.\n\nWith about 5 million Americans currently with concealed handgun permits in the U.S. and states starting having right-to-carry laws for as long as 80 years, we have a lot of experience with these laws, and one thing is very clear: Concealed handgun permit holders are extremely law-abiding and lose their permits for any gun-related violation at hundredths or thousandths of one percentage point. We also have a lot of experience with permitted concealed handguns in schools.\n\nPrior to the 1995 Safe School Zone Act, states with right-to-carry laws let teachers or others carry concealed handguns at school, and several states still allow this today. And there is not a single instance that I or others have found where this produced a single problem. There are today even some universities, including large public universities such as Colorado State University and the University of Utah, that let students carry concealed handguns on school property.\n\nWith all the news media coverage of the types of guns used and how the criminal obtained the gun, at some point the news media might begin to mention the one common feature of these attacks: they keep occurring in gun-free zones.\n\nGun-free zones are a magnet for these attacks. But, even without the media, considering that 15 more states this year debated legislation to let concealed handguns on school campuses, possibly the issue is becoming clear anyway.\n\nJohn Lott is the author of Freedomnomics and a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland.",

        "Text": "    By Carey Gillam      KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 22 (Reuters) - A Missouri car dealer  said on Thursday sales have soared at his auto and truck  business since launching a promotion this week that promises  buyers a free handgun or a $250 gas card with every purchase.      Max Motors, a small Butler, Missouri dealership that has as  its logo a grimacing cowboy wielding a pistol, has sold more  than 30 cars and trucks in the last three days, far more than  its normal volume. And owner Mark Muller credits his decision  to start offering buyers their choice of a $250 gas card or a  $250 credit at a gun shop.      'This thing has taken off. Sales have quadrupled,' said  Muller. The store sells both used and new vehicles including  General Motors <GM.N> and Ford <F.N> products.      Every buyer so far 'except one guy from Canada and one old  guy' has elected to take the gun, Muller said. Muller  recommends his customers select a Kel-Tec .380 pistol.      'It's a nice little handgun that fits in your pocket,' he  said.      Muller said the promotion was inspired by Illinois Sen.  Barack Obama, who is vying with Hillary Clinton to be the  Democratic nominee for the presidential election in November.      'We did it because of Barack Obama. He said all those  people in the Midwest, you've got to have compassion for them  because they're clinging to their guns and their Bibles. I  found that quite offensive.'      'We all go to church on Sunday and we all carry guns,' said  Muller. 'I've got a gun in my pocket right now. I have a rifle  in my truck. We've got to shoot the coyotes out here, they're  attacking our cows, our chickens. We're not clinging to  nothing. We're just damn glad to live in a free country where  you can have a gun if you want. This is the way it ought to  be.'

DEMOCRATS      SEN. HILLARY CLINTON      She has said law-abiding citizens should be able to own  guns but laws are needed to keep guns out of the hands of  criminals.

BARACK OBAMA      Wants tighter background checks on gun buyers, making gun  locks mandatory, and holding parents criminally responsible for  children who injure someone with a gun found at home. Supports  reinstating assault-weapons ban.      The National Rifle Association gives him a failing grade of  F for his position on guns.           REPUBLICAN      SEN. JOHN McCAIN      Opposes gun control, calling it 'a proven failure in  fighting crime.' Opposes waiting periods to buy firearms. Has  supported legislation requiring gun makers to include trigger  locks with their products. Opposes reinstating assault-weapons  ban. Has supported mandating background checks on gun buyers at  gun shows.      The National Rifle Association gives him an average grade  of C for his position on guns but says he has a perfect voting  record since 2007 and his grade may be revised.

        "Text": "    SAN FRANCISCO, June 27 (Reuters) - A day after the U.S.  Supreme Court struck down a ban on handguns in Washington,  D.C., the National Rifle Association gun rights group filed  lawsuits on Friday in San Francisco and Chicago against gun  bans there.      'The Supreme Court held yesterday that the Second Amendment  right is exercised individually and belongs to all Americans,'  Chris Cox, the NRA's chief lobbyist, said in a statement.  'These lawsuits will ensure that state and local governments  hear those words.'      The San Francisco lawsuit challenges a local ordinance and  lease provisions barring possession of handguns by public  housing residents.      The Chicago case challenges a handgun ban similar to the  Washington, D.C., law struck down by the Supreme Court. The NRA  also filed lawsuits challenging gun restrictions in the Chicago  suburbs of Evanston, Morton Grove and Oak Park.      'In Washington, D.C., or in any state, whether you live in  the housing projects or a high end suburb, you have the right  to defend yourself and your family at home,' Cox said. 'These  laws all deny that right.'      In its 5-4 decision, the court held that individual  Americans have a right to own guns, a finding that struck down  a strict gun control law in the nation's capital.      The landmark ruling marked the first time in nearly 70  years the high court addressed the Second Amendment of the U.S.  Constitution, and rejected the argument that the amendment's  right to keep and bear arms is tied to service in a state  militia.      San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom said he had expected the  decision to open the door for a challenge to his city's gun  laws.      'I intend to fight any NRA lawsuit that challenges our  common-sense gun laws every step of the way,' he said in a  statement.      San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera echoed Newsom.      'On the basis of the law as it exists today, I am confident  that our local gun control measures are on sound legal footing  and will survive legal challenges,' Herrera said in a  statement.

        "Text": " (Bernd Debusmann is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed  are his own)       By Bernd Debusmann      WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Is America, land of shooting  massacres in schools and public places, slowly falling out of  love with guns?       The answer is yes, and it runs counter to popular  perceptions of the United States as a country where most  citizens are armed to the teeth and believe it is every  American's inalienable right to buy an AK 47-style assault rifle  with the minimum of bureaucratic paperwork.      But in fact, gun ownership in the United States has been  declining steadily over more than three decades, relegating gun  owners to minority status.       At the same time, support for stricter gun controls has been  growing steadily and those in favour make up a majority.      This is a little-reported phenomenon but the trend is shown  clearly by statistics compiled by the University of Chicago's  National Opinion Research Center (NORC), which has been tracking  gun ownership and attitudes on firearms since 1972, the  longest-running survey on the subject in the United States.       The number of households with guns dropped from a high of 54  percent in 1977 to 34.5 percent in 2006, according to NORC, and  the percentage of Americans who reported personally owning a gun  has shrunk to just under 22 percent.        So, by the rules of democratic play, one might assume that  the majority would have major influence on legislation. But  that's not how it works, thanks to the enormous influence of the  gun lobby.       The long-term decline monitored by the Chicago survey has  buoyed proponents of tighter gun controls. 'America's gun  culture is fading,' says Josh Sugarmann, who heads the  Washington-based Violence Policy Center.       According to Sugarmann, those keeping the culture alive and  those most vocal in resisting tighter regulations are white,  middle-aged men whose enthusiasm for firearms, hunting and  shooting is not shared by younger Americans.      Yet, at the moment it's difficult to imagine the U.S.  without its gun culture.       But then, who could have imagined France with a ban on  smoking in public places, Germany with speed limits on almost  half its autobahns, or a black man as a serious contender in  this year's presidential elections in the United States?      To what extent gun ownership will continue to shrink  depends, at least in part, on a decision by the U.S. Supreme  court expected this summer. The court will rule on one of the  most acrimonious disputes in the United States: do Americans  have the constitutional right to own and bear arms?            GUN RAMPAGES PART OF LIFE      At the heart of the long-running debate, argued with more  passion than almost any other, is the meaning of the U.S.  constitution's second amendment.       Written 219 years ago, it says: 'A well regulated Militia,  being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of  the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'      A string of lower court rulings over several decades held  that the amendment meant to guarantee the collective right of  state militias, not individual citizens. Such rulings have had  limited impact: gun regulations vary from state to state and in  most, weapons are easy to buy and legal to keep.      There are a few exceptions: handguns are illegal in Chicago  and in Washington, where a court ruled in December that its  total ban violated the constitution. That ",

The zone is expected to be built next to the Khasab port on  the Musandam peninsula overlooking the strategic waterway,  through which key oil shipping lanes pass.      Oman Daily Observer said last week that a joint venture led  by Port Services Corp <PSC.OM>, which it said had won an initial  government approval to run Khasab port, was considering the  development of the free zone.      'Free zones will play a big part in the Omani economy to  diversify away from oil income and pull in more foreign  investors,' the ministry official, who asked not to be  identified, told Reuters.      The sultanate is also developing other free zones in Sohar  and Salalah.

        "Text": "Despite the high emotions that surround war \u2014 or perhaps because of them \u2014 people are focusing again on \"normal\" life. But what is normal has shifted in ways both obvious and subtle. Consider how war has affected just one issue: the debate over gun control.\n\nFor years, gun ownership advocates have agonized over how to make women comfortable around guns. As of 2000, 41.7 percent of men and 28.5 percent of women reported having a gun in their household, and 39.2 percent of men but only 10 percent of women personally owned a gun.\n\nReaching out to women and minorities has been a high priority of organizations like the National Rifle Association, not merely to swell their ranks but also to convert segments of society that have traditionally opposed the right to own a gun.\n\nNow, the outreach has become easier. As of 2002, over 210,000 women were on active duty within the military, over 150,000 were in the reserves. A steep increase in the number of women in the military means that an unprecedented number of Gen-Next women have overcome their mothers' aversion to guns.\n\nNon-military women also picked up guns. NRA spokeswoman Nance Pretto reported that, in the wake of Sept. 11, women's enrollment in instructional shooting classes increased fourfold from years before. And gun dealers reported a sharp increase in women purchasing weapons.\n\nThe sense of insecurity caused by Sept. 11 was heightened as police officers in the reserves left for active duty, depleting police departments. Some politicians began to actively encourage women to protect themselves by owning guns. When a serial killer was loose in Baton Rouge in the summer of 2002, Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster advised women \"you have a right to get a [concealed] gun permit. ... if you know how [to use a gun] and you have a situation with some fruitcake running around, like they've got right now, it sure can save you a lot of grief.\"\n\nFoster received the predictable backlash of outrage from gun control advocates who suddenly sounded sexist. Holley Galland Haymaker from the anti-gun group Louisiana Ceasefire argued: \"Maybe if you're a big, white guy who hunts all the time, it might do some good. For a woman who is surprise attacked, having a gun is only giving them [the attacker] another way to kill you.\"\n\nI will ignore the racist implications of this remark and simply ask, \"Why would a white guy who hunts be more competent with a gun than a woman who is trained to use it?\"\n\nTo judge from how strained their arguments have become, gun control advocates realize they are losing the debate. It would be difficult to escape this realization. Last Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1036 \u2014 the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \u2014 which grants gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits resulting from their products. The vote (04/09) was 285 to 140. The measure has now moved to the Senate where it is expected to pass.\n\nAs Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., argued, \"Manufacturers of legal products should not live under the threat of litigation simply because their product is misused ... [W]e don't sue Ginsu when someone is stabbed to death with their knife.\"\n\nAgain, the anti-gun arguments were shrill. A paper published by the Brady Center, entitled \"Smoking Guns: Exposing the Gun Industry's Complicity in the Illegal Gun Market,\" openly accused the firearms industry of \"actively and knowingly allowing guns to be sold into the illegal market.\" In short, gun manufacturers were publicly charged with criminal complicity.\n\nOther gun control advocates are pushing to have guns declared as \"weapons of mass destruction (WMD).\" For example, House Bill 1210 in Washington State defined a WMD as a \"device, object, or substance that a person intends to use to cause multiple human deaths.\" No specific weapons were mentioned but the Seattle Times opened its March 15 coverage of the bill with the sentence, \"An anti-terrorism bill has spurred debate among lawmakers: Is a gun a weapon of mass destruction?\" Possession would have been a class A felony had the bill passed with above-referenced language. Many in the pro-gun rights camp view the WMD argument as an indication of attacks to come.\n\nThe underlying facts of the gun debate remain much the same as before Sept. 11 and the war. The award-winning criminologist Prof. Gary Kleck states that firearms are used defensively 2.5 million times a year. 48 percent of those incidents involve women defending themselves; most of the time a shot is not fired. The conclusion: women benefit from gun ownership.\n\nWhat is changing, however, are the faces and attitudes of the debate. A growing number of women feel comfortable with guns and want them for self-defense. In response, anti-gun advocates are using arguments that seem increasingly implausible such as classifying guns as WMDs.\n\nGun ownership is just one of the issues over which we will stumble on the way back to normal life. And, as people drink coffee and read newspapers in the morning, they will discover that the war has influenced every aspect of public debate, including the words we use to describe and redefine our beliefs.\n\nWendy McElroy is the editor of ifeminists.com and a research fellow for The Independent Institute in Oakland, Calif.

        "Text": "    June 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on  Thursday, for the first time in the country's history, that  individual Americans have the right to own guns for personal  use, and struck down a strict gun control law in Washington.      Following is some reaction to the ruling:           WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN TONY FRATTO      'We're pleased that the Supreme Court affirmed that the  Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to keep and  bear arms.'           REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOHN MCCAIN      'I applaud this decision as well as the overturning of the  District of Columbia's ban on handguns and limitations on the  ability to use firearms for self-defense.      'Unlike Senator Obama, who refused to join me in signing a  bipartisan amicus brief, I was pleased to express my support  and call for the ruling issued today.'      'Unlike the elitist view that believes Americans cling to  guns out of bitterness, today's ruling recognizes that gun  ownership is a fundamental right -- sacred, just as the right  to free speech and assembly.      'This ruling does not mark the end of our struggle against  those who seek to limit the rights of law-abiding citizens. We  must always remain vigilant in defense of our freedoms.'        PAUL HELMKE, PRESIDENT OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN  VIOLENCE      'The ... decision ... will most likely embolden criminal  defendants, and ideological extremists, to file new legal  attacks on existing gun laws. With the help of the Brady  Center's legal team, those attacks can, and must, be  successfully resisted in the interest of public safety.      'After the ... ruling, as before, approximately 80  Americans will continue to die from guns every day. Our weak or  nonexistent gun laws contribute to the thousands of senseless  gun deaths and injuries in this country that occur each year.  We must continue to fight for sensible gun laws to help protect  our families and our communities.'           NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION VICE PRESIDENT WAYNE LAPIERRE      'This is a great moment in American history. It vindicates  individual Americans all over this country who have always  known that this is their freedom worth protecting.      'Our founding fathers wrote and intended the Second  Amendment to be an individual right. The Supreme Court has now  acknowledged it. The Second Amendment as an individual right  now becomes a real permanent part of American Constitutional  law.'           NEW YORK CITY MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG      'Eighty people a day die at the hands of guns, we have got  to stop that.'      'The court clearly ruled that reasonable regulations are  permitted under that decision.'        MILES HALL, OWNER OF H&H GUN RANGE IN OKLAHOMA CITY:      'I honestly think that the outright bans are going to  disappear. I think they will all be challenged. Once the  Supreme Court has ruled there is an individual right to own a  gun, I think all those are going to disappear.'      'What we want is for law-abiding citizens to be able to  protect themselves. Period.'

In an open letter to world leaders and combatants in war  zones, 31 Nobel laureates said that more than 70 million  children around the world did not have the chance of an  education and more than half of these lived in conflict areas.      The Nobel laureates included former U.S. President Jimmy  Carter, the Dalai Lama, South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu,  detained Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and  organisations such as Amnesty International.      'War and conflict are perpetrated by adults. But every adult  was once a child and grew up with experiences and guidance that  shaped their lives. At the heart of this lies education,' they  said in the letter, backing a campaign by British charity Save  the Children.      The Nobel laureates called on governments and other parties  to armed conflicts to respect schools as places of peace and  safety, where children could learn free from violence or fear of  recruitment into the armed forces.

        "Text": "    By Ed Stoddard      FORT WORTH, Texas, June 26 (Reuters) - Gun-loving Americans  applauded their Supreme Court on Thursday after it ruled for  the first time in U.S. history that they had a right to own  firearms.      'I think it's great because Americans should have the  freedom to own guns and rifles, because America is a so-called  free country and that is one of our freedoms,' said 16-year-old  high school student and avid raccoon hunter Stella Richardson.      She and her mother were buying a new pistol holster for her  father at a Cabela's shop in Fort Worth, part of a chain  catering to U.S. hunters and gun enthusiasts.      The reaction to the decision was universally favorable  among those browsing in the firearms section of the store,  where hundreds of handguns gleam in glass display cases in  front of long rows of rifles and shotguns.      Individual Americans have a right to own guns, the Supreme  Court ruled for the first time in the country's history,  striking down a strict gun control law in Washington D.C.      The landmark 5-4 ruling marked the first time in nearly 70  years that the high court had addressed the Second Amendment of  the U.S. Constitution.      'I think the decision should have been nine to zero,' said  Don Polk, 60, as he browsed for a handgun.      'I think people up there in Washington should be able to  protect themselves the way that the rest of us have been  allowed to,' he said.      Buying a firearm is not a big problem in Texas where it is  even possible and fairly easy to obtain a permit to carry a  concealed handgun. A 'castle law' enables homeowners here to  shoot intruders if they feel threatened.      Bob Schultz, a Vietnam veteran and gun owner in a Dallas  suburb, spoke to Reuters in his home as he opened his .38  special to show that it was loaded -- as always.      'I wholeheartedly agree with this Supreme Court decision.  But I don't think it will deter the anti-gun lobby, they will  continue to crusade against weapons,' he said.      Besides two handguns, his main 'home defense' system is a  12-gauge pistol grip shotgun with a short barrel. At close  range that will put a big hole in an unwanted intruder.      At Cabela's, 71-year-old Bonnie Deberry browsed with her  husband for new handguns to add to their collection.      'I think you ought to be able to have one and carry them  openly. This country was built on guns,' she said.   (Editing by Anthony Boadle)   ((edward.stoddard@reuters.com; +1 817 421 4743))  Keywords: USA GUNS/COURT GUNSHOP        ",

        "Text": " (Adds Obama, D.C. mayor)      June 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on  Thursday, for the first time in the country's history, that  individual Americans have the right to own guns for personal  use, and struck down a strict gun control law in Washington.      Following is some reaction to the ruling:           WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN TONY FRATTO      'We're pleased that the Supreme Court affirmed that the  Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to keep and  bear arms.'           REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOHN MCCAIN      'I applaud this decision as well as the overturning of the  District of Columbia's ban on handguns and limitations on the  ability to use firearms for self-defense.      'Unlike Senator Obama, who refused to join me in signing a  bipartisan amicus brief, I was pleased to express my support  and call for the ruling issued today.'      'Unlike the elitist view that believes Americans cling to  guns out of bitterness, today's ruling recognizes that gun  ownership is a fundamental right -- sacred, just as the right  to free speech and assembly.      'This ruling does not mark the end of our struggle against  those who seek to limit the rights of law-abiding citizens. We  must always remain vigilant in defense of our freedoms.'        DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BARACK OBAMA      'I have always believed that the Second Amendment protects  the right of individuals to bear arms, but I also identify with  the need for crime-ravaged communities to save their children  from the violence that plagues our streets through common  sense, effective safety measures.      'The Supreme Court has now endorsed that view, and while it  ruled that the D.C. gun ban went too far, Justice Scalia  himself acknowledged that this right is not absolute and  subject to reasonable regulations enacted by local communities  to keep their streets safe.      'Today's ruling, the first clear statement on this issue in  127 years, will provide much-needed guidance to local  jurisdictions across the country.      'As president, I will uphold the constitutional rights of  law-abiding gun-owners, hunters, and sportsmen.'      'Today's decision reinforces that if we act  responsibly, we can both protect the constitutional right to  bear arms and keep our communities and our children safe.'        PAUL HELMKE, PRESIDENT OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN  VIOLENCE      'The ... decision ... will most likely embolden criminal  defendants, and ideological extremists, to file new legal  attacks on existing gun laws. With the help of the Brady  Center's legal team, those attacks can, and must, be  successfully resisted in the interest of public safety.      'After the ... ruling, as before, approximately 80  Americans will continue to die from guns every day. Our weak or  nonexistent gun laws contribute to the thousands of senseless  gun deaths and injuries in this country that occur each year.  We must continue to fight for sensible gun laws to help protect  our families and our communities.'           NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION VICE PRESIDENT WAYNE LAPIERRE      'This is a great moment in American history. It vindicates  individual Americans all over this country who have always  known that this is their freedom worth protecting.

'The government sees SEZs as vehicles of industrialisation  and employment generation,' Kamal Nath said of the so-called  special economic zones (SEZs).

        "Text": "    FRANKFURT, Jan 8 (Reuters) - German energy regulator  Bundesnetzagentur said on Tuesday the number of German gas  market zones would be cut to eight by October to boost trading  and make customer switches less expensive and complicated.      The authority's president Matthias Kurth said in a statement  that gas grid operators had responded to calls to link  previously separate zones so as to simplify shipping procedures  and help consumers.      'Our goal to cut the number of such zones to below 10 will  be reached...towards our ambition to create more liquidity and  competition,' Kurth said.      The announcement came a day after two gas network operators,  Bayernets and E.ON Gastransport (EGT) <EONG.DE>, said they would  handle gas from the North Sea coast through to the Alps for  potentially half of Germany's preferred gas type called H-Gas in  one joint zone from October.      This cut the number of zones already to 11 compared with  over 700 two years ago when the gas market had not yet emerged.      The latest move brought about by the regulator will entail  three networks, those of the transport arms of southern German  GVS, Italy's ENI <ENI.MI> and GdF Deutschland <GDF.PA> to be  brought together, the statement said.      Another zone of operator Gas Union would also cease to exist  in its current form in the autumn, when a new gas delivery year  starts, the Bundesnetzagentur said.      Apart from EGT/Bayernets and the new three-party zone, that  would leave zones operated by RWE <RWEG.DE>, Wingas  <BASF.DE><GAZP.MM>, VNG-Ontras, EWE and EVG Muenster and  northern German BEB, which Shell <RDSa.L> and ExxonMobil <XOM.N>  recently agreed to sell to Dutch state company Gasunie.      Wholesale gas traders say the nascent marketplace needs a  few zones as possible allow for quick shipments through the  pipeline grid, which is the basis of a functioning market.      Encouraged by the changes, Germany's energy bourse EEX last  October started trading a gas contract in the BEB and E.ON  zones.

        "Text": "    June 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Thursday,  for the first time in the country's history, that individual  Americans have the right to own guns for personal use, and struck  down a strict gun control law in the U.S. capital, Washington.           Following are some facts about the case.           * It marks the first time in nearly 70 years that the Supreme  Court has taken up the meaning of the Second Amendment, the  portion of the U.S. Constitution that addresses an individual's  right to bear arms.      * The Supreme Court's previous review of the Second  Amendment came in a five-page discussion in an opinion issued  in 1939 that failed to definitively resolve the constitutional  issue.      * At issue was the city's strict gun-control law -- a ban on  private possession of handguns and requirement that any rifles or  shotguns kept at home be unloaded and disassembled or bound by a  trigger lock.      * The court's ruling could have a far-reaching impact on  gun-control laws in the United States, which is estimated to have  the world's highest civilian gun ownership rate. The ruling could  become an issue in the November presidential election.      * During oral arguments in March, Justice Stephen Breyer  cited statistics that between 80,000 and 100,000 people in the  United States every year are killed or wounded in gun-related  homicides or crimes, accidents or suicides. He said that in  Washington, D.C., the number totals around 200 to 300 dead and  between 1,500 to 2,000 people wounded.      * The arguments followed a string of mass shootings in the  previous year -- multiple killings on at least three college  campuses, two shopping centers and one Missouri town meeting.      * The case divided the Bush administration. Then-Solicitor  General Paul Clement, the administration's lawyer before the  Supreme Court, said individuals have a right to own a gun, but  it is subject to reasonable government regulation. Vice  President Dick Cheney joined a group of U.S. House of  Representatives and Senate members in urging a stronger stand  in favor of gun rights.

        "Text": "    By Ashleigh Patterson      TORONTO, May 27 (Reuters) - Firearm enthusiasts slammed  Toronto's proposed anti-gun measures on Tuesday, which would  see shooting ranges, gun clubs and firearm manufacturers banned  from Canada's largest city.      Toronto Mayor David Miller announced on Monday he will  support staff recommendations contained in a new report that  recommends restrictions on land use for the manufacture,  distribution, assembly, warehousing and discharge of guns as  part of the city's move to reduce gun crime.      The report also calls for new zoning regulations that would  eliminate recreational use of firearms, effectively terminating  permits for gun clubs in Toronto.      Marc Porter, a member of the Forest Hill Revolver Club, who  owns two target pistols, said Miller was 'misguided in his  quest' to rid the city's streets of gun violence, adding that  only athletes and hobbyists will suffer.      'I've been doing this for 31 years and we are not the  problem. We are not training criminals; we are not offering  criminals instruction,' Porter said.      Inspector Tony Cooper, Ontario's acting chief firearms  officer, said the clubs have not been a public safety issue      'It's the mayor's prerogative to do whatever he likes, but  we have had no problem with those particular ranges,' he said.      In April, Miller launched an online petition for a  Canada-wide handgun ban after two innocent bystanders were  fatally shot downtown in January.      According to a city report, more than 1,200 Canadians are  killed and over 1,000 are injured by firearms each year. In  2006, Toronto experienced the highest number of victims of  firearm-related violent crimes in Canada.      Canada's firearm-related homicide rate is six times lower  than that of the United States, however it is three times  higher than Australia's and six times higher than that of  England and Wales, according a 2006 Statistics Canada report.
