Covering the conflict for PJTV.com, a U.S. conservative  website, Joe Wurzelbacher was in the southern Israeli town of  Sderot on Sunday, a target of rockets from the Hamas-ruled Gaza  Strip, and defended Israel's 16-day-old offensive.      'I've seen some very bad press about Israel,' said  Wurzelbacher, a colourful figure in the U.S. presidential  campaign in which defeated Republican John McCain cited the Ohio  plumber as an example of someone who would be hurt by Democrat  Barack Obama's tax plan.      'Israel is being attacked and they're defending themselves,'  Wurzelbacher told reporters. His remarks were interrupted by an  alert for an incoming rocket which sent him dashing to a  concrete shelter. No one was hurt.      Gaza medical officials said 874 Palestinians have been  killed and more than 3,000 wounded since Israel's offensive  began on Dec. 27. Israel says 10 soldiers have been killed and  rocket fire has killed three civilians.

The man, who admitted his guilt, said his girlfriend had  recently moved out and left behind 'Popeye', a 2-year-old black  and white cat.      He had just returned from a nearby bar and got angry at the  cat for making a mess, the court heard.

        "Text": "    By Nick Carey      HOLLAND, Ohio, Oct 17 (Reuters) - After three days as a key  figure in the U.S. presidential campaign, Joe the Plumber would  like his old life back -- as soon as he finishes another round  of interviews.      'I'm just a plumber. I just want to get on with my life and  do my job,' Joe Wurzelbacher said in an interview on Friday  outside his modest home in middle America. 'I'd prefer to do  that without people camped out on my doorstep.'      Wurzelbacher's privacy became a victim of modern day  politics. Anxious to appear in touch with ordinary Americans  ahead of the Nov. 4 presidential election, Democrat Barack  Obama and Republican John McCain brought Wurzelbacher, 34, into  the glare of the presidential election campaign in their debate  Wednesday night and the plumber's life has been far from  ordinary ever since.      Early in the debate McCain cited Wurzelbacher as an example  of someone who would be hurt under Obama's tax plan. The  sparring candidates went on to refer to Joe the Plumber more  than two dozen times in the televised debate and within hours a  media circus had descended on a previously quiet street of  modest homes in the suburbs of Toledo.      Reporters quickly revealed that Wurzelbacher did not have a  plumbing license, had fallen behind on his taxes, had a real  first name of Sam, not Joe, along with other personal details  of Wurzelbacher's life.      It has left Joe the Plumber feeling drained.      'It's been tough to have the media all over this and coming  up with some things that aren't true,' he said. 'I have family  to think about, I have a 13-year-old son, it's hard to have  them see so many things about me that are negative.'           CONSERVATIVE MEDIA DARLING      To be sure, Wurzelbacher initially courted the attention.  It all started when Obama, campaigning door-to-door in  Wurzelbacher's neighborhood for the benefit of a trailing media  pack, met the plumber. Wurzelbacher asked a few pointed  questions about Obama's tax policy, complaining he could not  afford some of the provisions.      The confrontation made Wurzelbacher the darling of  conservative media for a day or two. Then came the debate.      The single father thinks all the attention is crazy.      'There are bigger issues to worry about than me,'  Wurzelbacher said. 'Whoever wins the election is going to have  to deal with things like people losing their jobs, health care  and immigration. This shouldn't be about me. It should be about  them.'      While the media have managed to dig up many personal  details of Wurzelbacher's life, he has kept at least one thing  secret: 'No one knows who I'm voting for,' he said, although he  has said he thought McCain did well in the debate.      McCain has apologized for subjecting Wurzelbacher to such  media scrutiny but he is in for a few more days of fame. While  camera crews remained stationed outside his home on Friday  morning, Wurzelbacher headed to New York for a couple more  media appearances.      His house remains a political tourist attraction for those  who see Wurzelbacher as one of them -- ordinary Americans often  overlooked by Washington.      Just after Wurzelbacher headed out, a couple of young guys  drove by in a red Chevrolet pickup truck. They slowed down to  yell encouragement.     'Good job, Joe,' they said. 'Way to go standing up for  America.'     (Reporting by Nick Carey; Writing by Andrea Hopkins; Editing  by Bill Trott)   ((andrea.hopkins@thom",

        "Text": "    By Andy Sullivan      WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Barack Obama and John McCain  may have turned him into the most famous small-business owner  in America, but Joe the Plumber isn't about to return the favor  with an endorsement.      The morning after he emerged as the unexpected star of  Wednesday night's presidential debate, Joe Wurzelbacher of  Holland, Ohio, declined to say who he will vote for in the Nov.  4 election.      'It's a personal decision, and myself and the button I push  will know the answer,' the 34-year-old plumber said on ABC's  'Good Morning America' program.      Wurzelbacher came to prominence last week when he asked  Obama about his tax plan during a campaign stop, which led to  an appearance on a Fox News talk show and an invitation to a  McCain rally.      Wurzelbacher said the sudden attention hasn't yet  translated into increased business.      'I hope I have a lot of jobs today. Yesterday I worked on a  water main break for a gas station and that's why I didn't give  any interviews. I was muddy and soaking wet,' he said.      Obama and McCain repeatedly invoked Wurzelbacher in their  final debate as they sought to appeal to average Americans.  McCain, a Republican, said Obama's plan to raise taxes on those  making more than $250,000 a year would hurt small-business  owners like Wurzelbacher.      Obama, a Democrat, said he would make it easier for  Wurzelbacher to provide health insurance for his employees.      Wurzelbacher told ABC he's 'not even close' to earning  $250,000, but worried that Obama would increase taxes for those  making less.      In a video interview with the Toledo Blade newspaper after  the debate, Wurzelbacher described himself as a man of modest  means.      'You see my house. I don't have a lot of bells and whistles  in here, really. My truck's a couple of years old and I'm going  to have it for the next 10 years, probably. So I don't see him  (Obama) helping me out.'      He said he wasn't swayed by Obama's health-care pitch,  either, describing it as 'just one more step toward  socialism.'      Wurzelbacher said he was pleased with McCain's performance.  'McCain came across with some solid points, and I was real  happy about that,' he said.

        "Text": "    By Jeff Mason      MIAMI, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee  John McCain said on Friday an Ohio man dubbed 'Joe the  Plumber,' who raised questions about Democrat Barack Obama's  tax plan, was being smeared by Democratic attacks.      McCain spent the day campaigning in Florida, trying to fend  off a strong challenge from Obama in a state the Republicans  have taken in the last two presidential elections but is up for  grabs on Nov. 4.      Obama was in Roanoke, Virginia, a traditionally Republican  state that is also tilting more Democratic this year. The  Illinois senator attacked McCain's health care plan.      Leading national opinion polls and surveys in key  battleground states, Obama picked up the endorsements of The  Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times.      The Post said both Obama and McCain are 'unusually talented  and qualified' candidates, but it questioned McCain's choice of  Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate  because she is 'not ready to be president.'      Speaking at a lively rally in Miami, McCain said Joe  Wurzelbacher, of Holland, Ohio, was being punished for asking  Obama a legitimate question.      'Last weekend, Sen. Obama showed up in Joe's driveway to  ask for his vote, and you know what Joe did? He asked Senator  Obama a tough question. I'm glad he did; I think Senator Obama  could use a few more tough questions,' McCain said.      'He wasn't recruited or prompted by our campaign. He just  asked a question. And Americans ought to be able to ask Senator  Obama tough questions without being smeared and targeted with  political attacks,' he said.      Democrats have been sharply critical of Wurzelbacher in the  days since 'Joe the Plumber' questioned Obama's plan to tax  Americans making more than $250,000 a year.           MCCAIN: 'HOLD ONTO YOUR WALLET'      The tax question prompted Obama to say he wanted to 'spread  the wealth around,' a comment that McCain and Republicans have  jumped on as a sign that the Democrat would pursue income  redistribution policies if elected.      Obama and McCain brought up Joe the Plumber more than two  dozen times at a debate on Wednesday night. Wurzelbacher's  brush with fame has come at a cost. The New York Times reported  that Wurzelbacher does not have a plumber's license and owes  back taxes.      The Arizona senator ridiculed Obama's remark about  spreading the wealth, saying, 'When politicians talk about  taking your money and spreading it around, you'd better hold  onto your wallet.'      Obama, trying to blunt McCain's appeal in retiree-haven  Florida, told about 8,000 supporters that McCain's health care  proposal to give Americans a $5,000 tax credit to help pay for  health insurance would require taxing health benefits, and  cutting the Medicare insurance program for seniors by $882  billion.      'If you count on Medicare, it would mean fewer places to  get care, and less freedom to choose your own doctors. You'll  pay more for your drugs, receive fewer services, and get lower  quality care. I don't think that's right,' Obama said.      McCain economic adviser Doug Holtz-Eakin charged that Obama  has 'consistently lied' about McCain's health care plan.      Holtz-Eakin said McCain's tax credit 'will not only shield  millions of families from a tax increase, but will actually  give them more dollars to invest in their health care needs.'      'The McCain plan does not tax medical expenses like the  cost of a pro",

        "Text": "    HOUSTON, June 3 (Reuters) - After more than a year of  training, a rocket ride to space and a two-day journey to reach  the International Space Station, the shuttle Discovery crew  floated into the orbital outpost with these words:      'Someone call a plumber?'      Someone had. With the $100 billion space station's sole  toilet on the blink, NASA made room aboard shuttle Discovery  for a new pump, which they hope will fix the problem.      'Yeah, we got it,' commander Mark Kelly assured station  flight engineer Garrett Reisman as the two greeted each other  in orbit on Monday.      The scene, captured was replayed on NASA TV early on  Tuesday.      The space station toilet, housed in the Russian-built  Zvezda module, is disposing of solid waste but the urine  collection system is not working properly. Every three flushes  or so it must be manually flushed with water, which takes two  crew members about 10 minutes.      While Discovery is docked at the space station, 210 miles  (338 km) above Earth, the three space station crew and the  seven visiting astronauts will have access to the shuttle's  toilet.      Repairs to the Russian-made space station commode fall to  station commander Sergei Volkov and flight engineer Oleg  Kononenko. The work is scheduled for Wednesday, NASA said.

        "Text": " (adds additional comments new graphs 4-5)      By Andy Sullivan      WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Barack Obama and John McCain  may have turned him into the most famous small-business owner  in America, but Joe the Plumber isn't about to return the favor  with an endorsement.      The morning after he emerged as the unexpected star of  Wednesday night's presidential debate, Joe Wurzelbacher of  Holland, Ohio, declined to say who he will vote for in the Nov.  4 election.      'It's a personal decision, and myself and the button I push  will know the answer,' the 34-year-old plumber and single  father said on ABC's 'Good Morning America' program.      Later outside his home he told a crowd of reporters 'I want  the American people to vote for who they want to vote for,' and  in an informed way.      He also said he was proud of what the U.S. military has  accomplished in Iraq, feels his views are shared by many middle  class working people he knows, is tired of people criticizing  the United States and feels that the U.S. Social Security  program is a 'joke.'      Wurzelbacher came to prominence last week when he asked  Obama about his tax plan during a campaign stop, which led to  an appearance on a Fox News talk show and an invitation to a  McCain rally.      Wurzelbacher said the sudden attention hasn't yet  translated into increased business.      'I hope I have a lot of jobs today. Yesterday I worked on a  water main break for a gas station and that's why I didn't give  any interviews. I was muddy and soaking wet,' he said.      Obama and McCain repeatedly invoked Wurzelbacher in their  final debate as they sought to appeal to average Americans.  McCain, a Republican, said Obama's plan to raise taxes on those  making more than $250,000 a year would hurt small-business  owners like Wurzelbacher.      Obama, a Democrat, said he would make it easier for  Wurzelbacher to provide health insurance for his employees.      Wurzelbacher told ABC he's 'not even close' to earning  $250,000, but worried that Obama would increase taxes for those  making less.      In a video interview with the Toledo Blade newspaper after  the debate, Wurzelbacher described himself as a man of modest  means.      'You see my house. I don't have a lot of bells and whistles  in here, really. My truck's a couple of years old and I'm going  to have it for the next 10 years, probably. So I don't see him  (Obama) helping me out.'      He said he wasn't swayed by Obama's health-care pitch,  either, describing it as 'just one more step toward  socialism.'      Wurzelbacher said he was pleased with McCain's performance.  'McCain came across with some solid points, and I was real  happy about that,' he said.

        "Text": "This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity & Colmes,\" October 17, 2008. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nSEAN HANNITY, CO-HOST: There you have it. With just 18 days away from election day, and the newest political star, Joe the plumber, is seeing the dirty side of politics. Joe, an Ohio plumber, became a household name after he questioned Barack Obama's tax plan. Now, since then he's been criticized about everything, from not having a plumber's license to owing money in back taxes, and today Senator McCain defended Joe at a rally in Florida.\n\nLet's take a listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R-AZ), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The response from Senator Obama and his campaign yesterday was to attack Joe \u2014 was to attack Joe. People are digging \u2014 people are digging through his personal life, and he has TV crews camped out in front of his house. He didn't ask Senator Obama to come to his house. He wasn't \u2014 he wasn't recruited or prompted by our campaign. He just asked a question.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Joining us now is the cofounder of Real Clear Politics, Tom Bevan, and radio talk show host Dennis Prager will be joining us in a minute, and also joining us, Obama supporter Michael Brown.\n\nAll right. Now before we get to anything here, it's \u2014 all he did was ask a question. Now he's had a full background check and smear and attack and besmirched, this poor guy.\n\nLet's watch as Biden and Obama mock him, and listen to the laughing in the crowd as we play this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. BARACK OBAMA (D-IL), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He's trying to suggest that a plumber is the guy he's fighting for. How many plumbers do you know making a quarter million dollars a year?\n\nSEN. JOE BIDEN (D-DE), VICE-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: John continues to cling to the notion, the fact that this guy, Joe the plumber. I don't know how many Joe the plumbers in my neighborhood that make $250,000 a year and are worried.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: I think to attack this man who asked a simple question, that if he starts a business, you know, and to mock him and let the crowd mock him and to let the media investigate him, you know, didn't pay back taxes, this is so fundamentally despicable.\n\nWhy can't you as a Democrat say you know what? Leave Joe, the plumber alone. He's out there swinging a wrench for 12 hours a day, probably six or seven days a week. Do you think it's unfair what's happening to him?\n\nMICHAEL BROWN, OBAMA SUPPORTER: Yes, I do, Sean. We and I are probably going to agree on this issue.\n\n\u2022 Video: Watch Sean and Alan's interview\n\nHANNITY: Good for you.\n\nBROWN: Now frankly, it doesn't really matter much. I don't think voters necessarily care, and frankly, Senator Obama and Senator Biden I don't think are really putting that much into it. Clearly, you've taken some snippets.\n\nHANNITY: Snippets? Yes, I know, Jeremiah Wright snippets. Bill Ayers snippets.\n\nBROWN: But at the end of the day \u2014 at the end of the day, Sean, voters don't really matter or care about this particular issue. They do care about \u2014 they do care about the folks who are wondering how they're going to get their next job...\n\nHANNITY: All right. But then why mock \u2014 wait a minute. You can't have it both ways. Here's the difference. And let me go to Tom on this. You can't have it both ways. You can't mock, you know, Joe the plumber...\n\nBROWN: No one's mocking him.\n\nHANNITY: They were mocking \u2014 I don't know any plumber that makes $250,000 a year. The guy wants to own his own business.\n\nAnd Tom, the way I see this race, and maybe \u2014 maybe Sean Hannity is in a different direction than the rest of the country. The guy who had to drop out of college, the guy that was scrubbing pots and pans \u2014 that's me \u2014 when I was 12 years old, you know, trying to make my own way in life, that I was told, \"You need a helping hand, look down at the end of your arm.\" That's your helping hand.\n\nBut what I'm trying to \u2014 I think America has a choice in this election. Either we're going to become European socialists, we're going to be France, and wave the white flag of surrender, and we're going to nationalize health care and we're going to spread, redistribute the wealth, that's our patriotic duty, or we're going to be Americans with individual responsibility. Is that a fair choice that I'm outlining for the American people?\n\nTOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Well, I mean that's the distinction, the contrast that John McCain has been trying to draw with Obama, the sort of traditional liberal-conservative. But he's been terribly ineffective at it until Joe the plumber came along and served as a sort of vehicle in asking this question.\n\nBecause the fundamental issue here is not Joe the plumber or even the question he asked. It's really Obama's response, spreading the wealth around. McCain's been able to key off that to his advantage, I think, over the last couple of days.\n\nALAN COLMES, CO-HOST: Tom and Michael \u2014 Michael, McCain and Biden \u2014 I should say Biden and Obama were not mocking Joe the plumber. They were mocking John McCain \u2014 excuse me. They were mocking John McCain and his use of Joe the plumber and trying to hold this guy up. John McCain vetted Joe the plumber about as well as he vetted Sarah Palin. That's what the problem is.\n\nBROWN: And you know...\n\nHANNITY: That's a cheap shot against Sarah Palin.\n\nCOLMES: No, it's not against Sarah Palin, Sean. It's against John McCain's lack of vetting of a candidate and a bad choice for a vice- presidential...\n\nHANNITY: She's the most popular governor in the country.\n\nCOLMES: You've got a \u2014 we don't need the guests on. We're going to go at it now. You've got a bunch of conservatives going after Sarah Palin. You've got Kathleen Parky (ph). You've got, you know, a whole bunch of conservatives...\n\nHANNITY: Two people.\n\nCOLMES: ... going after and saying she shouldn't be on the ticket. But that's not the issue here. The issue is Joe the plumber, Michael, and it wasn't he who was being \u2014 that was not the target of the comments of Barack Obama and Joe Biden. He wasn't vetted properly by the McCain campaign.\n\nBROWN: Well, I would bet the McCain campaign now are talking about Joe the plumber as much as possible, because any time they can get off the issues that matter to the American people, they think that's a winner for them. Any time they can do distraction politics, they think that's a winner for them.\n\nSo Joe the plumber, you're going to hear about that from John McCain and Sarah Palin for quite a while now.\n\nBut Barack Obama and Joe Biden are going to focus on things that matter.\n\nCOLMES: Also Tom \u2014 yes.\n\nBROWN: Education, gas prices, the economy, foreign policy. Those are things that really matter now to people, not Joe the plumber. I'm sure he's a nice guy and he shouldn't be slandered.\n\nCOLMES: He's probably a great guy and works very, very hard.\n\nBROWN: But Sean, that's a very small issue.\n\nCOLMES: And Tom, you know, this is a guy who, it turns out, is not a swing voter. He's not an independent. He's a registered Republican. He's not a licensed plumber.\n\nAnd, in fact, forget about McCain or anybody else here, you've got the \u2014 or Obama or Biden throwing him down the stairs. You've got the head of his local union saying he's not licensed, he didn't take training, and he shouldn't be calling himself a plumber. That's the head of his union there, not anybody in a political campaign.\n\nBEVAN: But Alan, that's not necessarily the issue. And the idea that the McCain campaign would have to vet a private citizen for asking questions is somewhat ridiculous.\n\nAnd now you've got a situation where you've got John McCain out there defending this guy, who happens to be a working class guy from Ohio. He may not be a swing voter. He may be, you know, a conservative, but that's not the issue. The atmospherics of it are, that you've got McCain defending those kind of voters, and Obama's now kind of mocking them or making fun of them.\n\nCOLMES: Well, I think he's not making \u2014 again, I think he's making fun of McCain for using them, not for the guy himself. But thank you very much for being with us, both of you.\n\nWatch \"Hannity & Colmes\" weeknights at 9 p.m. ET!\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2008 FOX News Network, Inc. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The two candidates hit the campaign trail -- Obama in New  York and New Hampshire and McCain in Pennsylvania -- after  their third and last presidential debate on Wednesday, a testy  face-off that made an Ohio plumber famous.      So far, all the stars seemed to be lining up in Obama's  favor. He leads in national opinion polls and in many of the  battleground states where the Nov. 4 race will be won or lost.      Late on Thursday, The Washington Post delivered an  endorsement of Obama and a rebuke to McCain in an editorial on  its web site (www.washingtonpost.com). The Post, one of  America's most respected newspapers, said its endorsement of  Obama was 'without ambivalence.'      'The choice is made easy in part by Mr. McCain's  disappointing campaign, above all his irresponsible selection  of a running mate who is not ready to be president,' the Post  editors wrote. 'It is made easy in larger part, though, because  of our admiration for Mr. Obama and the impressive qualities he  has shown during this long race.'      A confident but cautious Obama told supporters in New York,  'We are now 19 days not from the end but from the beginning.  The amount of work that's going to be involved for the next  president will be extraordinary.'      Traders betting on future events in the political  prediction markets are overwhelmingly predicting an Obama  victory, giving the Illinois Democrat a better than 80 percent  chance of winning.      Ireland's biggest bookmaker, Paddy Power, was already  declaring Obama the winner. The Dublin-based bookmaker said it  would pay out early more than 1 million euros ($1.35 million)  on bets that Obama will be the next U.S. president.           REMEMBERING NEW HAMPSHIRE      But Obama pointed out to deep-pocket contributors at a  fundraising breakfast in Manhattan, and later to supporters in  a driving rain in Londonderry, New Hampshire, that he was  supposed to win New Hampshire last January in the Democratic  primary but lost the state to Sen. Hillary Clinton.      'We are 19 days away from changing this country -- 19 days.  But for those who are getting a little cocky, I've got two  words for you: New Hampshire. I learned right here that you  can't let up or pay too much attention to the polls,' he said.      In New York, he said, 'I've been in these positions before  when we were favored and the press starts getting carried away  and we end up getting spanked.'      The new star in U.S. politics -- at least for a news cycle  or two -- is Joe Wurzelbacher, 'Joe the plumber,' who told  Obama at a campaign stop that he wanted to buy a small plumbing  business in Holland, Ohio.      Joe came up about two dozen times during the debate as each  candidate argued that their prescriptions for America's  economic ills would help the plumber best.      Wurzelbacher was all over morning television shows and was  not saying who he would vote for, but he sounded like a McCain  backer.      'McCain came across with some solid points, and I was real  happy about that,' he told the ",

McCain went on the offensive quickly, criticizing Obama's  proposal to raise taxes on Americans who make more than  $250,000 a year and saying it would hurt small business owners  like a plumber named Joe who Obama met on the campaign trail.      'Why would you want to raise anybody's taxes right now?'  McCain asked Obama. 'We need to encourage businesses.'      Obama said his plan would cut taxes for 95 percent of  Americans and raise them on only a small slice of the most  high-income Americans, while McCain would give tax breaks to  oil and gas companies.      'We both want to cut taxes,' Obama, an Illinois senator,  said in their third and last White House debate at Hofstra  University. 'The difference is who we want to cut taxes for.'      McCain, an Arizona senator, entered the debate under  intense pressure to turn in a strong performance that could  turn around a presidential race that has shifted decisively in  Obama's favor after weeks of economic turmoil and plunging  stock markets.      Opinion polls three weeks before the Nov. 4 election show  more voters say they trust Obama's leadership on the economy,  which has dominated the campaign-trail discussion and dwarfed  McCain's expertise in foreign and military policy.

        "Text": "    * Obama says 19 days from beginning, not end      * Polls show Obama with edge over McCain      * Rivals to meet again at charity dinner        By John Whitesides, Political Correspondent      NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Democratic presidential  nominee Barack Obama warned his supporters to guard against  overconfidence on Thursday as he and underdog Republican rival  John McCain opened a 19-day sprint to Election Day.      The two candidates hit the campaign trail -- Obama raising  money in New York and McCain holding a rally in Pennsylvania --  after their third and last presidential debate on Wednesday, a  testy face-off that made an Ohio plumber famous.      So far, all the stars seemed to be lining up in Obama's  favor. He leads in national opinion polls and in many of the  battleground states where the Nov. 4 race will be won or lost.      Traders betting on future events in the political  prediction markets are overwhelmingly predicting an Obama  victory, giving the Illinois Democrat a better than 80 percent  chance of winning.      But Obama pointed out to deep-pocket contributors at a  fund-raising breakfast in Manhattan that he was supposed to win  New Hampshire last January in the Democratic primary but lost  the state to Sen. Hillary Clinton.      'For those of you who are feeling giddy or cocky or think  this is all set, I just have two words for you: New Hampshire,'  Obama said.      'I've been in these positions before when we were favored  and the press starts getting carried away and we end up getting  spanked,' he said.           NEW POLITICAL STAR      The new star in U.S. politics -- at least for a news cycle  or two -- is Joe Wurzelbacher, 'Joe the plumber,' who told  Obama at a campaign stop that he wanted to buy a small plumbing  business in Holland, Ohio.      Joe came up about two dozen times during the debate as each  candidate argued that their prescriptions for America's  economic ills would help the plumber best.      Wurzelbacher was all over morning television shows and was  not saying who he would vote for, but he sounded like a McCain  backer.      'McCain came across with some solid points, and I was real  happy about that,' he told the Toledo Blade newspaper.      Although McCain went after Obama aggressively in the final  debate, it might not have done much to change the shape of the  race in its final stages.      Karl Rove, the architect of President George W. Bush's two  electoral victories and now a political pundit, wrote in The  Wall Street Journal on Thursday that McCain has difficult but  not impossible odds.      'If Mr. McCain succeeds, he will have engineered the most  impressive and improbable political comeback since Harry Truman  in 1948. But having to reach back more than a half-century for  inspiration is not the place campaign managers want to be now,'  Rove wrote.      The two candidates will be on the same stage again on  Thursday night when they give speeches at the Al Smith charity  dinner, a political tradition in Manhattan named for the former  New York governor and a regular stop for presidential  candidates.

        "Text": "    * Obama to drop off campaign trail to visit grandmother      * McCain gives strong support to running mate Palin      * Obama widens his lead in poll           By Steve Holland      ORMOND BEACH, Fla., Oct 23 (Reuters) - Republican  presidential nominee John McCain hammered Democrat Barack Obama  on taxes and national security on Thursday on a bus tour across  parts of Florida crucial to his hopes of winning on Nov. 4.      Trailing in opinion polls both nationally and in many key  states, McCain is facing an increasingly difficult path to  victory and finds himself racing to defend states that have  voted Republican in recent elections.      With less than two weeks before the election, Obama leads  McCain 52 percent to 40 percent among likely voters in the  latest three-day tracking poll by Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby.      McCain is resting his hopes on instigating a 'Joe the  Plumber' voter uprising against the better-funded Obama by  whipping up populist sentiment over Obama's comment to Ohio  plumber Joe Wurzelbacher that raising taxes on people making  more than $250,000 a year would allow Washington to 'spread the  wealth around.'      McCain called that redistribution of income and said it  would hurt small businesses responsible for much of the  country's jobs. Some people at his rally were waving 'Joe the  Plumber' T-shirts.      'He's more concerned about using taxes to spread the wealth  than creating a tax plan that creates jobs and grows our  economy,' Arizona Sen. McCain told a cheering throng at an  Ormond Beach lumber yard.      'Sen. Obama is more interested in controlling who gets your  piece of pie than he is in growing the pie,' McCain said.      Illinois Sen. Obama says his tax plan would give 95 percent  of Americans a tax break.      Obama was taking a one-day break from the presidential race  to make a personal journey to see his ailing grandmother in  Hawaii, ceding a day of campaigning to McCain less than two  weeks before the election.           PRIVATE TIME      Obama will spend private time in Honolulu on Friday  visiting Madelyn Dunham, the woman who helped raise him and who  he affectionately calls 'Toot' -- short for 'tutu,' the  Hawaiian word for grandmother.      The 85-year-old Dunham recently broke her hip and is very  ill. Obama said he did not want to repeat the mistake he made  with his mother, who died of cancer before he could reach her  bedside.      McCain was on a bus tour across Florida's 'Interstate 4  corridor,' a 12-county section of Central Florida in which he  needs a large voter turnout on Nov. 4 to save a state that  Republicans have taken in the last two presidential elections.  Polls show a neck-and-neck race in Florida.      In Ormond Beach, McCain strongly supported his vice  presidential running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who has  energized the party's base but has had a difficult introduction  to the national scene, getting mixed reviews for a couple of  national television interviews.      A story in the Politico on Wednesday that the Republican  National Committee spent $150,000 on her wardrobe only added to  the negative picture surrounding Palin.      'My friends, I am so proud of Sarah Palin and what she  represents -- reform and family and all of the things we value.  I'm very proud of her and I know that you are too,' he said.      McCain was sharply critical of Obama of a remark by Obama's  vice presidential running mate, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware,  that Obama is boun",

McCain called Obama's plan a redistribution of income and  said it would hurt small businesses that he said have been  doing some of the only hiring at a time when claims for jobless  benefits rose by a larger than expected 15,000 last week.

Asked about the clothes, McCain told a group of Florida  reporters on his bus that she needed clothes at the time and  that they would be donated to charity, according to WFLA  television.      In Ormond Beach, McCain said it was critical to keep people  facing foreclosure in their homes.      He criticized the Bush administration for not buying  troubled mortgages to allow homeowners facing foreclosure to  get a better interest rate on their loans as part of a $700  billion Wall Street bailout. He complained particularly about  Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.      'Why isn't the secretary of the Treasury ordering them to  do that?' he said.
