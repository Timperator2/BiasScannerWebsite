        "Text": "    LAS VEGAS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Amid growing worries about a  worsening of the U.S. economy, Democratic presidential candidate  Barack Obama proposed a $75 billion economic stimulus plan on  Sunday that includes worker tax credits, a one-time pension  supplement and help for homeowners facing foreclosure.      The plan would include an immediate $250 tax credit to workers  that could double if the economy worsens; a one-time $250  supplement to Social Security retirement payments, a $10 billion  fund to help homeowners facing foreclosure, and a $10 billion fund  to bolster states facing budget shortfalls.      The Illinois senator's office unveiled the proposals while  campaigning in Nevada, which holds the next contested Democratic  primary on Saturday. His leading rival, New York Sen. Hillary  Clinton, also recently unveiled an economic stimulus package.

The plan also includes a $10 billion extension of  unemployment insurance to help those who have been unable to  find a job for more than half a year.      Last year, the senator proposed tax credits of up to $500  for 150 million workers. His revised economic plan calls for  $250 of that to come in an immediate credit, and the rest as  soon as three months later if the nation's unemployment rate  worsens.

        "Text": " (Adds Obama's economic adviser)      By Adam Tanner      LAS VEGAS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Amid growing worries about a  worsening of the U.S. economy, Democratic presidential  candidate Barack Obama proposed a $75 billion economic stimulus  plan on Sunday that includes worker tax credits, a one-time  pension supplement and help to homeowners facing foreclosure.      The plan would include an immediate $250 tax credit for  workers, which could double if the economy worsens, a one-time  $250 supplement to Social Security payments, a $10 billion fund  to help homeowners facing foreclosure and a $10 billion fund to  assist states facing budget shortfalls amid lower tax  revenues.      'We need that middle-class tax cut now more than ever --  not five months from now or five weeks from now, but now,'  Obama said in a statement. 'I'm announcing a plan to jump-start  the economy by putting money in the pockets of those who need  it most and will spend it quickly.'      If he won his party's nomination and then the November  election, Obama would take office in January 2009.      The Illinois senator's office unveiled the proposals at the  start of a day of campaigning in Nevada, which holds the next  contested Democratic primary on Saturday.      The 'goal would be to help the U.S. economy from going into  recession,' his economic advisor Austan Goolsbee told  reporters.      Obama's leading rival, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, on  Friday unveiled an economic stimulus package she said would be  worth $70 billion. Her plan placed more of an emphasis on  helping families unable to make mortgage payments -- a major  issue in Nevada where 'for sale' signs are common on homes  around heavily populated Las Vegas.      'There are some similarities,' Goolsbee said of the two  plans. The biggest difference with Obama's plan is that 'the  absolutely most imperative thing is to get the money into the  people's hands immediately so they can spent it.'      'The stimulus does increase the deficit in the immediate  term,' the economic adviser said, adding that preventing a  recession could have 'profound' budget implications.      The Obama plan also includes a $10 billion extension of  unemployment insurance to help those who have been unable to  find a job for more than six months.      The foreclosure help plan would be aimed at 'responsible  homeowners' who live in their primary residences, Goolsbee  said. Las Vegas has been hit hard by the subprime loan crisis,  but many of those suffering bought additional houses hoping  that fast rising prices amid a prosperous local economy would  lead to easy money.      Last year, Obama proposed tax credits of up to $500 for 150  million workers. His revised economic plan calls for $250 of  that to come in an immediate credit, and the rest as soon as  three months later if the nation's unemployment rate worsens.

'To get people spending again, 95 percent of working  families will receive a $1,000 tax cut -- the first stage of a  middle-class tax cut that I promised during the campaign and  will include in our next budget,' he said in a speech outside  Washington.

        "Text": "    BLUE BELL, Pa., April 21 (Reuters) - Democratic  presidential candidate Barack Obama on Monday criticized a plan  by his Republican rival Sen. John McCain to give U.S. consumers  a temporary break from the federal gasoline tax.      'I've said I think John McCain's proposal for a three-month  tax holiday is a bad idea,' Obama, an Illinois senator, told a   small forum with middle-class voters at a community college      outside Philadelphia.      Obama said that consumers would only see the price cut for  a short time before the costs 'spike right up' again. He also  said there was no guarantee that oil companies would not just  raise prices at the pump by the same amount as the tax cut.      'We're talking about 5 percent of your total cost of gas  that you suspend for three months, which might save you a few  hundred bucks that then will spike right up,' Obama said. 'Now  keep in mind that it will save you that if Exxon Mobil <XOM.N>   doesn't decide, 'we'll just tack on another 5 percent on the current cost.''      Obama added that the money from the gasoline tax is needed  for the federal highway fund.      But Obama said he did not favor an increase in the gasoline  tax.      'Now, I don't want to jack up the cost. I'm not going to  impose an additional tax on gas because consumers just can't  bear it right now,' he said.      Obama is battling Hillary Clinton for the Democratic  nomination and the right to run against McCain, the presumptive  Republican nominee in the general election in November.      McCain last week called for a summer gasoline-tax holiday  for Americans upset over high prices at the pump. The proposal  was part of a broader plan to help the ailing U.S. economy.

        "Text": "    By David Lawder      WASHINGTON, June 11 (Reuters) - Tax breaks proposed by both  presidential hopefuls John McCain and Barack Obama would  increase the U.S. national debt by trillions of dollars over 10  years, but Obama's plan would hike taxes for the wealthiest  Americans, a tax policy group said on Wednesday.      In an analysis of how the candidates' tax proposals would  affect federal revenues, the Brookings Institution and the  Urban Institute said McCain's plans would cut receipts by $3.72  trillion from 2009-2018 compared with current tax law.      Obama's plans would cut revenues by $2.73 trillion over the  same period.      Including added interest costs, McCain's plan would add  $4.5 trillion to the national debt, while Obama's would add  $3.3 trillion -- and that's before spending proposals are  considered.      'It seems really unlikely that they're going to be  balancing the budget,' said Leonard Burman, director of The Tax  Policy Center run by Brookings and the Urban Institute in  Washington, D.C.      The group sought to quantify revenue costs for the tax  break proposals articulated on the campaign trail but assumed  flat spending for each candidate based on this year's budget.      McCain has proposed extending the Bush administration's  2001 and 2003 income and capital gains tax cuts, which are due  to expire at the end of 2010. He also wants to cut the  corporate income tax rate to 25 percent, reduce estate taxes,  increase the exemption for dependents by $500 and allow  businesses to expense purchases of shorter-term equipment.      Obama, meanwhile, would retain portions of the 2001 and  2003 tax cuts that benefit low- and middle-income Americans,  while allowing rates to ratchet back up for the wealthiest  taxpayers. He is also proposing new tax credits for lower  income workers and a home mortgage tax credit for taxpayers who  do not itemize deductions.      Obama also proposes to expand the child and dependent care  tax credit and exempt seniors earning less than $50,000 from  paying federal income taxes.      The analysis assumes both candidates want to permanently  index the alternative minimum tax for inflation to keep it from  ensnaring more middle income taxpayers, at a cost of about $1.1  trillion over 10 years.      The analysis was done before Obama said he wanted to phase  out the alternative minimum tax.      The Tax Policy Center said McCain's plan would provide  effective tax cuts for Americans across the income spectrum,  with the largest percentage increase in after-tax income going  to the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans.      This group, numbering around 150,000, would see their  after-tax income rise by an average of 11.6 percent, or  $678,500, in 2012 as compared with current law that sees tax  cuts expiring at the end of 2010.      The lowest income 20 percent of taxpayers would see an  increase in after-tax income of 0.9 percent, or $101.      Obama's plan takes somewhat the opposite tack, providing  greater percentage tax benefits for lower income groups while  the wealthiest would see tax hikes.      The analysis showed that the lowest-income 20 percent of  taxpayers would see after-tax income increase by 6.2 percent,  or $698 increase, compared with current law, while the top 0.1  percent would see their after-tax incomes decline by 5.1  percent, or $301,400.      Burman said the analysis deliberately left out spending  proposals to focus on the tax side of the equation. He added",

        "Text": "A year after electing Barack Obama president, and five years after his star turn at the Democratic National Convention, we are still trying to figure him out.\n\nIs he a left-wing radical or is he a crowd-pleasing moderate? Is he a uniter? Is he actually religious? Is he a socialist? Does he hate America? And, in light of the confidence he projects, why can\u2019t he seem to take criticism?\n\nBut we could, of course, write that first sentence another way: Only a year after electing Barack Obama president, and we are already trying to figure him out.\n\nRather than it being kind of late to attempt a rigorous analysis of President Obama\u2019s psyche, his political philosophy and his managerial style, perhaps it\u2019s a little too soon. Presidential personalities, after all, develop over time. And the famous saying is true that great leaders aren\u2019t born, but made.\n\nNonetheless, because I\u2019m too young for caution, and too old for fear, I\u2019m more than happy to take a stab at it.\n\nLet me first assuage the fears of many of my conservative friends and colleagues: Barack Obama is not a left-wing radical. He is not a socialist, a communist or a Marxist, and he\u2019s not a black liberation theologist. He\u2019s not un-American, he\u2019s not an atheist, and he\u2019s not a racist.\n\nHe is none of those things, because all would require Barack Obama to have a belief system, a worldview, a set of convictions about political philosophy, theology, and socioeconomics that he simply doesn\u2019t have. He is, instead, empty. He is an empty vessel.\n\nThis will shock and offend his legion of admirers on the left, as it stands in stark contrast to the breathless, leg-thrilling declarations by liberal America that Obama is a deep-thinking, complex, contemplative scholar of soaring intellect, a new kind of leader, exquisitely built for a changing world, who knows the war isn\u2019t between good and evil, but between silence and diplomacy, and for whom indecision is a mark of judicious caution.\n\nBut he\u2019d done nothing to deserve those early accolades, of course. So all of that was pre-ordained and pre-packaged, the result of a coordinated and deliberate campaign by a coalition of marketers, politicos, and members of the press to brand Barack Obama as \u201chope and change\u201d before anyone even knew what his selling points were, or if he actually had any.\n\nThe proof of his ideological emptiness is practically undeniable. He has been, over the short course of his political career, the great abandoner, ever-willing to denounce those ideals that were previously sold to his constituents as \u201chis convictions.\u201d\n\nAfter 20 years in Reverend Wright\u2019s church, he simply got up and left. The man who baptized his children, who was marketed (to black voters in particular) as Obama\u2019s spiritual adviser, who was so integral in shaping Barack Obama\u2019s adult life, that he publicly denounced him, and left his church altogether. And he also denounced black liberation theology, despite giving numerous interviews about the ways in which it had helped shape his religious worldview. After initially defending Rev. Wright, suddenly he and his brand of religion were chucked out the window of a moving campaign bus. He has yet to find a replacement, unsurprisingly, but his interest in evangelicals like Rick Warren and Carey Cash means he is open to the theological polar opposite of Rev. Wright.\n\nThe same sort of dance occurred with other politically inconvenient allies, like domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, Wright apologist Father Michael Pfleger, and convicted felon Tony Rezko. Obama distanced himself from all of them and then eventually dumped them altogether when it became politically necessary. Van Jones was merely a post-election victim of Obama\u2019s willing abandonment. And there have been others.\n\nSo would a real radical disown his radical mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s? Would a real extremist and true-believer insist with a straight face that he didn\u2019t really believe all that stuff? Would a real ideologue be persuaded by a public opinion poll to abandon whole ideology?\n\nActual radicals like Wright and Ayers and Jones defend their beliefs, regardless of the pushback and potential fallout. What Obama did, in contrast, was purely political. Because, despite the insistence by the left that Obama somehow transcends politics, that\u2019s what he is \u2013 a politician. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nWe can also look at the shift in his policy positions over the past few years. He was once quoted as saying that he supported a single-payer health care system. The best political decision now, however, was to abandon that for a more docile public option. Once that failed to garner the groundswell of support his advisers thought it would, he appeared altogether indifferent to it. If he were reallya radical, he\u2019d be rallying us around universal health care right now, not some watered-down 1990-page bureaucratic hodge podge that is neither revolutionary nor practical.\n\nHis impassioned pledges to end \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d close Gitmo, bring troops home, end military tribunals, and myriad other promises, suddenly seem less like the stuff of real political conviction, and more like political headaches that require a clever exit strategy.\n\nAnd his reaction to any kind of opposition \u2013 from the right, from the citizenry, from Fox News \u2013 is equally telling. If Obama\u2019s agenda were based on conviction instead of political expedience and an unquenchable thirst for popularity, criticism would bounce right off him. Instead he seems frighteningly flappable. That\u2019s because leadership without convictions is leadership of empty rhetoric. Convictions can be defended against criticism. Empty rhetoric cannot.\n\nSo why all the radical friends and the radical proposals and the radical rhetoric if he\u2019s not himself a radical? Because his lack of conviction and his inability to forge his own philosophical and theological identity, have made him incredibly susceptible to external influence and pressure. He is easily led. He is, as such, the perfect prospect for someone like Bill Ayers or Reverend Wright, whose radical agendas require vulnerable recruits who are malleable and willing.\n\nI don\u2019t know if President Obama is a man of conviction, if he is a man of faith, or if he is the intellectual giant the left really wants him to be. He very well may be all of those things. But I haven\u2019t seen proof of any of it yet, and neither have you, because there hasn\u2019t been any.\n\nThe only thing we do know for sure, one year after anointing this relative unknown the forty-fourth president of the United States, is that he\u2019s a politician, pure and simple. Calling him a radical gives him way too much credit.\n\nS.E. Cupp is a write and co-author of \"Why You're Wrong About the Right.\" She is a frequent contributor to the Fox Forum.",

        "Text": "This is a rush transcript of \"Special Report With Brit Hume\" from June 10, 2008. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. JOHN MCCAIN, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Under senator Obama's tax plan, Americans of every background would he see their taxes rise \u2014 seniors, parents, small business owners, and just about everyone who has even a modest investment in the market.\n\nSEN. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What we're trying to restore balance, put some money in the pockets of working families, in the pockets of consumers. That, actually, I believe, will be good for business.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBRIT HUME, HOST: Indeed, Senator Obama says that 95 percent of the people in this country would get a tax cut under his program.\n\nSo the debate is now joined between him and McCain, at long distance so far, but we are likely to hear more of it. Some thoughts on it now from Fred Barnes, executive editor of The Weekly Standard; Mort Kondracke, executive editor of Roll Call, and the syndicated columnist, Charles Krauthammer \u2014 FOX News contributors all.\n\nSo what about this debate? It is clearly joined, it is going to be central to this campaign. Who has the high cards, whose doing better, whose argument holds more water, Fred?\n\nFRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I think McCain's does, but that doesn't mean he's winning the debate now. And so far it's a draw.\n\nI think he's going to have to deal with this claim by Obama that he would reduce income taxes, anyway for 95 percent of Americans. When you add in all the other tax increases, all the tax increases in Obama's proposal, I think that is highly unlikely, but McCain has to examine it and make the case.\n\nThe biggest problem I have, and I think most people who in favor of a strong economic rebound, is that Obama does not understand capital gains. Remember when he was asked about the capital gains tax rate in that debate by Charlie Gibson on ABC?\n\nHe was at sea when Gibson said, look, when you raise the rate on capital gains in recent years, it has reduced the revenues that have come in, and when you reduce the rate, as happened in the Clinton administration, you get more revenue.\n\nThat seemed to be a revelation to Obama who then said that at one point, well, maybe we have to raise it because of fairness. It would be harmful to the economy if you raise the capital gains rate, but he would do it for fairness and hurt the economy and jobs, and so on? I think that's where McCain particularly has a vulnerability and he needs to seize it.\n\nHUME: Has a vulnerability in Obama?\n\nBARNES: Yes.\n\nMORT KONDRACKE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ROLL CALL: All of that's true. Obama said he's not a tax and spend liberal, but he is. I mean, he does want to spend an awful lot of money. I was on a conference call today with his economic advisor \u2014\n\nHUME: The word is \"invest.\"\n\nKONDRACKE: Wait, now that you're raising the issue, the country does need some public investment. And you never hear John McCain talk about. That is a bone I have to pick with McCain \u2014 no mention of infrastructure needs which we have to supply, no mention of public education investments, no mention of preschool education, that kind of stuff. Those are legitimate investments.\n\nYou got me off on this track \u2014 and all McCain wants to do is cut discretionary spending. This country will not advance in the world. But the problem is when Republicans add up all the spending and investment proposals and tax cuts that Obama is proposing, it comes to something like $3 trillion over a ten-year period, whereas, if you raise taxes on people over $250,000 a year, it comes to something like $1.5 trillion. That's a big gap, and it will only add to the deficit and the national debt.\n\nCHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: McCain is OK at making this case with a teleprompter, but when he's on his own, all he does is he slogans. He says that Obama is a tax and spend liberal as in the '60's and '70's.\n\nI wouldn't really bring up '60's and '70's, because nobody under 50 remembers the '60's. in fact, there are a lot of people over 50 who don't remember the '60's either for other reasons.\n\nAnd, secondly, the '60's was a time of prosperity. And the '70's, Republicans were in office until January of '77. So it's a hard argument to make.\n\nAnd then he says Obama will be the third Carter campaign. Well, that doesn't really ring a lot because the last Democratic administration was not Carter, but Clinton, and his economy was relatively strong.\n\nI think McCain has to get away \u2014 look, he'll fight Obama to a draw on taxes. But he has to do a bold thing, and I think he can win the economic argument in going after energy and gas. That's what's hurting. That's why Americans are angry \u2014 high gas prices.\n\nHe ought to say, two years ago, with gasoline at $2 a barrel(ph), I was against drilling. Conditions have changed, I have changed. Obama isn't a guy who changes. He is stuck in the past. We have to drill in the artic, we have to drill domestically.\n\nAnd every American understands if you get an American supply, we will be energy independent, and the price will come down. It is a case he can make, the Republicans are making it in Congress, but McCain has disarmed himself.\n\nHUME: Do you think there is any chance McCain would switch on that issue?\n\nKRAUTHAMMER: He's got to.\n\nBARNES: If he has a chance to be president, he might switch.\n\nIf you had united Republicans in Congress with the presidential candidate saying exactly what Charles is saying, that Republicans might thwart the cycle and do better than the otherwise would.\n\nHUME: You think it will take that, though?\n\nBARNES: I think it will.\n\nHUME: Do you agree with that, Mort?\n\nKONDRACKE: Yes. One interesting populist note is McCain is tougher on CEO pay than Obama actually is. McCain actually wants stockholders to approve the CEO's compensation package, whereas Obama just wants to have an advisory vote by stockholders.\n\nSo McCain has the populist ground on that one.\n\nHUME: When we return with our panel, Barack Obama says he will not replace one of his advisors over issues about his mortgages. We'll discuss that further in a moment.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: I am not vetting my V.P. search committee for their mortgages. It is a volunteer, unpaid position. And they're giving me information, and I will then exercise judgment in terms who I want to select as a vice presidential candidate. So these aren't folks who are working for me.\n\nCARLY FIORINA, MCCAIN CAMPAIGN ADVISER: Well, first, I find Barack Obama's statement today that Jim Johnson doesn't work for him naive at best. Of course Jim Johnson works for him.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHUME: Carly Fiorina, a McCain surrogate, responding there to what Barack Obama said today when he had a question put to him about Jim Johnson, whom we spoke about yesterday.\n\nJim Johnson is, of course, the former Mondale campaign chairman and long-time senior Washington Democrat, highly respected man of discretion, and generally believed to be a man of great integrity, headed the search committee, in addition to what he did for Mondale, also for John Kerry a few years ago.\n\nHe was for a number of years, of course, the head of Fannie Mae, at time in which he made a tremendous fortune. And while he was doing that, one of the companies that Fannie Mae did a lot of business with was Countrywide Mortgage, a company Barack Obama has repeatedly and specifically blamed for the nation's mortgage ills and has specifically singled out the former CEO of that company for his criticism.\n\nIt turns out Jim Johnson received some friendly terms loans from that company, Countrywide, and did so because he was a friend of the CEO. So the question arises is he the right guy to be vetting the candidate, and the real question is, are the answers that Barack Obama given to the questions that have been raised about Jim Johnson, someone we all know and have generally liked and admired over the years, are the answers sufficient \u2014 Charles?\n\nKRAUTHAMMER: I don't think it's a Johnson problem, I think it's an Obama problem. Johnson, there is no evidence to date that he has done anything either illegal or improper.\n\nHUME: I know, but is it proper for a guy who is a head of a company, who is farming out business and doing business with another company, to receive loans courtesy \u2014 special loans under a program courtesy of the CEO of the company?\n\nKRAUTHAMMER: But we don't know that there were any conditions that were unusual or favorable. Until that is established, then there is no impropriety.\n\nHUME: OK, got it.\n\nKRAUTHAMMER: The Obama problem is this \u2014 he is the guy who has two affectations. The first is he rises above politics. He is not a guy who is going to do business, he is going to clear the temple of all the insiders. Well, Johnson is an insider, and, by his own standard, he is getting somebody to help him who is what he has been demonizing for the last six months.\n\nHis other affectation, which he shares with other Democrats, is that when you have a national problem, you blame it on corporations and on individuals in those corporations. Senate Democrats are blaming oil prices on the oil companies and gouging. And Obama, he identifies the crisis as a matter of unfair practices by corporations, and he names them, including Countrywide.\n\nSo he is the one who claims that this large issue, which have to do with a lot of other causes, is a matter of misconduct on the part of corporations. Then, by his standard, he shouldn't be having somebody in his employ who has associations of any kind with those corporations, and specifically with the one corporation that he has demonized.\n\nKONDRACKE: He said today in his statement that Jim Johnson was not somebody that he was putting in his administration.\n\nNow, I think that's significant. Jim Johnson is somebody who has been talked about as a possibility for Treasury Secretary, and he certainly does have the qualifications as somebody who knows the financial markets very well to be Treasury Secretary. But if this kind of association is off limits in the Barack Obama administration, then he can't get people who have got any kind of taint at all connected with them. And this cozy deal with an insider that is a pariah now with Obama could be disqualifying.\n\nWhat's more, the fact that \u2014\n\nHUME: So is his answer going to hold up?\n\nKONDRACKE: Obama's? I don't think. I don't think he will have to get rid of Johnson, but he will have to come up with a better explanation than he is just doing this discreet job over here and I have nothing to do with it.\n\nHUME: He doesn't work for me.\n\nKONDRACKE: Yes, exactly. BARNES: And this is, of course, the biggest decision that Obama will make as a candidate, picking his running mate.\n\nHUME: At this stage, anyway.\n\nBARNES: And at this stage Johnson is running that.\n\nThis story is going to die, and, by the way, we don't know how much under market these loans might have been. We do know they were in a special program of Countrywide, the friends of the president of company, got the special treatment.\n\nBut the only way for this story, I think, to continue \u2014 it takes one person to step up and talk very strongly about it, and that's John McCain. His response yesterday was pathetic, and, I mean, he farms out Carly Fiorina. That's not enough.\n\nMcCain has to take it up. If he does, it will have legs. If he doesn't, it's gone.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2008 FOX News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Transcription Copyright 2008 Voxant, Inc.

        "Text": "    Jan 3 (Reuters) - Barack Obama won the Democratic nominating  contest in Iowa on Thursday, a major step in his bid to beat rival  Hillary Clinton and become their party's presidential pick for the  November general election.      Here are five facts about the Illinois Senator who aims to  become the first black president of the United States:           *Obama's father was born and raised in a village in Kenya; his  mother, who was white, grew up in Kansas.           *Obama grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia. He earned his law  degree from Harvard in 1991 and was the first African-American  president of the Harvard Law Review.           *He is married to wife Michelle and has two young  daughters.           *He was a member of the Illinois State Senate before being  elected to the U.S. Senate. His speech at the Democratic  National Convention in 2004 earned him national attention and  acclaim.           *On issues key to many Democratic voters, Obama favors  withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq, reducing carbon emissions to  fight climate change, and eliminating tax breaks from companies  that move jobs overseas.
