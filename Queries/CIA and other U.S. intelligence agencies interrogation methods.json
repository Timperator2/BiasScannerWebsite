        "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The Bush administration  explicitly endorsed the use of waterboarding and other harsh  interrogation methods against al Qaeda suspects in a pair of  secret memos to the CIA in 2003 and 2004, The Washington Post  reported on Wednesday.      The previously undisclosed classified memos were requested  by then CIA Director George Tenet more than a year after the  start of the secret interrogations, the newspaper reported,  citing administration and intelligence officials familiar with  the documents.      A White House spokesman had no comment on the report.      According the newspaper, intelligence officials sought  cover from the White House because they were worried about a  possible backlash if details of the interrogation program  became public.      Justice Department lawyers signed off on the the agency's  interrogation methods beginning in 2002, but senior CIA  officials were troubled that White House policymakers had never  endorsed the program in writing, the Post reported.      Repeated requests by the CIA chief for a paper trail  reflected growing worries within the agency that the  administration might later distance itself from decisions about  the handling of captured al Qaeda leaders, the Post said,  citing former intelligence officials who spoke on condition of  anonymity.      The officials told the newspaper Tenet first pressed the  White House for written approval in June 2003 during a meeting  with members of the National Security Council.      A few days later, Tenet received a brief memo conveying the  administration's approval for the CIA's interrogation methods,  the officials were cited as saying.      Tenet made a second request for written approval in June  2004, after the public outcry over the Abu Ghraib prison  scandal, the Post said.      Administration officials confirmed the existence of the  memos, but neither they nor former intelligence officers would  describe the still classified documents in detail, the  newspaper reported.

        "Text": "    (adds comments by CIA's Hayden to employees)      WASHINGTON, March 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President George W.  Bush on Saturday vetoed legislation passed by Congress that  would have banned the CIA from using waterboarding and other  controversial interrogation techniques.      Lawmakers included the anti-torture measure in a broader  bill authorizing U.S. intelligence activities.      'Because the danger remains, we need to ensure our  intelligence officials have all the tools they need to stop the  terrorists,' Bush said in his weekly radio address. He added  that the vetoed legislation 'would diminish these vital  tools.'      The House of Representatives approved the legislation in  December and the Senate passed it in February despite White  House warnings it would be vetoed.      CIA Director Michael Hayden told Congress last month that  government interrogators used waterboarding on three suspects  captured after the Sept. 11 attacks.      The simulated drowning technique has been condemned by many  members of Congress, human rights groups and other countries as  a form of illegal torture.      The U.S. Army Field Manual prohibits waterboarding and  seven other interrogation methods and the bill would have  aligned CIA practices with the military's.      In a message to CIA employees on Saturday after Bush's  veto, Hayden said the CIA would continue to work strictly  within the law but said its needs were different from that of  the U.S. Army and that the CIA needed to follow its own  procedures.      'There are methods in CIA's program that have been briefed  to our oversight committees, are fully consistent with the  Geneva Convention and current U.S. law, and are most certainly  not torture,' Hayden said.      In his remarks, Bush did not specifically mention  waterboarding.      But he said: 'The bill Congress sent me would not simply  ban one particular interrogation method, as some have implied.   Instead, it would eliminate all the alternative procedures  we've developed to question the world's most dangerous and  violent terrorists.'      It is unlikely that Democrats, the majority party in  Congress, could muster enough votes to overturn Bush's veto.  The bill passed the House and Senate on partisan votes, short  of the support needed to reverse the president.

        "Text": "    NEW YORK, May 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ordered the  Central Intelligence Agency on Thursday to submit to the court  a 2002 memo said to specify harsh interrogation methods used on  suspected terrorists held abroad.      The American Civil Liberties Union said the memo was  written by the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel  and sent to the CIA in August 2002. The ACLU described the memo  as 'one of the most important torture documents still being  withheld by the Bush administration.'      In a copy of the order posted on the ACLU's Web site, Judge  Alvin Hellerstein told the government to produce the memo so he  can determine whether it should be made public as part of a  lawsuit the ACLU and other organizations filed in June 2004  requesting records concerning the treatment of prisoners in  U.S. custody abroad.      Hellerstein has scheduled a review of the document for  Monday.      'This memo authorized the CIA to use specific torture  techniques -- including waterboarding,' Jameel Jaffer, ACLU's  national security project director, said in a statement.      'CIA agents waterboarded prisoners because this memo told  them that they could,' he said. 'The memo is being withheld not  for legitimate security reasons, but in order to protect  government officials from accountability for their decisions.'      Waterboarding is a simulated drowning technique.      The ACLU said more than 100,000 pages of government  documents have been released in response to its lawsuit.      Among those was a declassified 2003 memo, released by the  U.S. Justice Department on April 1, that justified the use of  harsh interrogation methods for suspected terrorists held  abroad.      A subsequent decision overruled the memo, which said  President George W. Bush's authority as commander-in-chief  superseded international law regarding wartime interrogations.      The U.S. military has banned the use of waterboarding and  other harsh methods considered by some rights advocates to be  torture. The U.S. intelligence community has not.      Bush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding after the  Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, but he has repeatedly insisted that  the United States does not torture prisoners.      The CIA has said it used waterboarding during the  interrogations of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who faces murder  charges in the U.S. military court at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

        "Text": " (Adds reaction, analysis)      By Andy Sullivan      WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - President-elect Barack Obama  has chosen former White House chief of staff Leon Panetta to  lead the CIA, which has been widely criticized for harsh  interrogation of terrorism suspects, Democratic officials said  on Monday.      The surprise pick of Panetta for Central Intelligence  Agency director was one of the last major nominations for the  incoming Obama administration, which takes over from President  George W. Bush on Jan. 20.      Panetta has relatively little experience in national  security matters, though he did participate in daily  intelligence briefings with President Bill Clinton when he  served as Clinton's chief of staff between 1994 and 1997.      He is best known as a budget expert who tamed deficits in  the White House and during a prior 16-year stint in Congress.      He was a member of the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan  commission that was charged with assessing a way to end the  Iraq war. Its recommendations for a phased troop withdrawal  were largely ignored by the Bush administration, which chose to  increase the U.S. military presence there instead.      Intelligence experts said Panetta's knowledge of the inner  workings of government, and his strong bipartisan reputation  for fairness, would prove valuable.      'It was a surprise, but I think he will prove to be a  valuable pick,' said a source with close ties to U.S.  intelligence.      Panetta would succeed Michael Hayden, who has been  criticized by some Democrats and human rights groups for his  defense of Bush administration counterterrorism tactics. Hayden  has sought to restore stability at the spy agency.        CIA CONTROVERSIES      The CIA has been at the center of a number of major  controversies during Bush's presidency, beginning with the  intelligence failures before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and  then the faulty prewar intelligence about Iraq's weapons  programs.      The agency also has been criticized for the use of  waterboarding, or simulated drowning, and other harsh  interrogation methods on al Qaeda suspects, for the secret  transfer of captured terrorism suspects to countries known to  use torture and for the use of secret prisons overseas for  high-level captives.      Obama has vowed to 'put a clear end to torture' and restore  a balance between security and constitutional protections.      'The CIA still is in a politically fragile moment,' said  Princeton professor Julian Zelizer. 'Bringing a politically  skilled person into this position can help the CIA revitalize  its political standing.'      The position of CIA director is not as influential as it  used to be after the creation in 2004 of a Director of National  Intelligence to oversee all U.S. intelligence agencies.      Sources say Obama has picked retired Navy Adm. Dennis Blair  to fill that position.      After leaving the White House, Panetta has directed a  public policy center at California State University, Monterey  and served in other positions within California's state  university system. He has also sat on a number of corporate and  nonprofit boards.      Panetta's choice could appease some liberal activists who  have said that Obama's other picks for key national-security  posts are too hawkish and insufficiently antiwar.      Obama has picked retired Marine Gen. James Jones for his  national security adviser and has asked current Defense  Secretary Robert Gates to remain in c",

        "Text": "    By Alonso Soto      QUITO, April 5 (Reuters) - Ecuador's leftist president on  Saturday accused the CIA of controlling many of his country's  spy agencies and said it had shared Ecuadorean intelligence  with U.S. ally Colombia during last month's regional crisis.      'Many of our intelligence agencies have been taken over by  the CIA,' Rafael Correa said during his weekly radio show.  'Through the CIA, information found here was passed to Colombia  to improve their position' in the dispute.      Ecuador broke off diplomatic ties with Bogota after  Colombian forces attacked a rebel camp inside Ecuadorean  territory, killing a top guerrilla leader and more than 20  other people.      The bombing raid raised the specter of war after Ecuador  and Venezuela briefly sent troops to their borders with  Colombia. Nerves quickly calmed during a regional meeting.      But the recent confirmation that an Ecuadorean died in the  March 1 raid has renewed tensions between the neighbors.      Correa charged the United States with financing some  officers in the Ecuadorean spy agencies and said reforms to the  Andean country's intelligence were needed.      A close ally of U.S. foe Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez,  Correa said he hoped the diplomatic spat would be over soon,  but warned of legal actions against Colombia for the killing of  the Ecuadorean citizen who was in the rebel camp.      Correa added that Ecuador's decision on to sue Colombia in  international court over Colombia's anti-drug spraying along  its border was in retaliation for the raid.      The suit filed on Monday has again strained relations  between the neighbors who share a 400-mile (600 km) border  often crossed by rebels fighting a four-decade war against the  Colombian government.      Correa, whose popularity has rebounded for his handling of  the dispute, is a critic of U.S. foreign policy in Latin  America.      He has said U.S. President George W. Bush was worse than  Satan and once vowed to cut off his arm before renewing a lease  that allows U.S. troops to use a key anti-drug air base.

        "Text": "    NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - Recent letters from the  Justice Department to Congress state that U.S. intelligence  agents working to prevent terror attacks can legally use  interrogation techniques banned by international law, The New  York Times reported on Sunday.      President George W. Bush issued an executive order last  summer in which he said the CIA would observe international  regulations regarding detainee treatment. The letters indicate  the Bush administration now contends these boundaries may be  stretched in some interrogations.      A March 5 letter from the Justice Dept. to Congress makes  clear the Bush administration has not defined which  interrogation methods might violate the Geneva Convention's  bans on 'outrages upon personal dignity,' the Times said.      The letters were provided by the staff of Sen. Ron Wyden,  an Oregon Democrat and member of the Senate Intelligence  Committee. The panel received classified briefings on the  matter and Wyden requested further information, which yielded  the letters, the Times said.      'The fact that an act is undertaken to prevent a threatened  terrorist attack, rather than for the purpose of humiliation or  abuse, would be relevant to a reasonable observer in measuring  the outrageousness of the act,' wrote Brian Benczkowski, a  deputy assistant attorney general, in one letter.      A senior Justice Department official, speaking on condition  of anonymity, said of the classified information: 'I certainly  don't want to suggest that if there's a good purpose you can  head off and humiliate someone.'      But, he said, 'the fact that you are doing something for a  legitimate security purpose would be relevant ... There are  certainly things that can be insulting that would not raise to  the level of an outrage on personal dignity.'      The Geneva Conventions prohibit humiliating and degrading  treatment of prisoners.

The CIA last month disclosed that it had destroyed in 2005  hundreds of hours of tapes from the interrogations of two al  Qaeda suspects, prompting an outcry from Democrats, human  rights activists and some legal experts.      The interrogations, which took place in 2002, were believed  to have included a form of simulated drowning known as  waterboarding, condemned internationally as torture.      President George W.

        "Text": " (Recast, adds U.S. Embassy reaction and details)      By Alonso Soto      QUITO, April 5 (Reuters) - Ecuador's president accused the  CIA on Saturday of controlling many of his country's spy  agencies, in comments that could fray ties with Washington and  drag it into Ecuador's feud with neighboring Colombia.      President Rafael Correa has fired a top intelligence  officer and plans to overhaul spy agencies for belatedly  informing him about links between Colombian rebels and an  Ecuadorean who died in Colombia's raid inside Ecuador last  month that sparked a regional crisis.      'Many of our intelligence agencies have been taken over by  the CIA,' the leftist leader said during his weekly radio show.  'Through the CIA, information found here was passed to Colombia  to improve their position' in the dispute.      Correa also charged the United States with financing some  officers in the Ecuadorean spy agencies.      U.S. Embassy spokesman in Quito Arnaldo Arbesu declined to  comment on the charges but said, 'We are always willing to work  with the Ecuadorean government in any type of issue.'      Correa, whose popularity has rebounded for his handling of  the dispute and is an ally of U.S. foe Venezuelan leader Hugo  Chavez, is a critic of U.S. foreign policy in Latin America.      He has called U.S. President George W. Bush worse than  Satan, and once vowed to cut off his own arm before renewing a  lease that allows U.S. troops to use a key anti-drug air base.      The March 1 raid, which killed a Colombian rebel leader and  more than 20 other people, raised the threat of war after  Ecuador and Venezuela briefly sent troops to their borders with  Colombia. Nerves quickly calmed during a regional meeting a  week later.      Correa said he hoped the diplomatic spat would be over  soon, but warned of legal actions against Colombia for the  killing of the Ecuadorean citizen who was in the rebel camp.      Correa added that Ecuador's decision to sue Colombia in  international court over Colombia's anti-drug spraying along  its border was in response to the raid.      The suit filed on Monday has once again strained relations  between the neighbors who share a 400-mile (600-km) border  often crossed by rebels fighting a four-decade war against the  Colombian government.

        "Text": " (Adds Hayden quote, comments by FBI, national intelligence  director, background)      By Randall Mikkelsen      WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The CIA used a widely  condemned interrogation technique known as waterboarding on  three suspects captured after the Sept. 11 attacks, CIA  Director Michael Hayden told Congress on Tuesday.      'Waterboarding has been used on only three detainees,'  Hayden told the Senate Intelligence Committee. It was the first  time a U.S. official publicly specified the number of people  subjected to waterboarding and named them.      Critics call waterboarding a form of illegal torture.  Congress is considering banning the technique.      Those subjected to waterboarding were suspected Sept. 11  mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and senior al Qaeda leaders  Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, Hayden said at the  hearing on threats to the United States.      He said waterboarding has not been used in five years.      'The circumstances are different than they were in late  2001, early 2002,' Hayden said. 'Very critical to those  circumstances was the belief that additional catastrophic  attacks against the homeland were imminent. In addition to  that, my agency ... had limited knowledge about al Qaeda and  its workings. Those two realities have changed.'      Hayden told reporters later that the interrogations of  Mohammed and Zubaydah were particularly fruitful.      From the time of their capture in 2002 and 2003 until they  were delivered to Guantanamo Bay prison in 2006, the two  suspects accounted for one-fourth of the human intelligence  reports on al Qaeda, Hayden said.      Some analysts have questioned Mohammed's credibility under  interrogation. But Hayden said most of the information was  reliable and helped lead to other al Qaeda suspects.      He told the committee he opposed limiting the CIA to using  interrogation techniques permitted in the U.S. Army Field  Manual, which bans waterboarding. CIA interrogators are better  trained, and the agency works with a narrower range of suspects  in its interrogations, he said.           HARSH TACTICS      Hayden said fewer than 100 people had been held in the  CIA's terrorism detention and interrogation program launched  after the Sept. 11 attacks, with fewer than one-third of them  subjected to any harsh interrogation techniques.      But applying the field manual's limitations to the CIA, he  said, 'would substantially increase the danger to America.'      The CIA is the only U.S. agency that uses harsh  interrogation techniques, National Intelligence Director  Michael McConnell told the hearing. The entire military adheres  to the Army Field Manual and FBI Director Robert Mueller told  the hearing his agency does not use coercive techniques.      A senior intelligence official said after the hearing that  it was unclear whether the CIA could legally use waterboarding  in the future, given changes in U.S. law. The Bush  administration says it neither uses nor condones torture.      The CIA said in December that it had destroyed videotapes  depicting the interrogations of Zubaydah and Nashiri, prompting  a Justice Department investigation.

        "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - President George W. Bush said  on Thursday he strongly supports a Justice Department  investigation into the destruction of CIA videotapes of  interrogation of terrorism suspects, and that the White House  would cooperate.      'I strongly support it. And we will participate,' Bush said  in a Reuters interview.      It was his first public comment since the Justice  Department said on Wednesday it had launched a criminal  investigation into the CIA's destruction of videotapes showing  harsh interrogation of terrorism suspects.      Asked whether he had any concerns that the probe might  raise questions about his couterterrorism policy, Bush replied:  'See what it says. See what the investigation leads to.'      The Central Intelligence Agency last month disclosed that  in 2005 it destroyed hundreds of hours of tapes from the  interrogations of two al Qaeda suspects, prompting an outcry  from Democrats, human rights activists and some legal experts.      The interrogations, which took place in 2002, were believed  to have included a form of simulated drowning known as  waterboarding, condemned internationally as torture.      Bush has said the United States does not torture but has  declined to be specific about interrogation methods.

        "Text": " (Adds Sen. Durbin, Human Rights Watch)      By Randall Mikkelsen      WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The CIA used a widely  condemned interrogation technique known as waterboarding on  three suspects captured after the Sept. 11 attacks, CIA  Director Michael Hayden told Congress on Tuesday.      'Waterboarding has been used on only three detainees,'  Hayden told the Senate Intelligence Committee. It was the first  time a U.S. official publicly specified the number of people  subjected to waterboarding and named them.      Congress is considering banning the simulated drowning  technique. A Democratic senator and a human rights advocacy  group urged a criminal investigation after Hayden made his  remarks.      'Waterboarding is torture, and torture is a crime,' Human  Rights Watch said in a statement.      Those subjected to waterboarding were suspected Sept. 11  mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and senior al Qaeda leaders  Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, Hayden said at the  Senate hearing on threats to the United States.      He said waterboarding has not been used in five years.      'The circumstances under which we are operating ... are  frankly, different than they were in late 2001 and early 2002,'  Hayden said. 'Very critical to those circumstances was the  belief that additional catastrophic attacks against the  homeland were imminent. In addition to that, my agency ... had  limited knowledge about al Qaeda and its workings. Those two  realities have changed.'      Hayden told reporters later that the interrogations of  Mohammed and Zubaydah were particularly fruitful.      From the time of their capture in 2002 and 2003 until they  were delivered to Guantanamo Bay prison in 2006, the two  suspects accounted for one-fourth of the human intelligence  reports on al Qaeda, Hayden said.      Some analysts have questioned Mohammed's credibility under  interrogation. But Hayden said most of the information was  reliable and helped lead to other al Qaeda suspects.      He told the committee he opposed limiting the CIA to using  interrogation techniques permitted in the U.S. Army Field  Manual, which bans waterboarding. CIA interrogators are better  trained, and the agency works with a narrower range of suspects  in its interrogations, he said.           HARSH TACTICS      Hayden said fewer than 100 people had been held in the  CIA's terrorism detention and interrogation program launched  after the Sept. 11 attacks, with fewer than one-third of them  subjected to any harsh interrogation techniques.      But applying the field manual's limitations to the CIA, he  said, 'would substantially increase the danger to America.'      The CIA is the only U.S. agency that uses harsh  interrogation techniques, National Intelligence Director  Michael McConnell told the hearing. The entire military adheres  to the Army Field Manual and FBI Director Robert Mueller told  the hearing his agency does not use coercive techniques.      A senior intelligence official said after the hearing that  it was unclear whether the CIA could legally use waterboarding  in the future, given changes in U.S. law. The Bush  administration says it neither uses nor condones torture.      Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and judiciary  committee member, demanded that Attorney General Michael  Mukasey investigate the CIA waterboarding and vowed to delay  the nomination for Mukasey's deputy until the attorney general  responds to that and other issues.

        "Text": " (Adds additional background)      By Andy Sullivan      WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - President-elect Barack Obama  has chosen former White House chief of staff Leon Panetta to  lead the CIA, which has been widely criticized for harsh  interrogation of terrorism suspects, Democratic officials said  on Monday.      The choice of Panetta for Central Intelligence Agency   director was one of the last major nominations for the incoming  Obama administration, which takes over from President George W.  Bush on Jan. 20.      Panetta has relatively little experience in national  security matters. He is best known for imposing order on  President Bill Clinton's White House during his 1994-1997 stint  as chief of staff and taming budget deficits while there and  during his prior 16-year tenure in Congress.      He was a member of the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan  commission that was charged with assessing a way to end the  Iraq war. Its recommendations for a phased troop withdrawal  were largely ignored by the Bush administration, which chose to  increase the U.S. military presence there instead.      Panetta would succeed Michael Hayden, who has been  criticized by some Democrats and human rights groups for his  defense of Bush administration counterterrorism tactics. Hayden  has sought to restore stability at the spy agency.      The CIA has been at the center of a number of major  controversies during Bush's presidency, beginning with the  intelligence failures before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and  then the faulty prewar intelligence about Iraq's weapons  programs.      The CIA also has been criticized for the use of harsh  interrogation methods, including waterboarding, on al Qaeda  suspects, for the secret transfer of captured terrorism  suspects to countries known to use torture and for the use of  secret prisons overseas for high-level captives.      Obama has vowed to 'put a clear end to torture' and  'restore' a balance between security and constitutional  protections.      After leaving the White House, Panetta has directed a  public policy center at California State University, Monterey  and served in other positions within California's state  university system. He has also sat on a number of corporate and  nonprofit boards.      Panetta's choice could appease some liberal activists who  have said that Obama's other picks for key national-security  posts are too hawkish and insufficiently antiwar.      Sources say Obama has named retired Navy Adm. Dennis Blair  to be the top U.S. intelligence official, who would oversee the  CIA and other arms of the U.S. intelligence apparatus.      He has also picked retired Marine Gen. James Jones to be  national security adviser and has asked current Defense  Secretary Robert Gates to remain in charge at the Pentagon.

        "Text": "    By Randall Mikkelsen      WASHINGTON, May 16 (Reuters) - The FBI is helping to get  information from detainees and prepare terrorism cases against  suspects at Guantanamo Bay, despite differences with the CIA  over harsh interrogation techniques, the bureau's director said  on Friday.      But, in an appearance at the National Press Club, Federal  Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller declined to say  whether a single U.S. interrogation standard was needed to  prohibit coercive tactics like waterboarding, a form of  simulated drowning widely criticized as torture.      'The policy of the bureau ... is not to use coercion,' he  said. 'I will speak for the FBI.'      Mueller spoke before the release of a Justice Department  inspector general's report on the FBI's role in harsh  questioning of detainees, which is expected as early as  Tuesday. A U.S. military commission is also preparing to try  several terrorism suspects held at the U.S. Naval Base on  Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.      Mueller was asked whether the FBI was still interrogating  'enemy combatants' in cases of suspected terrorism and at what  point agents would leave the room to avoid taking part in  coercive techniques.      'We still are participating in the preparation of cases in  Guantanamo, and yes we are participating in debriefings  elsewhere in the world, but I'm not going to get into details,'  he said.      FBI agents are known to have objected to the questioning of  detainees at Guantanamo, but critics say they should have  sought to stop abuses.      President George W. Bush vetoed a bill in March that would  have banned waterboarding by the CIA.      At a congressional hearing in February, CIA Director  Michael Hayden acknowledged that three foreign terrorism  suspects had been subjected to waterboarding five years  earlier. The technique was used under the agency's detention  and interrogation program launched after the Sept. 11.      Mueller told the same hearing the FBI did not use coercion,  and Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell said  the CIA was the only U.S. agency that uses harsh techniques.      Hayden said the CIA's questioning sought to uncover  impending attacks, unlike the FBI's job before the Sept. 11  attacks, which was to gather evidence of past crimes.      FBI spokesman Richard Kolko said the bureau works with  other U.S. intelligence agencies but follows its own  guidelines. 'In coordination with our intelligence community  partners, and in accordance with those guidelines and policies,  the FBI conducts interviews of potential terrorism subjects in  different locations,' he said.

        "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President-elect Barack Obama  on Friday named retired Adm. Dennis Blair to oversee U.S. spy  agencies as director of national intelligence, and chose former  White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta as CIA director.      Following are some of the major challenges the two would  face if confirmed by the Senate.           CLOSING GUANTANAMO - Obama has pledged to close the prison  for terrorism suspects at the U.S. Naval base at Guantanamo  Bay, Cuba, a global symbol of U.S. detainee abuses in the war  on terrorism. But the spy chiefs must help decide how to  replace it and how to revise detention and interrogation  practices in keeping with Obama's vows for more humane  policies.           CATCHING OSAMA BIN LADEN - Officials of the outgoing Bush  administration say with growing confidence that al Qaeda's  central leadership has been largely neutralized. But bin Laden  and his second-in-command, Ayman al Zawahri, remain at large  more than seven years after the Sept. 11 attacks they  masterminded.           MONITORING IRAN - U.S. spy agencies shifted gears in  December 2007 with a national intelligence estimate that  concluded Iran had stopped developing a nuclear warhead. Some  critics of Iran said the report understated its threat and  undermined a U.S.-led international campaign against Iran's  nuclear program. Congress and others will be watching closely  to see whether any new intelligence merits updating the  estimate.          SECURITY OVERHAUL - Blair and two other intended senior  members of Obama's security team have served on the Project for  National Security Reform, which last November released a  500-page blueprint for overhauling the U.S. security system  across government, and they are likely to bring those ideas  with them. Among the recommendations are to combine the White  House National Security Council and Homeland Security Council,  which the Obama team is known to be considering.           WORKING TOGETHER - The Office of the Director of National  Intelligence -- created in response to intelligence failures  that contributed to the Sept. 11 attacks and Iraq war -- is  relatively new and assumes some duties once held by the CIA.  The effectiveness of the two agencies depends on a strong  working relationship, but how to ensure that and prevent  rivalries is still being worked out.

        "Text": "    By Randall Mikkelsen      WASHINGTON, July 16 (Reuters) - The White House threatened  to veto legislation on Wednesday that would bar CIA contractors  from interrogating suspected terrorists, in the latest debate  over treatment of detainees in the U.S.-declared war on  terrorism.      The White House issued the threat in a notice to Congress  as the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives began  considering a broad measure to authorize funding of U.S.  intelligence activities for the 2009 fiscal year.      The Bush administration also objected to several other  provisions in the multibillion-dollar bill.      They include the establishment of an inspector general with  authority over all federal intelligence agencies and  requirements that the president give Congress more sensitive  national security information.      In addition to such oversight measures, the bill also would  increase funding for intelligence agents and to monitor issues  in Asia, Africa and Latin America.      The bill contains many provisions 'that conflict with the  conduct of intelligence activities,' the White House budget  office told Congress. 'If (the bill) were presented to the  president, the president's senior advisors would recommend that  he veto the bill.'      The contractor provision was the first objection listed by  the White House.      CIA Director Michael Hayden has acknowledged that outside  contractors were used to conduct some interrogations in the  agency's detention program for suspected terrorists, which has  been widely condemned for harsh techniques that critics say  amount to torture.      He told Congress in February he believed contractors helped  conduct 'waterboarding,' the fiercely condemned simulated  drowning technique that he acknowledged using on three al Qaeda  suspects.      Critics say the use of outside contractors could allow the  CIA to dodge accountability for abuses, but the agency has said  contractors are subject to the same laws as agency staffers.      'Our bill will take detention-related activities out of the  hands of private contractors and put the responsibility back  where it belongs, in the hands of authorized government  personnel,' U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, a California Democrat,  said shortly before the House Intelligence Committee passed the  authorization measure in May.      The panel passed the bill on a voice vote with broad  bipartisan support.      But the White House said prohibiting contract interrogators  could deprive the program of necessary questioning skills and  expertise.      'Such a provision would unduly limit the United States'  ability to obtain intelligence needed to protect Americans from  attack,' it said.      The Senate Intelligence Committee passed in May its version  the bill, which also contains a ban on CIA interrogation  contractors. It also would ban CIA harsh interrogations and  require that the Red Cross be granted access to all detainees.      The measure awaits action by the full Senate. Differences  between the House and Senate versions would have be resolved  before any final measure is passed.      Major funding provisions of the intelligence bill are  classified. Last year the the administration bowed to a law  ordering disclosure of the annual intelligence budget and said  it had spent $43.5 billion in fiscal 2007. The law also  requires disclosure of spending in fiscal 2008, which ends in  September, but the U.S. president can waive the requirement  after",

        "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The CIA on three occasions  shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks used a widely condemned  interrogation technique known as waterboarding, CIA Director  Michael Hayden told Congress on Tuesday.      'Waterboarding has been used on only three detainees,'  Hayden told the Senate Intelligence Committee, publicly  specifying the number of subjects and naming them for the first  time, as Congress considers banning the technique.      Those subjected to waterboarding were al Qaeda suspects  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim  al-Nashiri, Hayden said.      He said waterboarding has not been used in five years, but  it was used then because of concerns of imminent catastrophic  attacks on the United States and because authorities had  limited knowledge of al Qaeda.      'The circumstances are different than they were in late  2001, early 2002,' Hayden said.      He said he opposed limiting the CIA to using interrogation  techniques permitted in the U.S. Army Field Manual, which bans  waterboarding. CIA interrogators are better trained, and it  works with a narrower range of suspects in its interrogations,  he said.      Hayden told the committee fewer than 100 people had been  held in the CIA's terrorism detention and interrogation  program, with fewer than one-third of them subjected to any  coercive interrogation techniques.      The CIA said in December that it had destroyed videotapes  depicting the interrogations of Zubaydah and Nashiri, prompting  a Justice Department investigation.
