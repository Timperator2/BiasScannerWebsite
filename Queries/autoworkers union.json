Ken Lewenza, president of the union that represents 33,000  autoworkers, said he was happy that the restructuring plans  submitted by the two companies to the Canadian and Ontario  governments did not contain any new bad news for his members.

        "Text": "    TORONTO, June 12 (Reuters) - The fate of the blockade of  General Motors of Canada's <GM.N> headquarters in Oshawa,  Ontario by the Canadian Auto Workers union, now in its ninth  day, is in the hands of a judge on Thursday.      GM is arguing for an injunction to end the action and for  C$1.5 million ($1.47 million) in compensation from the Oshawa  local of the CAW and five of its members.      Shortly after the case began in a Whitby, Ontario, court  room, several hundred Canadian autoworkers and their supporters  kicked off a 'solidarity' rally near the Oshawa truck plant  that GM plans to close late next year.      The plant, which employs 2,600 union members, is one of  four in North America GM plans to shutter as it shifts its  focus to producing more fuel efficient vehicles in response to  changing customer demand as gasoline prices soar.      GM announced the September 2009 closure about a  week-and-a-half ago, just two weeks after it signed a  three-year labor agreement with the CAW in which it said it  would keep the plant open until 2011.      That set off cries of betrayal from the union and the  blockade of GM Canada's headquarters, which has forced about  1,000 GM office staff to work from home.      A high-level meeting between CAW leadership and top GM  officials in Detroit last Friday was fruitless, the union  said.      The CAW ramped up its protests the following day, halting  production at GM's Oshawa complex for about 45 minutes by way  of a convoy of hundreds of cars that slowly circled the plants,  preventing shipments from coming or going.      Aside from the truck plant, which produces the Chevrolet  Silverado and the GMC Sierra, the complex includes a car plant  where the Chevrolet Impala is currently built and the Camaro is  set to begin production. The province of Ontario has said it is  in discussions with GM about adding a third car to that line.

        "Text": "    By Tom Doggett      WASHINGTON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate took on the  role of Christmas Grinch for autoworkers when it failed on  Thursday to pass a $14 billion rescue package for Detroit's  three major car manufacturers.      Attention now turns to the Bush administration's Treasury  Department, who Reid and other supporters of a bailout said  should dip into the $700 billion fund Congress created to help  Wall Street firms and banks, and lend automakers the money they  need to avoid bankruptcy and save millions of jobs.      The Senate late on Thursday came only a few 'yes' votes  short of the 60 needed to block a filibuster on the bailout  bill, effectively killing any chance of Congress providing a  lifeline to the financially drowning automakers this year.      'It's going to be a very, very bad Christmas for a lot of  people based on what takes place here tonight,' Senate Majority  Leader Harry Reid told his colleagues before the vote. 'It's  over with.'      A Treasury Department official declined to comment on the  Senate's failure to approve the rescue package and said it was  up to the White House to respond.      White House spokesman Tony Fratto said the administration  would evaluate its options 'in light of the breakdown in  Congress,' saying the legislation had 'presented the best  chance to avoid a disorderly bankruptcy while ensuring taxpayer  funds only go to firms whose stakeholders were prepared to make  difficult decisions to become viable.'      Markets across the Asia-Pacific region were down more than  3 percent after news the talks had collapsed, with Japan's  Nikkei average and Hong Kong's Hang Seng both down more than 5  percent.      U.S. crude oil prices fell more $2 toward $45 a barrel on  news of the bailout bust.      Senators negotiated late into the night on a possible  compromise that participants said fell apart over proposed wage  concessions by the powerful United Auto Workers union.      'We were three words away from a deal,' said Sen. Bob    Corker, a Tennessee Republican who proposed the alternative and  led the talks.      Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, said the  main issue of disagreement was the date to require the Detroit  autoworkers' pay parity with foreign-based U.S. auto  manufacturers.      General Motors Corp <GM.N> and Chrysler LLC are seeking  billions of dollars in immediate aid, while Ford Motor Co <F.N>  wants a hefty line of credit.      The industry is reeling from depressed sales, made worse by  the credit crunch and the recession and GM and Chrysler said  government intervention was required now to avert potential  failure.      The House of Representatives passed its version of a  Democratic-sponsored bailout on Wednesday, but Senate  Republicans rejected that measure.

        "Text": "    By Doug Palmer      WASHINGTON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - U.S. autoworkers and  troubled automaker Chrysler urged Congress on Wednesday not to  approve a free trade pact with South Korea until it has been  renegotiated to address their concerns.      The deal struck in April 2007 by the Bush administration  'would threaten the jobs of tens of thousands of American  workers, exacerbating the already serious difficulties facing  the U.S. auto industry and its workers and retirees,' said Ron  Gettelfinger, president of the United Auto Workers union.      Gettelfinger told the Senate Commerce Committee the  agreement fails to tear down South Korean regulatory barriers  that have long thwarted sales of U.S. and other foreign cars,  even though South Korea would be required to immediately  eliminate its tariffs on U.S. cars and trucks.      John Bozzella, Chrysler's vice president for external  affairs and public policy, said the agreement 'narrows, but  does not eliminate discrimination against U.S. auto importers'  in South Korea and rewards that country for failing to live up  to previous auto trade deals.      The warnings came on the same day the U.S. House of  Representatives approved $25 billion in loans to help Chrysler,  Ford <F.N> and General Motors <GM.N> through current hard  times. That legislation now goes to the Senate for a vote.      Last year, South Korea exported 668,000 autos to the United  States, but imported only 6,500 U.S. vehicles      Presidential Democratic candidate Barack Obama has promised  to negotiate the trade deal if elected. His Republican rival  John McCain has urged approval of the pact.      The agreement enjoys broad support outside the auto sector  from many farm and business groups eager to increase sales in  South Korea's $1 trillion economy.      Myron Brilliant, president of the U.S.-Korea Business  Council, said the pact does tackle many 'non-tariff barriers'  the U.S. auto sector has long complained about.      South Korea also pledged not to 'discourage the purchase or  use of U.S. goods or services -- an important commitment in  light of the past anti-import campaigns in Korea,' he said.      The U.S. International Trade Commission has estimated the  agreement would likely have a 'negligible' effect on overall  U.S. auto trade, Brilliant said.      The independent trade panel forecast auto imports from  South Korea would increase under the pact, but said most gains  would come at the expense of other foreign suppliers.      The Bush administration still hopes lawmakers will approve  the agreement this year in a possible lame duck session of  Congress after the Nov. 4 elections.      Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Bryon Dorgan, a North  Dakota Democrat and foe of Bush administration trade deals,  said lawmakers would not approve the pact in 2008.      'I believe unless it's modified in a very substantial way  it's not going to be approved by any Congress,' Dorgan said.

        "Text": "    TORONTO, June 4 (Reuters) - Angry autoworkers blockaded the  entrance to General Motors of Canada <GM.N> headquarters in  Oshawa, Ontario on Wednesday, one day after GM said it would  shut its Oshawa truck plant.      'We're not allowing any GM of Canada employees to enter the  headquarters building,' said Chris Buckley, of the Canadian  Auto Workers union, which says 2,600 jobs will go if the truck  plant closes.      'We are going to stay here until General Motors reverses  the decision they made yesterday, or at the very least commits  to a product for the Oshawa truck plant, or sits down  face-to-face with this union to try to explain why they have  broken our brand new agreement.'      TV pictures showed some 100 autoworkers on a road leading  to the Oshawa plant, which is to be closed as GM tries to shore  up a restructuring plan that has been overtaken by a steep  decline in U.S. sales of pickup trucks and SUVs in the face of  surging gas prices and tighter credit.      Two plants in the United States and one in Mexico are also  slated to close.      The CAW says the closure of the Oshawa plant is a betrayal.  GM and the CAW signed a new three-year collective bargaining  agreement on May 15 that included a wage freeze and GM promises  to boost production in Canada rather than cut it.      Under that deal, GM said it would start producing hybrid  versions of two of its trucks at the Oshawa plant.      The plant currently produces the Chevrolet Silverado and  the GMC Sierra crew-cab and extended-cab pickup trucks, which  GM Canada spokesman Stew Low said are taking the biggest hit of  GM's products in the U.S.      He said the hybrid versions of the Silverado and Sierra  would still be built and rolled out at the end of the year, but  at other plants, either in the United States or in Mexico.      'Our main customer is the U.S. and there is a huge and very  drastic shift away from trucks and SUVs and we have to react to  that because we can't continue to buy vehicles that people  aren't buying,' Low said.      U.S. auto sales figures released on Tuesday showed that GM  truck sales were down 39 percent in May from May last year.  Sales of the Silverado down 44 percent and those of the GMC  Sierra down 33.9 percent.

And it's costing them millions each year.\n\n\u2022 Click here to see photos of the UAW's $33 million retreat.\n\nThe UAW, known more for its strikes than its slices, hosts seminars and junkets at the Walter and May Reuther Family Education Center in Onaway, Mich., which is nestled on \"1,000 heavily forested acres\" on Michigan's Black Lake, according to its Web site.\n\nBut the Black Lake club and retreat, which are among the union's biggest fixed assets, have lost $23 million in the past five years alone, a heavy albatross around the union's neck as it tries to manage a multibillion-dollar pension plan crisis.\n\nCritics call it a resort for union leaders that wastes money from union dues.\n\n\"It's their members' money that they're spending on this thing,\" said Justin Wilson, managing director of the Center for Union Facts, a union watchdog group. \"The union has bigger issues at hand than managing a golf course.\"\n\nManaging the course may become a burden for the union. The UAW covers costs for the Reuther Center from the interest it earns on its strike fund, according to tax documents, but massive losses in the past five years have forced the union to make heavy loans to keep the center afloat. Critics call it a poor investment for a group with over $1.25 billion in assets.\n\n\"Unions certainly have had real estate investments in the past, but investments are supposed to make money, not bleed money,\" said Wilson.\n\nThe UAW did not return calls from FOXNews.com, and a spokesman could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe Reuther Center is open 11 months of the year to offer courses on leadership, political action, civil rights and other topics; it hosts nearly 10,000 visitors annually. The UAW says it sends workers there to \"learn, experience unionism (and) commit to labor's cause,\" according to their Web site.\n\nThe center was purchased in 1967 and underwent massive renovations in the '90s under the careful watch of former UAW president Steve Yokich. \"Today's Black Lake might not exist if not for Steve Yokich,\" said union member Bob Reidt, whom Yokich appointed as Black Lake's director. \"Yokich is responsible for rebuilding Black Lake.\"\n\nThe UAW erected a monument to its longtime president Walter Reuther \u2014 the center's namesake \u2014 which bears an inscription of his words: \"There is no greater calling than to serve your brother. There is no greater satisfaction than to have done it well.\"\n\nBut Reuther, who died in a plane crash en route to the center in 1970, never knew the satisfaction of Black Lake's \"well-groomed fairways,\" a course that Michigan Golf Magazine called a \"stunning visual marvel.\"\n\nUnion members can play golf at discounted rates on one of the country's top 100 courses, designed in 2000 by famed course architect Rees Jones at a cost of $6 million.\n\nThe center has a storied history. Reuther had his ashes scattered at the site, and Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz honeymooned there in 1940, well before it was bought by the UAW.\n\n\"It's funny that they call it an education center \u2014 it's a resort,\" said Wilson. \"If I was a union member, I would prefer that they rented out a room at the Ramada Inn.\"",

        "Text": "  (Adds South Korean prime minister, paragraph 16-17)      By Doug Palmer      WASHINGTON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - U.S. autoworkers and  troubled automaker Chrysler urged Congress on Wednesday not to  approve a free trade pact with South Korea until it has been  renegotiated to address their concerns.      The deal struck in April 2007 by the Bush administration  'would threaten the jobs of tens of thousands of American  workers, exacerbating the already serious difficulties facing  the U.S. auto industry and its workers and retirees,' said Ron  Gettelfinger, president of the United Auto Workers union.      Gettelfinger told the Senate Commerce Committee the  agreement fails to tear down South Korean regulatory barriers  that have long thwarted sales of U.S. and other foreign cars,  even though South Korea would be required to immediately  eliminate its tariffs on U.S. cars and trucks.      John Bozzella, Chrysler's vice president for external  affairs and public policy, said the agreement 'narrows, but  does not eliminate discrimination against U.S. auto importers'  in South Korea and rewards that country for failing to live up  to previous auto trade deals.      The warnings came on the same day the U.S. House of  Representatives approved $25 billion in loans to help Chrysler,  Ford and General Motors through current hard times. That  legislation now goes to the Senate for a vote.      Last year, South Korea exported 668,000 autos to the United  States, but imported only 6,500 U.S. vehicles      Presidential Democratic candidate Barack Obama has promised  to negotiate the trade deal if elected. His Republican rival  John McCain has urged approval of the pact.           SUPPORT FROM FARM, BUSINESS GROUPS      The agreement enjoys broad support outside the auto sector  from many farm and business groups eager to increase sales in  South Korea's $1 trillion economy.      Myron Brilliant, president of the U.S.-Korea Business  Council, said the pact does tackle many 'non-tariff barriers'  the U.S. auto sector has long complained about.      South Korea also pledged not to 'discourage the purchase or  use of U.S. goods or services -- an important commitment in  light of the past anti-import campaigns in Korea,' he said.      The U.S. International Trade Commission has estimated the  agreement would likely have a 'negligible' effect on overall  U.S. auto trade, Brilliant said.      The independent trade panel forecast auto imports from  South Korea would increase under the pact, but said most gains  would come at the expense of other foreign suppliers.      The Bush administration still hopes lawmakers will approve  the agreement this year in a possible lame duck session of  Congress after the Nov. 4 elections.      Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Bryon Dorgan, a North  Dakota Democrat and foe of Bush administration trade deals,  said lawmakers would not approve the pact in 2008.      'I believe unless it's modified in a very substantial way  it's not going to be approved by any Congress,' Dorgan said.      Speaking to the Asia Society think tank in New York, South  Korean Prime Minister Han Seung-soo said his country still  hoped for the bill's passage -- if necessary in a lame duck  session of Congress after the Nov. 4 election.      'It will be beneficial not only to Korea, but also to the  United States and to the world,' Han said.

        "Text": "    TORONTO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The Canadian Auto Workers union  said on Tuesday it would find cost cutting measures to remain  competitive with the U.S. arms of General Motors Corp <GM.N> and  Chrysler [CBS.UL] after the companies reached agreements in  principal with the United Autoworkers union.      'We are going to measure what the UAW just recently concluded  in bargaining and then we're going to measure it to what the  Canadian operations are, then we're going to maintain our  competitive advantage,' CAW President Ken Lewenza told reporters.      Lewenza said he did not want to speculate on what the union  might do to save the automakers money. He added that the CAW had  yet to see the terms and conditions the companies need to meet to  qualify for loans from the governments of Canada and the province  of Ontario.      GM and Chrysler are due to present their viability plans to  Ottawa on Friday.      The Detroit-based automakers presented their restructuring  plans to U.S. officials earlier on Tuesday and both asked for more  government funding to stay afloat than originally planned.      For its part, GM said it was looking for up to $30 billion  more in U.S. government aid, while Chrysler was looking for  another $5 billion.      GM said it was working to reach agreements with the UAW and  bondholders to reduce around $47 billion in debt.      GM also said it would cut its U.S. workforce by another 20,000  jobs by 2012, with most of those reductions coming earlier.      Chrysler said it plans to cut its total manpower by 3,000  people in 2009.      Lewenza called for the Canadian government to make sure that  the companies maintain a healthy job count in Canada as a  condition of giving them any loans.      'The only way that you can repay the loans, which we are  committed to do, not just as a company, but as CAW members, is to  have a manufacturing footprint in Canada that is profitable,' he  said.      Chrysler said on Tuesday it planned to start talks with the  CAW next week and GM said it planned to reach a deal on a new  contract with the union by the end of March.

        "Text": "    By John McCrank      TORONTO, June 26 (Reuters) - Canadian autoworkers  acknowledged that General Motors Corp's <GM.N> decision to  close a Oshawa, Ontario, truck plant next year was irrevocable,  a union leader said on Thursday after a meeting with company  officials.      'Are we accepting it? Eventually, if someone keeps hitting  you over the head with a sledgehammer, you're going to wake  up,' said Buzz Hargrove, president of the Canadian Auto  Workers, said at the union's headquarters.      Hargrove said GM told the union it may decide to build a  new model in its Oshawa car plant, where the new Chevrolet  Camaro muscle car is set to begin production, but he added the  situation looked bleak.      'We talked about putting together an incentive program that  will help with the downsizing of the Oshawa operation over the  next four or five years,' said Hargrove.      The CAW said it would take a couple of weeks to look at the  GM proposal on incentives before responding.      About 2,600 unionized workers will lose their jobs when the  truck plant is closed.      GM's announcement of the closure ignited a firestorm of  protest that included a 12-day blockade of GM Canada's  headquarters. It came just two-weeks after the company signed a  new three-year labor agreement with the union in which it said  it would keep the plant open until at least 2011.      An Ontario judge ordered an end to the blockade, but added  that GM acted with 'almost deceitful behavior' in the contract  negotiations, which could make future bargaining difficult.      The union has not totally given up hope on the fate of the  plant, hoping the cyclical nature of the auto industry will  allow GM to reopen it in the future, said Chris Buckley,  president of CAW Local 222, in Oshawa.      'Their business is changing every month ... so we're hoping  that over the next year or two... things will turn around  somewhat,' he said, saying the union hoped GM could eventually  find a vehicle that could fit into the Oshawa truck plant  without a huge capital expenditure.      'The key is for them not to demolish that facility,' he  said.      GM shares dropped to their lowest in 53 years on Thursday  after Goldman Sachs cut the struggling U.S. auto industry's  largest manufacturer to a 'sell rating' and warned it would  have to raise capital. See [ID:nN26451117]      The housing and credit crises in the United States, along  with the high price of gasoline, has put a big dent in U.S.  auto sales, especially trucks and SUV's.      GM makes the Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra at the  Oshawa truck plant. It is one of four truck plants in North  America the company said it would shutter to scale back  production.      GM officials left the meeting without speaking to  reporters.

        "Text": "    CINCINNATI, June 3 (Reuters) - The union representing  autoworkers at the General Motors Corp <GM.N> truck plant in  Moraine, Ohio, said on Tuesday it will fight plans to close the  assembly plant, one of four on the chopping block.      Gaylen Turner, president of IUE-CWA Local 798 representing  some 2,300 current workers at the Moraine plant, said GM's  decision to shutter the plant, announced earlier on Tuesday,  was not a surprise but would be opposed by the union.      'We anticipate having additional meetings, sitting down and  talking about contractual issues, meeting with the  international union to see where we go from here and what can  be done,' Turner said.      'Never never means never. Until they tell me there is no  other chance, I'm going to continue to fight to do what we can  do to keep the place open. I'm going to fight as long as I  can,' he added.      He said the Detroit automaker's decision to close the  Moraine plant is sad but not unanticipated, since it was  already being downsized and lacked product plans after 2010.      'I don't know if you're ever ready for it. People  understood that it was something that could happen. But you  always hold out hope,' Turner said.      GM said on Tuesday it was closing four truck plants and  could sell its Hummer brand to cut its output of slow-selling  trucks and SUVs in response to higher gasoline prices that the  automaker now sees as a permanent threat to its business.      The Moraine plant makes GM's Envoy, Trailblazer and Saab  models. As of Monday, more than 300 workers had accepted  'special attrition packages,' Turner said.      Tony Curington, a union representative for displaced  workers in the area, said the plant closing would only add to  an already stressed economy.      'Some people were hoping they'd keep that facility open.  But now this has sealed their fate,' Curington said. 'You are  going to have a lot of dislocated workers who will be depending  on a lot of social services. There is nowhere for them to turn.  The manufacturing industry has dried up around here. It is  really going to devastate the area.'      GM said the latest steps would cut $1 billion from its  structural costs by 2010, but analysts questioned whether the  steps would improve the automaker's turnaround prospects in the  face of a U.S. market now seen slumping well into 2009.      GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said higher gasoline prices  have caused consumers to swap out of higher-margin trucks and  SUVs faster than GM had expected.      'U.S. economic and market conditions have become  significantly more difficult,' he said.      GM shares, which have lost almost 60 percent since peaking  in October last year, were up 29 cents or 1.7 percent at $17.73  in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

        "Text": " (Adds details, comments, background)      OSHAWA, Ontario, June 4 (Reuters) - Hundreds of angry  autoworkers blockaded the entrance to General Motors of  Canada's <GM.N> headquarters in Oshawa, Ontario, on Wednesday,  demanding the company reverse its decision to close the local  truck plant and crying foul over the timing of the closure.      'We're not allowing any GM of Canada employees to enter the  headquarters building,' said Chris Buckley, of the Canadian  Auto Workers union, which says 2,600 jobs will go if the truck  plant closes.      'We are going to stay here until General Motors reverses  the decision they made yesterday, or at the very least commits  to a product for the Oshawa truck plant, or sits down  face-to-face with this union to try to explain why they have  broken our brand new agreement.'      GM said it would meet with the union in Detroit on Friday.      The company announced on Tuesday it would closed the Oshawa  plant, and three others in North America, as it tries to shore  up a restructuring plan that has been overtaken by a steep  decline in U.S. sales of pickup trucks and SUVs in the face of  surging gas prices and tight credit.      Two truck plants in the United States and one in Mexico are  also slated to close.      Up to 750 people, many clad in red T-shirts emblazoned with  a white maple leaf and the words 'Made in Canada matters',  peacefully blocked the road leading to GM's Canadian  headquarters.      'I feel sick about this situation and all I can do is  visualize GM workers on the welfare line,' said Jim Bedford, a  retired GM employee from nearby Bowmanville, Ontario.           BARGAINING FAITH QUESTIONED      The CAW, which has around 13,000 members at GM, says the  closure of the Oshawa plant is a betrayal. GM and the CAW  signed a new three-year labor agreement on May 15 that included  a wage freeze and a promise by GM to boost production in Canada  rather than cut it.      Under that deal, GM said it would start producing hybrid  versions of two of its trucks at the Oshawa plant.      The plant currently produces the Chevrolet Silverado and  the GMC Sierra crew-cab and extended-cab pickup trucks, which  GM Canada spokesman Stew Low said are taking the biggest hit of  GM's products in the U.S.      He said the hybrid versions of the Silverado and Sierra  would still be built and rolled out at the end of the year, but  at other plants, either in the United States or in Mexico.      Auto analyst Dennis DesRosiers said in a note that the  final decision to close the Oshawa plant probably had not yet  been made during the bargaining, but the company most likely  had an idea of what it wanted to do.      'The real reason is that they didn't have to and it would  weaken their position in the labor talks ... And why would GM  provide him (CAW President Buzz Hargrove) this information  which would only have strengthened the CAW position and  hardened the resolve of the CAW.'           U.S. CONSUMERS WANT FUEL ECONOMY      GM's Low said the closure boils down to a rapid shift in  customer demand away from larger gas-guzzlers as pump prices  surged to record levels.      'Our main customer is the U.S. and there is a huge and very  drastic shift away from trucks and SUVs and we have to react to  that because we can't continue to buy vehicles that people  aren't buying,' Low said.      U.S. auto sales figures released on Tuesday showed GM truck  sales were down 39 percent in May from a year earlier. Sa",

        "Text": " (Adds finance minister's comments in final three paragraphs)      OSHAWA, Ontario, June 4 (Reuters) - Hundreds of angry  autoworkers blockaded the entrance to General Motors of  Canada's <GM.N> headquarters in Oshawa, Ontario, on Wednesday,  demanding the company reverse its decision to close the local  truck plant and crying foul over the timing of the closure.      'We're not allowing any GM of Canada employees to enter the  headquarters building,' said Chris Buckley, of the Canadian  Auto Workers union, which says 2,600 jobs will go if the truck  plant closes.      'We are going to stay here until General Motors reverses  the decision they made yesterday, or at the very least commits  to a product for the Oshawa truck plant, or sits down  face-to-face with this union to try to explain why they have  broken our brand new agreement.'      GM said it would meet with the union in Detroit on Friday.      The company announced on Tuesday it would closed the Oshawa  plant, and three others in North America, as it tries to shore  up a restructuring plan that has been overtaken by a steep  decline in U.S. sales of pickup trucks and SUVs in the face of  surging gas prices and tight credit.      Two truck plants in the United States and one in Mexico are  also slated to close.      Up to 750 people, many clad in red T-shirts emblazoned with  a white maple leaf and the words 'Made in Canada matters',  peacefully blocked the road leading to GM's Canadian  headquarters.      'I feel sick about this situation and all I can do is  visualize GM workers on the welfare line,' said Jim Bedford, a  retired GM employee from nearby Bowmanville, Ontario.           BARGAINING FAITH QUESTIONED      The CAW, which has around 13,000 members at GM, says the  closure of the Oshawa plant is a betrayal. GM and the CAW  signed a new three-year labor agreement on May 15 that included  a wage freeze and a promise by GM to boost production in Canada  rather than cut it.      Under that deal, GM said it would start producing hybrid  versions of two of its trucks at the Oshawa plant.      The plant currently produces the Chevrolet Silverado and  the GMC Sierra crew-cab and extended-cab pickup trucks, which  GM Canada spokesman Stew Low said are taking the biggest hit of  GM's products in the United States.

        "Text": "    NEW YORK, Dec 21 (Reuters) - A forced restructuring at  General Motors Corp <GM.N> could make the U.S. automaker's debt  appealing, according to weekly business newspaper Barron's in  its Dec. 22 edition.      The report said that under a U.S. government bailout, which  requires the automaker take steps to ensure its viability, GM  may renegotiate some debt and trim pay and benefits for its  union-member autoworkers. The report cited employee costs as  hurting bondholders and shareholders in the past.      'There could be value in GM bonds if the company  restructures,' the report said. Still, there are risks,  especially if there was a future bankruptcy, which could  drastically lower any recovery value.      GM unsecured debt rallied on Friday after GM and Chrysler  LLC [CBS.UL] were extended a $17.4 billion lifeline by the  United States. Rival Ford Motor Co <F.N> said it did not at  this time need federal funds.

        "Text": "    NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The union representing  striking machinists at Boeing <BA.N> on Monday said the two  sides have reached a tentative deal and the union will hold a  vote this week.      The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace  Workers (IAM) said it reached a tentative agreement with Boeing  Co <BA.N>, which could mean the end of the strike that began on  Sept. 6.      The specific Boeing representative, who would be  knowledgeable about the deal, could not be reached immediately  for comment.      The tentative four-year contract would provide job security  and limit the amount of work outside vendors can perform in the  workplace, the union said.      The agreement was hammered out over a five-day period with  assistance from federal mediators.      Among the other issues resolved in the latest round of  bargaining were wage rates, health care benefits for current  and future employees, pension improvements and work rule  changes designed to improve productivity, the union said in a  statement.      The union said that details of the accord would be withheld  until they can be compiled and distributed to IAM members in  all Boeing locations.      The tentative agreement has the unanimous endorsement of  the IAM negotiating committee and will be presented to members  for a ratification vote, which will take place in three to five  days. A simple majority is required to ratify the tentative  agreement, the union said.      The IAM represents nearly 27,000 employees at Boeing  facilities in Kansas, Oregon and Washington and California.

        "Text": "    WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Aug 7 (Reuters) - A mediator brought  together officials from Potash Corp of Saskatchewan <POT.TO>  and the United Steelworkers union on Thursday for what a union  spokesman said were pivotal talks on a contract dispute at  three mines.      'This meeting is really crucial,' said Roger Falconer of  the United Steelworkers ahead of the face-to-face talks, adding  he was hopeful mediator Vic Pathe would help broker a deal.      About 500 workers at the Saskatchewan mines have rejected a  contract offer from Potash Corp, the world's largest fertilizer  maker. They are refusing to work overtime, but the only strike  to date has been a one-day stoppage at a single mine.      Potash Corp is reaping record profits from the world's  insatiable demand for fertilizer to boost yields of pricey  crops, leaving the company and its competitors essentially sold  out of potash at a time of sky-high prices.      Potash stock was down 31 Canadian cents at C$188.99 on the  Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday.      The stock plunged earlier this week to four-month lows  following a broad sell-off in commodity markets. But it is  still more than double what it was last year.      Union members have said they want a bigger share of the  profits, and the market conditions give them a strong  bargaining position, Falconer said.      'The company has to realize it's not dealing with the same  set of circumstances they have in the last four or five sets of  bargaining' talks, he said.      A spokesman for the company declined comment on Thursday's  meeting. 'I would simply say that the mediation process is  ongoing,' Bill Johnson said.      If there is not significant movement toward a deal at the  meeting, union members were prepared to begin strikes that  could affect the company's production, Falconer said.      'I can tell you categorically that our members are ready to  hit the picket lines immediately,' he said.      The union staged a one-day strike last week at one of the  mines, but have since worked all but overtime hours after their  union and the company resumed talks. Mediator Pathe has met  with both sides separately since Monday.      The company has said the offer rejected by workers would be  the richest in the potash industry. Neither side has commented  on specifics in the offer, but media reports have said it would  boost pay by 27 to 35.6 percent over three years at one mine.

'The union is meeting the company later this evening,' the  source said.       'The plant is in the process of beginning to shut down. They  are reducing crude throughput.'

One of the two smaller units is being shut, while the other  two remain in operation, the source said.

        "Text": "    WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Canadian grain  handler Viterra Inc <VT.TO> was slated to hold mediated  contract talks with grain and office workers beginning on  Thursday, the company and the Grain Services Union said.      Unionized workers at the company's head office in Regina,  Saskatchewan have been on strike over wages and benefits since  early July.      Grain handlers warned the company they would begin  escalating action during harvest, and now have picket lines at  four country locations, the union said in an update to its  members on its web site.      The affected sites include Balgonie, the Moose Jaw seed  plant, Shaunavon and Swift Current. A company spokesman was not  immediately able to confirm the affected sites.      Viterra was slated to meet with a federal mediator and the  bargaining committee for operations and maintenance workers  later in the day, with talks expanding on Friday to include  representatives of the office workers, the union said.      A union spokesman was not immediately available for  comment.      Viterra, which reported stronger-than-expected quarterly  profits on Wednesday, has said the strike has had little impact  on its operations to date and said it expected to keep  elevators running during harvest.      More than 600 of its elevator workers are in a legal strike  position along with about 200 office workers. Viterra has a  total work force of about 4,000.

        "Text": " (The following statement was released by the ratings agency)      June 9 - Moody's Investors Service has today upgraded to A3  from Baa1 the senior unsecured issuer and debt ratings of Union  Fenosa SA <UNF.MC> and its guaranteed subsidiary Union Fenosa  Finance BV. The outlook is stable. The Prime-2 short-term rating  is affirmed.      The rating upgrade recognises the company's steady progress  in improving and stabilising its business and financial risk  profile and Moody's view that the company will continue to  maintain a credit profile commensurate with an A3 rating over the  medium term.      According to Moody's, Union Fenosa has demonstrated a strong  track record on delivering against its strategic plan and its  improvement in business risk has been achieved through timely  execution of its capex plans and the strategic alliances it has  formed, whilst its financial profile has improved and stabilised  via asset divestments and cash flow growth. The company today  maintains a sound position within the Spanish electricity sector  with a market share of around 13%, benefiting from its vertically  integrated position and a well-hedged thermal generation  portfolio with favourable gas contracts. Moody's also believes  that the recent acquisition of a stake in the Kangra mine in  South Africa should help Union Fenosa in hedging its coal-fired  assets.      The company has an efficient generation portfolio, but is  nonetheless exposed to greater commodity price risk than its  larger Iberian peers given its greater thermal generation bias  and mid-market gas position. Moody's cautions that a degree of  overcapacity in the Spanish electricity sector  -  particularly  if some competitors make further large investments in generation   -  could lead to greater pricing volatility, which might have an  adverse impact on the company's margins. Around 25-30% of Union  Fenosa's EBITDA comes from higher-risk international business,  although Moody's does not expect this to substantially increase  in the intermediate term.      Union Fenosa's financial profile is expected to gradually  improve over the life of the strategic plan to 2011 based on its  current EUR6.1 billion investment programme. Moody's would expect  Union Fenosa to continue to demonstrate financial discipline with  regard to further investments or acquisitions outside of the  plan. As a result, the company should be able to maintain the  following credit metrics: RCF/adjusted debt in the mid-teens,  FFO/debt in the high teens/low twenties and FFO/interest of 4x,  assuming a similar business risk profile, for the current A3  category. These guidelines could shift higher or lower in the  event that the company makes riskier or less risky investments,  respectively, outside its current strategic plan.      Moody's notes that Union Fenosa's controlling shareholder  ACS, with 45%, also owns a direct 7.8% stake in Iberdrola (and an  additional 5.2% via equity swaps) and has commented that it would  envisage Union Fenosa playing a role in any further consolidation  of the Spanish utility sector. Should such a development occur  involving further asset acquisition, Moody's would expect that a  larger market share and a more diversified generation portfolio  could benefit Union Fenosa's business risk profile. Moody's  further expects that in such circumstances the company would  ensure that an appropriate financial profile is achieved  commensurate with the current rating.      The rat",
