        "Text": "    MONTEVIDEO, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Uruguayan President Tabare  Vazquez vetoed a law decriminalizing abortions in the first 12  weeks of pregnancy, arguing it violated the right to life, the  office of the presidency said on Friday.      A doctor and center-left leader, Vazquez had repeatedly  vowed to veto the easing of abortion restrictions. Congress  passed the measure earlier this week, in a rare move in  predominantly Roman Catholic Latin America.      In a statement explaining the veto, Vazquez said it was  more important to help women with unwanted pregnancies than to  facilitate abortions for them.      'Our laws cannot ignore the reality of the existence of  human life in the gestation period, as scientific evidence  clearly shows,' the president said.      'It's more appropriate to look for a solution based on  solidarity, giving a woman the freedom to make other choices  and thereby save both her and her baby,' Vazquez said.      Support for the law allowing early abortions was not seen  as strong enough to override the presidential veto.      Abortion is largely banned in Latin America, home to about  half the world's Roman Catholics. In the region, Cuba has the  most permissive laws, and Mexico City allows abortions on  demand in the first trimester of pregnancy.      A congressional committee in Brazil defeated a measure to  legalize the procedure earlier this year.

The protesters, who said they were Protestant and Catholic,  shouted against Chinese policies restricting family sizes and  sometimes imposing forced abortions on women who violate the  rule.      'End the brutality,' one yelled on the Square, which is the  city's symbolic heart. 'To those who are forced to go through  forced abortions and have no voice, we are your voice.'      Police took the protesters away and questioned them on a  nearby bench. Then, unusually for this security-wary country, the  three were allowed to leave, at least for now.      Earlier in the day, two American and two British protesters  were detained after they unfurled banners calling for Tibetan  independence near the main Games stadium, where the Games open on  Friday.      The Games torch also began its relay through the city on  Wednesday.

The Senate voted 17 to 13 in favor of the bill after the  lower house of Congress approved it last week in a session that  was interrupted by a bomb threat.      Abortion is largely banned in Latin America, home to about  half the world's Roman Catholics. Uruguay's center-left  president, Tabare Vazquez, has vowed to veto any law easing  restrictions on the procedure.      Congress could override the veto in theory, but support for  the bill is not seen as strong enough for that.      'Whether the president vetoes it or not, it's important  that Congress has established this right,' said ruling party  senator Margarita Percovich, who told Reuters she hopes Vazquez  will change his position.      Under the current law, which dates from 1938, women who  abort and the people who assist them face jail terms. Abortion  is only permitted in cases of rape or when the life of the  woman or the fetus is endangered.      A recent survey by private pollster Interconsult showed 57  percent of Uruguayans supported fewer restrictions on abortion,  and 63 percent were against a presidential veto on the bill.      Church leaders in Uruguay warned that Catholic lawmakers  voting for the bill could face excommunication, a statement  that sparked criticism from across the political spectrum.

        "Text": "    By Will Dunham      WASHINGTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Babies born four to six  weeks prematurely have more than triple the risk of developing  cerebral palsy than full-term babies, U.S. researchers said on  Thursday.      The study focused on the specific serious neurological  problems associated with late pre-term births -- babies born  between 34 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Increasing numbers of  these babies are being born in the United States.      Researchers led by Joann Petrini, an epidemiologist with  the March of Dimes advocacy group, tracked 141,321 babies born  between 2000 and 2004 in the United States.      The late pre-term babies were about 3.4 times as likely to  develop cerebral palsy as full-term babies. They also were  about 25 percent more likely to develop learning, speech and  other developmental delays and mental retardation as full-term  babies, according to the study.      Cerebral palsy refers to a group of disorders that affect a  child's ability to coordinate body movements. Symptoms range  from mild to severe and may include lack of muscle  coordination, stiff muscles and exaggerated reflexes, walking  problems, drooling and tremors.      It is incurable and frequently requires long-term care.  Other neurological problems including mental retardation or  seizures may appear in children who have cerebral palsy.      About 800,000 children and adults in the United States have  cerebral palsy, according to the March of Dimes.      'We know that very pre-term babies have higher rates of  cerebral palsy from existing research, but this paper shows  that even the late pre-term babies are three times as likely to  be diagnosed with cerebral palsy as full-term babies,' Petrini  said in a telephone interview.      In this study, very pre-term babies -- those born after 30  to 33 weeks of pregnancy -- were eight times as likely to  develop cerebral palsy as full-term babies.      The researchers said previous studies showed that late  pre-term babies also had higher rates of respiratory distress,  jaundice, seizures, feeding problems and other problems.      In the United States, growing numbers of babies are being  born prematurely. About 70 percent of all pre-term births fall  into this late pre-term birth category.      Petrini cited several factors behind the rise in late  pre-term births. These include more older women and women with  obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure having babies, more  babies being delivered by Caesarean section, and more being  conceived after fertility treatments.

        "Text": "     WASHINGTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - No high-quality study done  to date can document that having an abortion causes  psychological distress, or a 'post-abortion syndrome,' and  efforts to show it does occur appear to be politically  motivated, U.S. researchers said on Thursday.      A team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore reviewed 21  studies involving more than 150,000 women and found the  high-quality studies showed no significant differences in  long-term mental health between women who choose to abort a  pregnancy and others.      'The best research does not support the existence of a  'post-abortion syndrome' similar to post-traumatic stress  disorder,' Dr. Robert Blum, who led the study published in the  journal Contraception, said in a statement.      'Based on the best available evidence, emotional harm  should not be a factor in abortion policy. If the goal is to  help women, program and policy decisions should not distort  science to advance political agendas,' added Vignetta Charles,  a researcher and doctoral student at Johns Hopkins who worked  on the study.       An estimated 1.29 million American women get elective  abortions each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention. An estimated 25 million women globally  have legal abortions every year.      Abortion is a hot-button political issue, with many voters  and members of the U.S. Congress as well as state lawmakers  seeking to ban it.      'The U.S. Supreme Court, while noting that 'we find no  reliable data to measure the phenomenon,' cited adverse mental  health outcomes for women as part of the rationale for limiting  late term abortions,' Blum's team wrote.      The researchers reviewed all English-language,  peer-reviewed publications between 1989 and 2008 that studied  relationships between abortion and long-term mental health.      They analyzed those that included valid mental health  measures and factored in pre-existing mental health status and   potentially confusing factors.      'The best quality studies indicate no significant         differences in long-term mental health between women in the  United States who choose to terminate a pregnancy and those who  do not,' they wrote.      '...studies with the most flawed methodology consistently  found negative mental health consequences of abortion,' they  added. 'Scientists are still conducting research to answer  politically motivated questions.'

        "Text": "    By Ben Harding      MADRID, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Spanish abortion clinics began a  week-long strike on Tuesday, criticising the government for what  they said was harassment since a series of police raids on  Barcelona centres accused of illegal abortions.      More than 1,000 women will be unable to have an abortion  this week after 31 private clinics shut their doors to all cases  except for those when the mother's health was at risk, said a  spokeswoman for abortion clinic association ACAI. The 31 clinics  performed most of Spain's 101,592 abortions in 2006, ACAI said.      Late last year Barcelona police arrested 13 people, many of  them gynaecologists and anaesthetists, in raids against clinics  accused of performing illegal, late-term abortions.      ACAI spokeswoman Francisca Garcia said the government had  increased intrusive inspections against its members even though  none of its members were involved in the raids. Spain's health  minister had ignored requests for talks, she said.      Spain's health ministry was not immediately available to  comment on the accusation.      'We think the number and manner of inspections is abusive,'  Garcia said, adding that so many inspections, three times the  norm in some clinics, violated the privacy of patients and was a  slur on the professionalism of staff.      Spain decriminalised abortion in 1985, 10 years after the  death of conservative dictator Francisco Franco, but while the  number of abortions has doubled in the last decade, the practice  is controversial in the traditionally Catholic country.      Abortion is only permitted in certain cases, for example up  to 12 weeks for women who have been raped or up to 22 weeks if a  foetus is malformed. It is also available if a birth poses a  psychological risk to the mother.      One of those detained in the raids was Peruvian doctor  Carlos Morin, who was shown in a television programme appearing  to offer an abortion to an undercover Danish journalist who was  eight months pregnant in return for 4,000 euros.      The police findings triggered indignation in conservative  media.      But some members of the governing Socialist Party said  abortion laws should be further liberalised. Prime Minister Jose  Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, facing a tight contest in March general  elections, rejected this.      Last month the windows of a clinic in Madrid were smashed by  masked attackers and staff across Spain have reported a rise in  threats against them, Garcia said.      'After 22 years of exercising this right a shadow of doubt  has started to appear over our professionalism,' she said.

        "Text": "No matter what you think about the abortion issue, you should be very disturbed by what continues to happen in Kansas.\n\nThis man, Dr. George Tiller, known as \u201cTiller the baby killer,\u201d is performing late term abortions without defining the specific medical reasons why.\n\nLet's be more blunt. Tiller is executing fetuses in his Wichita clinic for $5,000. And records show he'll do it for vague medical reasons. That is, he'll kill the fetus, viable outside the womb, if the mother wants it dead. No danger to the mother's life, no catastrophic damage if the woman delivers.\n\nNow, some Kansas politicians want to stop the madness. But incredibly, Governor Kathleen Sebelius is protecting Tiller, citing privacy. The governor vetoed a bill a few weeks ago that would have forced Tiller to provide a specific medical reason for destroying a viable fetus.\n\nNow America is a great country, but this kind of barbaric display in Kansas diminishes our entire nation. Tiller has killed thousands, thousands of late-term fetuses without explanation. And Governor Sebelius is allowing him to continue the slaughter. How the governor sleeps at night is beyond me.\n\nThere are Americans who believe that babies that are about to be born are not human beings. How they form that conclusion is interesting. And only a handful of doctors in the USA will perform late-term abortions for any reason, because doctors know viable life when they see it. Now a few months ago, we talked with a young woman who allowed Tiller to kill her fetus. Here's part of what she had to say.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKELLY: And about the third or fourth day, Dr. Tiller came in and injected into the amniotic sack saline solution, which suffocated and burned my baby to death. They decide that you are dilated enough and they put you in a wheelchair and wheel you out to another room.\n\nAnd in this other room, there is basically a toilet. And they told me to sit on the toilet, lean on the nurse, and push. Push my baby into a toilet. And after that, they wheel you into another room to remove all the, you know, after birth. And really that's the only two times I ever saw the doctor was when he injected the saline solution and when he finished the process by removing the after birth.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAnd the woman was just 14-years old when Tiller operated on her. She is haunted by her decision to this day.\n\nIt's ironic that organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International say nothing about the work of Dr. Tiller. Apparently executing viable fetuses in the womb is OK with the human rights people.\n\nOnce again, this isn't about a woman's right to choose or The New York Times\u2019 plea for reproductive rights. This is about late term abortions for just about any reason. No question Dr. Tiller has blood on his hands, but now so does Governor Sebelius. She is not fit to serve. Nor is any Kansas politician who supports Tiller's business of destruction. I wouldn't want to be these people if there is a judgment day.\n\nAnd that's the \"Memo.\"\n\nMost Ridiculous Item\n\nTime now for \"The Most Ridiculous Item of the Day.\" Our good friend, Howard Dean, was in New York City recently. But he didn't drop in here. Instead, he went to see that Colbert guy.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, COMEDY CENTRAL'S \"THE COLBERT REPORT\": If you had to vote for one of the Republican candidates, who would you vote for? You can talk about them, right? You can talk about them.\n\nHOWARD DEAN, DNC CHAIRMAN: I thought about this ahead of time.\n\nCOLBERT: Who would it be?\n\nDEAN: If you were to pick Bill O'Reilly to be a running mate, I'd vote for Steve Colbert and Bill O'Reilly.\n\nCOLBERT: Really? That's great. I know Papa Bear watches, but I'm not sure whether he would take the vice presidential position. It's not his M.O.\n\nDEAN: And then you can do all the torturing you want. What does Bill O'Reilly do every night?\n\nCOLBERT: He might start with you.\n\nDEAN: He would start with me if I'd go on his show, but I come on this show instead, because it's much classier.\n\nCOLBERT: How come \u2014 thank you very much, sir. His words \u2014 his words, not mine, Bill.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHe's a fun guy. And Governor Dean is welcome to come on here any time. We won't torture him; we will just ask him questions.\n\nWe'll continue 24/7 on BillOReilly.com where you can get Dad this pen, \"Keep it Pithy.\" It's beautiful. You'll like it. \"No Bloviating\" T's, golf balls, signed \"Culture Warriors.\" Get Dad the best gifts for Father's Day on BillOReilly.com.\n\n\u2014You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Most Ridiculous Item\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

        "Text": "    CAPE TOWN, Feb 7 (Reuters) - South Africa's parliament on  Thursday approved legal changes to make abortions easier to  obtain, despite criticism from opponents who said the law was  already too lax.      The changes will provide for 24-hour abortion facilities, do  away with pre-approval procedures and permit all nurses --  instead of just midwives -- to terminate pregnancies.      'The amendment bill promotes quality health care,' Joyce  Masilo, a deputy from the ruling African National Congress, told  parliament's upper house, which unanimously passed the bill. It  will now be referred to President Thabo Mbeki to sign into law.      Critics said the law already made abortions too easy. Women  as young as 12 can get an abortion during the first 12 weeks of  pregnancy and in some cases up to 20 weeks.      Religious activists and several political parties opposed  the proposed changes, saying the bill should make counselling  mandatory given that women as young as 12 could have abortions  without their parents' knowledge.      But the ruling party's big parliamentary majority ensured  approval for the changes.

        "Text": "    FRANKFURT, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Short-term interbank borrowing  rates edged up on Wednesday after the European Central Bank  withdrew extra cash injected around the turn of the year  although two- to three-month Euribor interbank interest rates  continued to ease.      Banks received 151.5 billion euros ($222.7 billion) in  weekly funding from the ECB on Wednesday, less than half the  amount put into circulation to cover the New Year period,  tightening liquidity conditions.      The benchmark overnight EONIA rate <EONIA=> fixed at 4.119  percent on Tuesday, from 4.107 percent on Monday, the highest  since late November. The bid/ask spread on overnight cash  offered between banks was 4.12/4.20 percent at 1030 GMT,  according to Reuters data.      One-week Euribor <EURIBORSWD=>, an average of daily quotes  offered by banks to lend money to each other, rose to 4.186  percent from 4.146 percent on Tuesday and one-month Euribor  <EURIBOR1MD=> inched up to 4.210 percent versus 4.202 percent.      But at longer-term maturities, the absence of year-end  pressures kept rates on a downwards path.      Three-month Euribor <EURIBOR3MD=> was 4.597 percent from  4.598 percent, narrowing the spread over the ECB's 4 percent  benchmark, which was as high as 95 basis points on Dec. 12.

        "Text": "    BRASILIA, July 9 (Reuters) - A committee in Brazil's lower  house of Congress voted down a bill on Wednesday that would  have legalized abortion in the world's most populous Roman  Catholic nation.      The Justice and Constitution Committee in the Chamber of  Deputies voted 57-4 against a bill that had been stuck in  Congress for 17 years, steeped in controversy. It is now   likely to be shelved.      'This bill won't prosper in the Chamber,' said Deputy  Eduardo Cunha, committee leader.      Several ruling party legislators pushed the bill after  Health Minister Jose Temporao last year all but endorsed  legalizing abortion.      Church groups, which lobbied against the legislative  proposal and witnessed the hearing, cheered and prayed in  celebration after the vote.      Some deputies had placards hanging from their necks,  showing pictures of aborted fetuses.      A few legislators supported the bill.      'You can't treat this issue on the basis of religion or  belief. It's a public health issue,' said Deputy Jose Genoino,  who voted in favor of the proposal.           Temporao angered church groups by proposing a referendum on  the legalization of abortion and backing increased use of  contraceptives.      The government has begun distributing condoms in public  high schools and in April launched its own factory to produce  condoms made of rubber from Amazon trees.      Temporao has warned that the large number of women having  illegal abortions was a serious public health issue because of  often dangerous complications when they went awry.      Annually more than 200,000 women are hospitalized because  of botched abortions, government statistics show. Based on  those figures some experts estimate the number of abortions  could be as high as around 1 million per year.      Many Brazilians believe it is mostly poor teenagers who  abort. But a study co-sponsored by the University of Brasilia  showed that most abortions were practiced by Catholic mothers,  aged 20-29, with jobs, who used contraceptive devices and had  steady sexual partners.

        "Text": "    By Lee Jiyeon      SEOUL, April 4 (Reuters Life!) - At a clinic in a fashionable  area of Seoul, young women sit in plush leather couches waiting  for a doctor to give them an illegal abortion.      By the hundreds of thousands each year South Korean women  have gone to clinics like this, which operate in the open.      Abortions have been illegal for almost as long as South Korea  has existed but, in an uneasy compromise, law enforcement  officials have been willing to look the other way as long as  qualified doctors perform the operation.      Many public health experts in South Korea are pushing for  changes in the abortion law but face opposition from a strong  pro-life lobby in a country with one of Asia's largest  percentages of Christians and a government trying to boost the  lowest fertility rate in the developed world.      Some doctors are themselves reluctant to lose a lucrative  income in cash or credit and mostly away from the eyes of tax  officials.      'Abortions do bring in money,' said physician Park Sung-chul,  who was forced to shut down his private clinic because of a  substantial loss of income when he stopped doing the procedure.      The law allows for abortion only in cases where the mother's  health is at risk, the baby is to be born with severe birth  defects or the pregnancy was caused by a sexual crime.      'Most abortions are for pregnancies out of wedlock and not  for health reasons,' Park said.      According to the most recent figures, an estimated 350,000  abortions were performed in 2005. That is equivalent to about 80  percent of the total number of babies born that year.            CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT      Doctors can face up to two years in prison or lose their  licenses for illegal abortions, though only very few cases have  ever gone to court.      It is also illegal for doctors to tell expecting parents the  sex of their child because many families place a higher value on  having boys than girls.      South Korea criminalised abortion in 1953 when its  authoritarian leaders wanted to boost the population and build an  army powerful enough to fend off its rival North Korea.      But by the 1970s, population growth was getting out of  control, leading the country to draw up exceptions to the  abortion law.      Yonsei University medical law and ethics professor Kim  So-yoon, who headed a government-commissioned research team on  how to reform abortion laws feels a sweeping change is needed.      'We should not let these laws, which were set up under  different ideals, stay as they are,' said Kim.      Kim, with the backing of several women's rights groups, is  lobbying to widen the conditions under which abortion is  permitted, seen as more expedient than striking down the old law  and drawing up a new one.      Many South Korean Christians, who make up roughly a third of  the population, are fighting the change.      'The government, under its family planning policy, has  planted in people's minds for the past 35 years the idea that  there is nothing wrong with abortion,' Pastor Kim Hyeon-chul, one  of the leaders in the pro-life movement, said.      South Korean society does not generally look favourably on  young, single mothers, forcing many to seek abortions or give  birth in secret and put their child up for adoption.      In the meantime, a proliferation of postings seeking abortion  advice on the Internet suggests demand is as strong as ever.      'I'm a high-school student and would l",

        "Text": "    YAOUNDE, April 4 (Reuters) - Cameroon's government has  presented a constitutional reform to parliament to remove term  limits for President Paul Biya, who has ruled the central  African country for over 25 years, state radio said on Friday.      Popular discontent over the plans to extend Biya's rule when  his current seven-year term expires in 2011 was one of the  causes of rioting in Cameroon this year which left some 100  people dead, according to civil rights campaigners.      Biya had confirmed his intention to stand again in an  end-of-year speech, citing popular calls for him to stay in  power and saying the term limit was undemocratic.      He revised the constitution in 1996 -- after 14 years in  office -- to extend the presidential term from five to seven  years and make it renewable only once.       He won the first seven-year term in 1997 and was re-elected  in 2004, and is currently barred from running again in 2011.      Biya's rule has been marred by human rights abuses and  Cameroon's reputation as one of the most corrupt countries in  the world, particularly in the late 1990s. In recent years, some  ministers and senior officials have been jailed for graft.      Cameroon's parliament is overwhelmingly controlled by the  ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement.       Legislators in Nigeria, Zambia and Malawi have blocked  efforts to allow third terms for presidents in recent years.

        "Text": "    By Ed Stoddard      DALLAS, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Can Joe Biden bring his Catholic  brethren into Barack Obama's fold?      Biden, the Democratic vice presidential candidate and an  Irish Catholic from a Pennsylvania working-class background,  could also win over blue-collar workers who backed Obama's  party rival for the White House, Hillary Clinton.      'If we just focus on the religious element, adding Biden to  the Democratic ticket was an extremely smart move,' said  Michael Lindsay of Rice University in Houston. Obama made Biden  his running mate on Saturday.      'Biden has ties in a very important swing state,  Pennsylvania, where Catholics are the biggest constituency  whose votes are up for grabs,' Lindsay told Reuters.      U.S. presidential elections are often decided by swing  states that move from party to party. Catholics have been a  swing vote also for decades. Opinion polls show white Catholics  evenly split between Obama and Republican John McCain.      John Kennedy became America's only Catholic president in  1961. If elected, Biden would be the first Catholic vice  president. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is next in line to  the president after the vice president, is also a Catholic.      Faith features in U.S. elections despite a formal  separation of church and state in the workings of government.  Candidates are often asked about the role of faith in their  lives and how it might shape their presidencies.      Biden's broad support for abortion rights could help with  more liberal Catholics while his opposition to late-term  abortions could attract those who are uncomfortable with the  procedure but don't vote on it.           ABORTION ISSUE      Opinion polls show that abortion, a traditionally divisive  issue for Americans, is less of a factor for most people in  this election than the economy, the Iraq war and health care,  which top their priorities.      A Catholic candidate who speaks with passion about his  religion, such as Biden, might also attract blue collar  Hispanic voters, a majority of whom are Catholic.      Abortion may be more of a political minefield -- Catholic  doctrine is strongly opposed to it -- but Catholics who oppose  abortion rights and vote as such already are squarely in the  Republican camp.      'There is a broader group of Catholics who have pro-life  sympathies but who don't vote exclusively on that issue and in  that case Biden may be an appealing candidate,' said Allen  Hertzke, a professor of political science at the University of  Oklahoma in Norman.     'And the fact that he has opposed late-term abortions gives  him some talking points which Obama doesn't have,' he said.      Opinion polls have shown a close battle for the Catholic  vote at the national level with a slight edge for Obama.  Catholics account for nearly a quarter of U.S. adults.      The electoral clout of the Catholic vote is somewhat  diluted by its distribution.      According to a report by the Center for Applied Research in  the Apostolate at Georgetown University in Washington, nearly  four in 10 U.S. Catholics live in New York, California and  Texas, none of which are closely contested.      The report said states 'where the Catholic vote could make  a real difference are Florida, Ohio and Louisiana.'

        "Text": "    By Oleg Shchedrov      MOSCOW, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Uzbekistan's leader Islam Karimov,  who exploited a legal loophole to stay in office for a third  term, said on Wednesday that his Russian counterpart Vladimir  Putin could have used a similar tactic.      But Karimov quickly acknowledged that his advice had come a  bit too late.      Karimov, on a visit to Russia to discuss cooperation between  the two former Soviet republics, said Putin should have ordered  a referendum to extend the president's term in office.      'It is too late to talk about this now,' he said. 'But if  such an option worked, I am convinced that no one would regret  it. Such decision would be the most logical and correct,'  Karimov told reporters.      Putin, who was standing alongside Karimov when he made the  comments, did not react.      Russia is due to hold presidential elections in March. Putin  says he will step down next May in line with a constitutional  ban on a head of state serving more than two consecutive terms.  But Putin has said he plans to retain influence in the country.      Opinion polls suggest his close ally Dmitry Medvedev is  likely to be elected as the next president.      Karimov, accused by rights activists and Western governments  of tolerating no dissent in his Central Asia republic, won a  third term in an election last year that Western monitors said  was undemocratic.      Uzbekistan's constitution, like Russia's, bars a president  from serving three consecutive terms.      Karimov avoided the ban because in 2002 the country held a  referendum to extend presidential terms from 5 to 7 years. Legal  experts said that meant his time in office would be counted from  2002, not the point he first came to power.

        "Text": " (Repeats story published late on Monday)      PRAGUE, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Czech short-term interbank lending  rose while longer-term transactions nearly dried up as the   global financial crisis affected the Czech market, a  semi-annual central bank survey showed on Monday.      Foreign exchange activity weakened with overall daily  turnover declining slightly but spot transactions grew by more  than a third, a separate survey unveiled.      The global market turbulence has so far had relatively  limited impact on the central European country, with no banks  failing and no currency slump.      But markets have been hit and banks have grown reluctant to  lend to each other for longer maturities. Interbank money market  rates have jumped.      'The most significant among deposit operations were deposit  operations with a maturity up to one week (99 percent), in  particular overnight operations comprising 91 percent share of  the total turnover,' the bank said.      'This was caused mainly by tightening of banks' credit  policy,' it said.      The survey conducted in the week between Oct. 6 and Oct. 10  showed the daily average turnover of deposit operations rose to  86.6 billion crowns ($4.58 billion) from 77.2 billion in April.      Derivative transactions in interest rate swaps (IRS) and  forward rate agreements (FRA) dropped by 77 percent and 90  percent respectively due to widening spreads caused by high  volatility and risk aversion, the survey showed.        A separate central bank survey, conducted between Oct. 13  and Oct. 17, showed the daily average foreign exchange market  turnover dipped 1.8 percent from April to $8.86 billion. Spot  transactions grew 35.2 percent while forwards and swaps fell  14.1 percent.

        "Text": "    SINGAPORE, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Co  (ADNOC), Asia's third-largest term naphtha supplier, has sealed  its April 2009-March 2010 pentane and splitter naphtha grades at  $23.50-$26.00 a tonne to Middle East quotes on a free-on-board  (FOB) basis, traders said on Thursday.      The new premiums are at least five times higher that what  ADNOC had fetched for its January-December 2009 supplies,  concluded late last year.      'They didn't reduce the offers at all,' said one source in  the talks.       Details on its low-sulphur grade, offered at $24.50 a tonne  to Middle East quotes, FOB, for the same lifting period were not  immediately availble.       ADNOC had announced the offers last week, and its Asian  buyers were supposed to reply via fax by Feb. 18.
