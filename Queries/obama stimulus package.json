        "Text": " (Updates with meeting begins)      By Caren Bohan and Thomas Ferraro      WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama urged  skeptical Republicans to back his $825 billion economic  stimulus package on Tuesday during a visit to the U.S. Congress  on Capitol Hill.      Shortly before Obama arrived, House Minority Leader John  Boehner told fellow Republicans that in its current form, he  could not vote for the stimulus and encouraged fellow House  Republicans to vote against it, a Boehner spokesman said.      Obama conferred first with Republican members of the House  of Representatives and then was to go to the other side of the  Capitol to talk to Senate Republicans.      Republicans agree that the stumbling economy needs a rescue  package. But they complain the Democratic $550 billion spending  proposal is excessive while their proposal to cut taxes by  about $275 billion does not go far enough.      'We're anxious to help him. We think the country needs a  stimulus,' Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said  earlier on Tuesday on NBC's 'Today Show.'      A week after taking office, Obama faces an economic crisis  that seems to worsen by the day. U.S. consumer confidence  slipped to a record low and major U.S. companies are cutting  tends of thousands of jobs as financial industry troubles  continue to mount.  [ID:nT114397]      Obama's meeting with the Republican lawmakers comes the day  after Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner won Senate  confirmation and was sworn in.  [ID:nN26616671]      The Democratic-led House and Senate are expected to approve  the package by the middle of next month regardless of how many  Republicans embrace it.      McConnell said he believes Congress can hit the Democrats'  deadline of passing a rescue measure by mid-February. He said  Obama may have more difficulty with Democrats than Republicans  in getting a balanced package.      With the House set to vote on its version of the plan this  week, a co-chair of the coalition of fiscally conservative  Democrats said his 50-member group had concerns.  [ID:nN27437028]      Representative Charlie Melancon of Louisiana said his  colleagues want Obama to promise that the record federal  deficit is not further bloated by tax cuts or by increases in  mandatory government spending programs, like the Social  Security retirement program and Medicare health care program  for the elderly.      'The majority of us want to support the president and do a  stimulus package,' Melancon said. 'But we also have come to the  realization that every day that we don't get a commitment to  reel in this spending that we've been doing without paying for  it is a day ... that the problem gets worse.'           'WANTS TO HEAR THEIR IDEAS'      White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama wants to  listen to Republicans as part of his vow to seek consensus and  end traditional partisan gridlock.      'He wants to hear their ideas. If there are good ideas --  and I think he assumes there will be -- that we will look at  those ideas,' Gibbs told reporters on Monday.      Obama's aides have said three-quarters of the proposed new  spending, on health care, education and building new roads and  bridges, would work its way into the economy within 18 months.      A report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  said it would take a bit longer. CBO estimated that about 64  percent of the stimulus package would be reach the economy  within 19 months.

        "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - An $825 billion stimulus  bill aimed at reviving the U.S. economy presents an early test  of President Barack Obama's vow to overcome partisan politics  and forge consensus.      Following are scenarios on the political risks Obama and  his fellow Democrats in Congress as well as Republican  lawmakers face as they address the president's proposed package  of new federal spending and tax cuts.           RISKS FOR OBAMA AND DEMOCRATIC-LED CONGRESS      With Democrats in control of both Congress and the White  House for the first time since 1995, the stimulus package will  be their initial major test.      If the package proves effective, eases a deepening  recession and creates or saves millions of jobs, the new  president will be crowned a political hero. The same goes for  those who helped him turn the legislation into law.      If the package fails to jump-start the economy, a now  adoring public may turn against Obama and he could face a tough  time winning a second term in 2012.      Democrats in Congress could pay a price even sooner. The  entire House of Representatives and a third of the 100-member  Senate will be up for grabs in 2010. Unless the economy  improves markedly, expect Republicans to gain seats in both  chambers.           RISKS FOR OBAMA      Obama's main objective is to have the stimulus package  passed by Congress, a task helped by Democratic majorities in  both houses of Congress.      He also needs a bipartisan consensus of Republicans and  Democrats to pass it to bolster his image as a bridge builder.      Consensus will show voters that a campaign promise to end  overly partisan politics is being fulfilled.      If not, it will be seen as evidence that partisan divisions  defy Obama's ability to produce change, even during his  so-called honeymoon period.      In his inaugural address, he said, 'The old stale political  arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply.'      Commentators are watching for attempts by Republicans to  block the legislation through a filibuster in the Senate. Any  sustained attempt to do so would be read as defiance.      Obama also risks angering Democratic allies if they  perceive he works harder to satisfy Republican demands for a  bigger component of tax cuts in the bill than Democratic  objections.           RISKS FOR REPUBLICANS      Republican House Minority Leader John Boehner accused  Democrats on Thursday of wanting to push the stimulus bill  through without bothering to find common ground with  Republicans.      Some Republicans also fear the bill, which Democratic  leaders want passed by mid-February, is too big and is being  pushed through too fast.      But Republicans want to avoid been seen as obstructing a  bill that could revive the economy in a severe recession.      Their vote against former President George W. Bush's $700  billion bank bailout in October sent the stock market reeling  and hurt the presidential bid of Republican John McCain.      Republicans also want to push for tax cuts and resist  wanton government spending -- issues seen as core principles  for their party.      If they are perceived as being overly cooperative with  Democrats on those issues, they risk angering fiscally  conservative supporters.           RISKS FOR DEMOCRATS      Democratic lawmakers must peacefully resolve differences  within the economic package -- or risk riling members of their  own party, particularly those pushing for more ",

        "Text": "    By Caren Bohan and Jeremy Pelofsky      WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President-elect Barack Obama,  said on Friday that the latest grim unemployment report added  urgency to the need to pass his $800 billion stimulus proposal,  even as his efforts ran into difficulties in the U.S.  Congress.      Obama's top aides visited Capitol Hill to allay lawmakers'  concerns about his proposal, which would combine tax cuts, aid  to states and public works projects. The measure is aimed at  lifting the economy out of a recession that has already lasted  a year.      'Our expectation is that we will continue to hone and  refine our package over the next several weeks,' Obama told a  news conference, noting that the effort to craft the stimulus  package would be a collaboration with Congress.      Several Senate Democrats have raised questions about  whether some of the tax cuts for individuals and businesses  would have the desired impact and have called for more energy  tax breaks.      New York Sen. Charles Schumer played down those  differences, saying there was an awareness that time was of the  essence in passing the bill.      'While it's certainly true that we in Congress will have  input, and we certainly provided some suggestions and comments  in that meeting yesterday, the urgency of this economic crisis  is going to limit any haggling over competing approaches,'  Schumer said.      The Labor Department reported earlier on Friday that U.S.  employers slashed more than half a million jobs from their  payrolls in December, pushing the unemployment rate to 7.2  percent from 6.8 percent in November.      It was the highest jobless rate in nearly 16 years and the  report said the ailing economy hemorrhaged 2.6 million jobs for  all of 2008, the most since 1945.           'STARK REMINDER'      Obama called the jobs report a 'stark reminder' that the  government needed to act. 'Clearly the situation is dire. It is  deteriorating and it demands urgent and immediate action,' he  said.      There is broad consensus among Democrats and Republicans  that bold steps are needed to address the economy's woes. Obama  is also benefiting from a reservoir of goodwill as he prepares  to take office on Jan. 20 with high public approval ratings.      Still, signs are emerging that his goal of securing package  of the measure by mid-February will prove challenging.      In addition to some of the questions about the structure of  the tax cuts, a report from the Congressional Budget Office has  added to nervousness about the impact of the stimulus on  already skyrocketing budget deficits.      The CBO this week forecast a $1.2 trillion deficit for this  year, even before factoring in the stimulus.      Clearly aware of the need to use the bully pulpit to press  for passage of the stimulus, Obama warned in a speech on  Thursday that the U.S. recession could linger for years in the  absence of aggressive steps to jump start growth.      After meeting with Larry Summers, the incoming director of  the White House National Economic Council, and other Obama  aides, congressional Democrats echoed Obama's descriptions of  the situation as one that required urgency.      House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the stimulus plan would  help stem the kinds of job losses seen in the Labor  Department's report.      'We have to act very soon. We cannot wait until March. That  will be too late,' said Pelosi, a California Democrat.      House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told repor",

        "Text": "Everyone else is talking about what's in the $825 billion stimulus package, but here's the one thing I want to know: How can we let the government get away with calling it a \"stimulus\" in the first place?\n\nLet's break down the numbers on this with the help of those non-partisan, radical hate-mongers over at the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nAccording to the CBO, only $26 billion \u2014 just over 3 percent \u2014 will be spent this year. Another $110 billion \u2014 or 13 percent \u2014 will be spent next year. Which means that by the time President Obama's term is halfway through, just 16 percent of the money will have been spent.\n\nI thought President Obama said this is supposed to be a quick \"jolt\" to the economy?\n\nThe president has also billed the stimulus as an investment in America's infrastructure. And if that were true, I'd be all for it. I mean, I-95 here on the East Coast isn't exactly the autobahn. Yet only 3 percent \u2014 just $30 billion \u2014 of this entire package is dedicated to road and highway spending.\n\nThen you have the promise about creating \"green jobs\" and clean energy.\n\nAgain, you want to seriously get wind and solar and nuclear power off the ground, I'm in. But this isn't serious. Only 2 percent of the money is earmarked for clean energy and only 1/7th of that will be spent over the next 2 years.\n\nThe CBO tells us that billions of dollars are going to buy new computers and replace government cars with new alternative fuel vehicles. In all, the money is going to 150 different federal programs \u2014 from Amtrak to the TSA \u2014 and it's not clear a single new job will be created.\n\nAmerica, let's call a spade a spade: This package isn't meant to stimulate the economy, it's meant to reshape it.\n\nIf President Obama, Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the progressives really believe that socialism is the best way out of this mess and the best way forward for America, then make the case. Let's debate it and allow the American people to decide.\n\nBut what they're doing now \u2014 using fear to promote long-term changes to the country \u2014 is exactly the kind of thing that has led to the biggest deficit of all: The deficit of trust we now have in our leaders.\n\nWhat do you think?

        "Text": " (Fixes typos, 6th and 16 paragraphs)      By Caren Bohan and Thomas Ferraro      WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama urged  skeptical Republicans to back his $825 billion economic  stimulus package on Tuesday during a visit to the U.S. Congress  on Capitol Hill.      Shortly before Obama arrived, House Minority Leader John  Boehner told fellow Republicans that in its current form, he  could not vote for the stimulus and encouraged fellow House  Republicans to vote against it, a Boehner spokesman said.      Obama conferred first with Republican members of the House  of Representatives and then was to go to the other side of the  Capitol to talk to Senate Republicans.      Republicans agree that the stumbling economy needs a rescue  package. But they complain the Democratic $550 billion spending  proposal is excessive while their proposal to cut taxes by  about $275 billion does not go far enough.      'We're anxious to help him. We think the country needs a  stimulus,' Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said  earlier on Tuesday on NBC's 'Today Show.'      A week after taking office, Obama faces an economic crisis  that seems to worsen by the day. U.S. consumer confidence  slipped to a record low and major U.S. companies are cutting  tens of thousands of jobs as financial industry troubles  continue to mount.  [ID:nT114397]      Obama's meeting with the Republican lawmakers comes the day  after Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner won Senate  confirmation and was sworn in.  [ID:nN26616671]      The Democratic-led House and Senate are expected to approve  the package by the middle of next month regardless of how many  Republicans embrace it.      McConnell said he believes Congress can hit the Democrats'  deadline of passing a rescue measure by mid-February. He said  Obama may have more difficulty with Democrats than Republicans  in getting a balanced package.      With the House set to vote on its version of the plan this  week, a co-chair of the coalition of fiscally conservative  Democrats said his 50-member group had concerns.  [ID:nN27437028]      Representative Charlie Melancon of Louisiana said his  colleagues want Obama to promise that the record federal  deficit is not further bloated by tax cuts or by increases in  mandatory government spending programs, like the Social  Security retirement program and Medicare health care program  for the elderly.      'The majority of us want to support the president and do a  stimulus package,' Melancon said. 'But we also have come to the  realization that every day that we don't get a commitment to  reel in this spending that we've been doing without paying for  it is a day ... that the problem gets worse.'           'WANTS TO HEAR THEIR IDEAS'      White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama wants to  listen to Republicans as part of his vow to seek consensus and  end traditional partisan gridlock.      'He wants to hear their ideas. If there are good ideas --  and I think he assumes there will be -- that we will look at  those ideas,' Gibbs told reporters on Monday.      Obama's aides have said three-quarters of the proposed new  spending, on health care, education and building new roads and  bridges, would work its way into the economy within 18 months.      A report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  said it would take a bit longer. CBO estimated that about 64  percent of the stimulus package would reach the economy within  19 months.

        "Text": "    By Caren Bohan      WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama  will visit Capitol Hill on Tuesday to try to build momentum for  an $825 billion package he says is urgently needed to keep the  U.S. economy from sinking into an even deeper recession.      A week after taking office, Obama is grappling with an  economic crisis that seems to worsen by the day. U.S. companies  such as the heavy-equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. are  announcing huge layoffs as troubles in the housing and  financial sectors mount.      But Obama's meeting with lawmakers comes after the  president achieved one victory on the economic front: the  confirmation of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.      With his economic team in place, Obama hopes he can win  passage of the stimulus plan by mid-February.      The Capitol Hill meeting is somewhat unusual. Obama's  predecessor, former President George W. Bush rarely visited  Congress, preferring to send aides and sometimes his vice  president, Dick Cheney.      White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama's meetings  with House of Representatives and Senate lawmakers would be  less negotiating sessions than a chance to gather input.      'He wants to hear their ideas. If there are good ideas --  and I think he assumes there will be -- that we will look at  those ideas,' Gibbs told reporters.      The House may begin debate on the stimulus bill on Tuesday,  though any votes would not take place until Wednesday.      While there is broad support in the Democratic-led U.S.  Congress for bold measures to jump-start the economy,  Republicans and some moderate Democrats are worried about the  measure's huge price tag at a time when U.S. budget deficits  are already projected to stretch into the trillions.           REPUBLICANS QUESTION CONTRACEPTIVE, TUITION SPENDING      Some $275 billion of the package would go toward tax cuts.  The other $550 billion would pay for public works projects,  alternative energy initiatives and the bolstering of  unemployment benefits and other safety-net programs.      Obama hopes to win bipartisan support for the plan, but  some Republicans disagree with Obama on how the tax cuts should  be structured and have questioned whether some spending  elements in the plan, including money for contraceptive  programs and college tuition assistance, would provide any kind  of short-term jolt to the economy.      Responding to criticism that the package contained too  little immediate help, Obama's aides have said three-quarters  of the spending would work its way into the economy within the  first 18 months.      According to a report issued late on Monday by the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, about 64 percent of  the stimulus package would be poured into the economy within 19  months.      Obama has sought to emphasize that he wants to listen to  Republican and Democratic ideas.      The Democratic tax cut plan would direct benefits more  toward lower-income workers, even those who do not pay income  taxes, while the House Republicans would help all taxpayers.      When some Republicans pressed Obama on Friday to change  that part of the plan, he replied that he won the election and  was sticking to the plan he had campaigned on.      Gibbs said the comment was meant to be light-hearted and  was not an attempt to pursue 'cowboy diplomacy' in the  negotiations.      In addition to the stimulus package, another issue that  could come up at the Capitol Hill meeting is",

        "Text": "    By Caren Bohan and Jeremy Pelofsky      WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President-elect Barack Obama  said on Friday that the latest grim unemployment report added  urgency to the need to pass his $800 billion stimulus proposal,  even as his efforts ran into difficulties in the U.S.  Congress.      Obama's top aides visited Capitol Hill to allay lawmakers'  concerns about his proposal, which would combine tax cuts, aid  to states and public works projects. The measure is aimed at  lifting the economy out of a recession that has already lasted  a year.      'Our expectation is that we will continue to hone and  refine our package over the next several weeks,' Obama told a  news conference, noting that the effort to craft the stimulus  package would be a collaboration with Congress.      Several Senate Democrats have raised questions about  whether some of the tax cuts for individuals and businesses  would have the desired impact and have called for more energy  tax breaks.      New York Sen. Charles Schumer played down those  differences, saying there was an awareness that time was of the  essence in passing the bill.      'While it's certainly true that we in Congress will have  input, and we certainly provided some suggestions and comments  in that meeting yesterday, the urgency of this economic crisis  is going to limit any haggling over competing approaches,'  Schumer said.      The Labor Department reported earlier on Friday that U.S.  employers slashed more than half a million jobs from their  payrolls in December, pushing the unemployment rate to 7.2  percent from 6.8 percent in November.      It was the highest jobless rate in nearly 16 years and the  report said the ailing economy hemorrhaged 2.6 million jobs for  all of 2008, the most since 1945.           'STARK REMINDER'      Obama called the jobs report a 'stark reminder' that the  government needed to act. 'Clearly the situation is dire. It is  deteriorating and it demands urgent and immediate action,' he  said.      There is broad consensus among Democrats and Republicans  that bold steps are needed to address the economy's woes. Obama  is also benefiting from a reservoir of goodwill as he prepares  to take office on Jan. 20 with high public approval ratings.      Still, signs are emerging that his goal of securing package  of the measure by mid-February will prove challenging.      In addition to some of the questions about the structure of  the tax cuts, a report from the Congressional Budget Office has  added to nervousness about the impact of the stimulus on  already skyrocketing budget deficits.      The CBO this week forecast a $1.2 trillion deficit for this  year, even before factoring in the stimulus.      Clearly aware of the need to use the bully pulpit to press  for passage of the stimulus, Obama warned in a speech on  Thursday that the U.S. recession could linger for years in the  absence of aggressive steps to jump start growth.      After meeting with Larry Summers, the incoming director of  the White House National Economic Council, and other Obama  aides, congressional Democrats echoed Obama's descriptions of  the situation as one that required urgency.      House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the stimulus plan would  help stem the kinds of job losses seen in the Labor  Department's report.      'We have to act very soon. We cannot wait until March. That  will be too late,' said Pelosi, a California Democrat.      House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told report",

        "Text": "    * Bad economic news adds sense of urgency      * Republicans want greater say, add tax cut proposals       (Updates after meeting)      By Ross Colvin and Matt Spetalnick      WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama  said on Friday he expected an $825 billion stimulus package for  the ailing U.S. economy to be approved by his target of  mid-February and personally urged congressional leaders to work  swiftly to pass it.      'We are experiencing an unprecedented economic crisis that  has to be dealt with and dealt with rapidly,' Obama told  reporters as he met with the lawmakers at the White House.      With new figures showing the U.S. economy sinking deeper  into recession, Obama is anxious to create bipartisan approach  to jolting the economy out of its worst crisis since the Great  Depression nearly 80 years ago.      Republicans, who have voiced concern over the shape of the  package and accuse Obama's majority Democrats of failing to  take their views into account, left the meeting saying they had  given Obama ideas of their own on new tax cuts.      Winning Republican support for the package will be an early  test of Obama's promise to forge consensus and overcome the  partisan politics that bitterly divided Washington under his  Republican predecessor George W. Bush.      'I recognize that there are still some difference around  the table and between the administration and members of  Congress about particular details on the plan,' Obama said.      But he added, 'It appears that we are on target to make our  Presidents Day weekend (goal for the stimulus plan).'      House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she too  believed Congress was on track to have a bill to be signed by  the president before the Presidents Day holiday on Feb. 16.  'Again, if not, there will be no recess,' Pelosi, a California  Democrat, told reporters after the meeting.           REPUBLICAN TAX PROPOSALS      Asked whether he was worried that Republicans would block  the stimulus package, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry  Reid said 'No.'      Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and House  Republican leader John Boehner also attended the meeting. They  said their proposals included tax cuts for workers and new tax  deductions for small businesses.      Republicans are upset at how the Obama administration plans  to spend the stimulus money, saying the $550 billion in  government spending would add too much to the deficit and that  the $275 billion earmarked for tax cuts is too little.      Obama says his plan aims to create or save 3 to 4 million  jobs in the U.S economy, which has been in a yearlong recession  since the collapse of the housing market sparked a global panic  over bank losses that in turn froze credit markets.      Wall Street was scrutinizing the outcome of the meeting   for signs that the stimulus package will be passed soon.      Worries over potential delays have helped push stocks  lower. Major U.S. indexes were down amid worries over corporate  profits and concerns that the global economic slowdown shows no  signs of ending.      The new president has said that rescuing the U.S. economy  is his No. 1 priority, and analysts say that, for now, his  first term was likely to be judged on his ability to restore  economic and financial stability.           DAILY ECONOMIC BRIEFING      In a change from Bush, Obama has added an economic   briefing to his daily schedule so that he can get the latest ",

        "Text": " (Incorporates OBAMA-ECONOMY/)      By Caren Bohan      WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama  will visit Congress on Tuesday to try to persuade reluctant  Republicans to support a $825 billion package he says is  essential to resuscitate a plunging economy.      A week after taking office, Obama faces an economic crisis  that seems to worsen by the day. Major U.S. companies cut tens  of thousands of jobs on Monday and housing and financial  industry troubles continue to mount.   [ID:nT114397]      Obama's meeting with the Republican lawmakers comes after  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner won Senate confirmation,  although 34 although Senators voted against him.   [ID:nN26616671]      With his economic team in place, Obama hopes he can win  passage of the stimulus plan by mid-February.      Although the Democratic president does not need broad  Republican support, the minority party could put up procedural  hurdles to slow the plan's progress.      White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama's meetings  with House of Representatives and Senate Republicans would be  less a negotiating session than a chance to gather input.      'He wants to hear their ideas. If there are good ideas, and  I think he assumes there will be, that we will look at those  ideas,' Gibbs told reporters.      The House and Senate are expected to approve the package by  the middle of next month regardless of how many Republicans  embrace it.      While there is strong support in the Democratic-led   Congress for bold measures to jump-start the economy,  Republicans differ with Obama on how the tax cuts should be  structured and have criticized his spending proposals at a time  of high budget deficits.      U.S. stocks opened higher on Tuesday, buoyed partly on  hopes for swift action by Geithner, the former head of the New  York Federal Reserve.  [ID:nLR704192]        REPUBLICAN QUESTIONS      Some $275 billion of the package would go toward tax cuts.  The other $550 billion would pay for public works projects,  alternative energy initiatives and would bolster unemployment  benefits and other safety-net programs.   [ID:nN27437028]      Republicans have seized on some spending items, including  money for contraceptive programs and college tuition assistance  which they say would not further create jobs in the near term.      Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, speaking on NBC's  Today show, agreed it was important to throw the economy a  lifeline but said Democrats had tilted the package toward  excessive spending.      'We're anxious to help him. We think the country needs a  stimulus,' said McConnell, a Kentucky Republican.      'Listening to what he wanted we think we may be closer to  that, oddly enough, than the Democratic majority, which seems  to be pulling in the direction of less tax relief and things  like fixing up the (National) Mall.'      Obama's aides have said three-quarters of the spending  would work its way into the economy within 18 months.      According to a report issued late on Monday by the  Congressional Budget Office, about 64 percent of the stimulus  package would be poured into the economy within 19 months.      The Democratic tax cut plan would direct benefits more  toward lower-income workers, even non-income tax payers, while  the House Republicans would help all taxpayers.      When some Republicans pressed Obama on Friday to change  that part of the plan, he replied that he won the election and  was sti",

        "Text": " (Refiling with updated headline)      Nov 5 (Reuters) - U.S. president-elect Barack Obama, hoping  to boost a struggling economy, has proposed a stimulus package  that some experts estimate could cost as much as $190 billion.      At the same time, the United States is facing record budget  deficits of at least $500 billion. Some analysts say the  deficit could go as high as $1 trillion next year.           Obama has said he would:      --Enact a windfall profits tax on oil companies to give  taxpayers an energy rebate.      --Give businesses a $3,000 refundable tax credit for each  new full-time employee hired in the United States over the next  two years.      --Allow small business to immediately write off up to  $250,000 in spending for new equipment and property through the  end of 2009. The stimulus package enacted earlier this year  provided for the $250,000 investment expensing limit only  through the end of this year.     --Eliminate capital gains taxes on investments in small  businesses.     --Make $25 billion immediately available for the  construction and repair of roads, bridges, schools and other  infrastructure.      --Provide $25 billion to states to help them cope with the  economic downturn without having to raise property taxes or cut  vital services.      --Make $50 billion in loan guarantees available and keep  other options open to help U.S. automobile manufacturers retool  and develop a new generation of fuel-efficient cars. Congress  has made $25 billion available.     --Implement a 90-day foreclosure moratorium for homeowners  making good faith efforts to pay their mortgage debt.     --Extend unemployment insurance for long-term jobless  workers who have exhausted their benefits, and temporarily  suspend taxes on those benefits.     --Temporarily allow penalty-free withdrawals of 15 percent  from tax-preferred retirement accounts up to $10,000.     --Suspend rules requiring retirees to begin withdrawing from  retirement accounts six months after they reach the age of 70.     --Increase home heating cost aid.     --Instruct the secretaries of the Treasury and Housing and  Urban Development to use their existing authority to more  aggressively modify the terms of mortgages.     --Reform the bankruptcy code to assist homeowners and remove  legal impediments to encouraging more mortgage restructuring.     --In the longer term, Obama would roll back some of Bush's  tax cuts for the wealthy. He proposed a permanent tax cut of  $500 for most individual workers and $1,000 for families. He  also would eliminate taxes for seniors making up to $50,000.      --To help jump-start the economy, the tax cuts would be  expedited through refunds based on 2007 tax returns. He would  also provide a 10 percent refundable tax credit for mortgage  interest to taxpayers who do not itemize their returns.     --On trade, Obama has promised to review the North American  Free Trade Agreement and use trade agreements to advance good  labor and environmental standards around the world. He has also  promised to end tax breaks that encourage companies to shift  U.S. jobs overseas.

Broadly  speaking it has the right priorities to create jobs that will  jump-start our economy and transform it for the 21st century,'  Obama said of the more than $800 billion bill at a rally in  Elkhart, Indiana.      'I can say with complete confidence that endless delay or  paralysis in Washington in the face of this crisis will only  bring deepening disaster,' Obama said.

'We expect that it will be on the high end of our estimates  but will not be as high as some economists have recommended  because of the constraints and concerns we have about the  existing deficit,' Obama told a news conference.      Obama economic advisers have put a pricetag of around $775  billion on the package, but some economists have said it should  be as much as $1 trillion to be effective.
