        "Text": "    By Kim Dixon      WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate passed an  amendment on Thursday that would bar regulators from requiring  broadcasters to give equal time to all points of view, a ban  strongly supported by some Republican lawmakers.      The legislative amendment, sponsored by Republican Sen. Jim  DeMint of South Carolina, would prevent the Federal  Communications Commission from reimposing the so-called  Fairness Doctrine to all broadcasters. It was repealed more  than 20 years ago.      Aides to President Barack Obama have said he has no  intention of trying to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine, but  that has not stopped some Republicans from raising the issue.      Free Press, a media advocacy group that opposes bringing  back the rule, said the issue was a distraction.      'An uncharitable interpretation is that they (Republicans)  need an issue that unites their base and is an easy talking  point for conservative radio,' said Ben Scott, policy director  at Free Press.      Conservative talk show icon Rush Limbaugh recently decried  the doctrine in a Wall Street Journal editorial.      DeMint said the doctrine violates the First Amendment and  would suppress free speech by letting the government decide  what is fair political dialogue.      An appeals court made that ruling, leading the FCC to  repeal it in 1987.      Scott's group agrees the government should not be decided  what is fair and balanced, but said there is no clamor to bring  it back.      The amendment was attached to an unrelated bill on voting  rights for Washington, D.C. residents. Whether it will survive  in the U.S. House of Representatives is uncertain.

It's your chance to call in and argue with John!\n\nToday John Kerry weighed in on an issue that is now all the rage among liberal politicians. The issue is called the Fairness Doctrine.\n\nThis is a rule that used to exist in broadcasting \u2014 radio and TV \u2014 which required that no opinion could be expressed without a countervailing opinion presented immediately. It was the old salt and pepper rule. If you were on the air with a salt shaker, you had to have a pepper shaker.\n\nNow what this is all about is talk radio. Liberals are complaining that their brand of talk radio fails whenever someone tries to put it on the air, and they have decided the answer is to shut up conservative talk radio. This is the \"Hush Rush\" movement.\n\nLiberals are angry that so many of you listen to talk radio \u2014 conservative talk radio \u2014 and that you cannot be dragged over to a liberal talk show. This argument ignores the fact that something like 20 million people a week listen to NPR, which is the very definition of liberal.\n\nWhat it also ignores is that the Fairness Doctrine applies to all broadcast, not just radio and especially not just talk radio. Liberals should be on notice it will apply to all the liberals who now operate on the airwaves in network TV news, in certain quarters of cable news and, of course, in entertainment TV.\n\nFace it. Liberals own Hollywood. Virtually every movie would be subject to the Fairness Doctrine. Think Al Gore's \"Inconvenient Truth\" could stand up to that scrutiny or Michael Moore's \"Fahrenheit 9/11\"? Not a chance.\n\nDo you think HBO can stand to have the Fairness Doctrine applied to what it airs? Bill Maher is going to have an awful time trying to conform to the Fairness Doctrine, and I can't think of a liberal anywhere who wants to shut him up.\n\nWhat John Kerry and Dianne Feinstein and Dick Durbin are asking for is to only restrict the broadcasting that conservatives do, mainly talk radio, though I have no doubt they have their plans for FOX News, too.\n\nThis is an attempt to take over the airwaves with liberal thought and make sure nothing else gets on. It's already a huge imbalance in favor of liberal thought on the airwaves, and the effort now is to make certain that echo chamber of so-called progressives is undisturbed by any irritating arguments from the right, or debates liberals can't win.\n\nThis is liberals in action. When you can't win the debate, make certain there is no debate. That is what the resurgence of the Fairness Doctrine debate is all about.\n\nThat's My Word.\n\nWatch John Gibson weekdays at 5 p.m. ET on \"The Big Story\" and send your comments to: myword@foxnews.com\n\nRead Your Word",

The public offer was raised to 25 Swedish crowns per Boss  Media share from the original bid of 19 crowns per share  announced early this month. The raised offer implied a valuation  of Boss Media of about 131 million euros ($190 million).

        "Text": "    NEW DELHI, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The son of a wealthy Indian  arms dealer, whose drunken driving killed six people a decade  ago, was jailed for five years on Friday in a case seen as a test  of Indian courts' fairness in judging the rich and powerful.      Sanjeev Nanda, the grandson of a former navy chief, pleaded  innocent in the case that saw the convict's family being accused  of trying to bribe witnesses into lying.      The media kept up pressure on the high-profile case in a  country where the judiciary is often accused of favouring the  wealthy and powerful.      'I found Sanjeev Nanda guilty,' judge Vinod Kumar said,  sentencing him to five years in prison.      The court also jailed three other defendants for six months  to a year on charges of destroying evidence in the case which  came to be known as the BMW case after the car Nanda was driving.      Nanda's lawyer said they would appeal before a higher court  within a week.      Prosecutors said Nanda, who was a student of the Wharton  School of Business and on holiday in India, was returning from a  party with two friends when he ran over seven people. Six,  including three policemen, were killed.   (Reporting by R.

        "Text": "    TEHRAN, Nov 21 (Reuters) - The head of the U.N. nuclear  watchdog Mohamed ElBaradei should report on Iran's nuclear  programme neutrally and with fairness, an influential cleric  said on Friday after this week's report on Iran's atomic work.      Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, also a former president, said in a  sermon to worshippers at Friday prayers broadcast on state radio  that U.S. accusations that Iran was diverting its nuclear  programme to military purposes were not backed up by evidence.      Washington and its allies accuse Tehran of seeking to build  nuclear warheads under cover of a civilian atomic programme, a  charge Iran denies, insisting its aim is to generate electricity  so it can save more of its vast oil and gas reserves for export.      'We have announced everything. The (International Atomic  Energy) Agency (IAEA) has acknowledged ... that we have had no  diversion,' Rafsanjani said.      'But the Americans have raised a claim that we are not  announcing everything. Well, a claim of this nature has no  limits in scope and anybody can make such a claim in relation to  anything. They are not giving any document to support their  claim.'      The IAEA presented its latest report on Iran on Wednesday,  saying the Islamic Republic planned to start installing another  3,000 centrifuges early next year, adding to 3,800 already  enriching uranium and another 2,200 being gradually introduced.      The West worries about the enrichment programme because it  can have both civilian and military uses.       'As for Mr ElBaradei, whenever he speaks he does it  equivocally ... (saying) that, for instance, Iran is not letting  the agency inspect the Arak heavy water facility,' he said,  referring to one of Iran's disputed nuclear sites.      'This is again an example of trying to use compulsion in  relations to us. We ask the agency to judge neutrally and fairly  and avoid speaking equivocally,' the former president said.      'We will not let the certain right of a revolutionary and  innocent nation be trampled,' Rafsanjani added.      The IAEA has been investigating allegations that Iran  carried out research into nuclear warheads. The accusations were  based on intelligence which came from a laptop computer spirited  out of Iran by a defector in 2004 and passed on to Washington,  from some other Western states, and from IAEA inquiries.      Iran dismisses the allegations and says U.N. inspectors have  access in line with legal requirements to verify what it says is  the peaceful nature of the Islamic Republic's plans.

Henry Waxman, D-Calif., is taking the call to a new level. The article said aides to the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee met last week with Federal Communications Commission staff to discuss ways to not only enact those policies but give Waxman's panel greater oversight over the Internet.\n\n\"It's all about diversity in media,\" the Spectator quoted a House energy committee staff member as saying. \"Does one radio station or one station group control four of the five most powerful outlets in one community? ... Does one heavily trafficked Internet site present one side of an issue and not link to sites that present alternative views?\"\n\nThe committee vigorously denied the report. A spokesperson called the account \"fictitious\" in a statement to FOX News.\n\n\"The American Spectator report is false and was written without any documentation or attribution,\" the statement said.\n\nFCC spokesman David Fiske also disputed the claims in the piece, saying, \"We're not sure that it's an accurate article.\"\n\nAnalysts treated the report with a dose of skepticism as well -- but noted that the idea is not entirely foreign. Robert McDowell, the current FCC commissioner and a Bush appointee, warned in an interview last year that Fairness Doctrine advocates might try to extend their policies to the Web.\n\nIf that is the case, foes and supporters of the doctrine alike say policing fairness on the Internet will prove impossible. Plus they say it's unnecessary and well beyond the scope of the original policy.\n\n\"This borders between stupidity and sheer insanity,\" said conservative radio talk show host Mike Gallagher, when told about the Spectator report. \"I can't wait until they try to monitor how many conservative posts are on a thread versus how many liberal posts are on a thread.\"\n\nHe added that Democrats would be only neutralizing dominant liberal blogs that currently help them. He predicted any move to extend Fairness Doctrine principles to the Web would \"blow sky high.\"\n\nThe Fairness Doctrine was adopted in 1949 and held that broadcasters were obligated to provide opposing points of views on controversial issues of national importance. It was halted under the Reagan administration.\n\nThe policy is the scourge of conservative radio hosts, who say it would allow the federal government to skew content on their programs. Democratic lawmakers, some of whom have renewed the call to reinstate the doctrine in recent weeks, say it would bring accountability to the airwaves and help increase the number of liberal shows in a landscape dominated by conservatives like Rush Limbaugh.\n\nSteve Rendall, a Fairness Doctrine supporter and senior analyst with Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, said liberals and conservatives both over-state the impact the doctrine would have on media content.\n\nHe said most talk shows, even those on the right, already comply with the requirements, which he said tread \"very lightly\" and do not call for absolute balance on the airwaves.\n\nBut he said there is \"no justification\" for applying the doctrine to the Internet, or any other form of media -- since the doctrine was only meant to apply standards to the privileged holders of limited broadcast licenses. The Internet, by contrast, has infinite outlets for opinion.\n\n\"Cable and Internet are, at least theoretically, limitless in the number of voices that they can present, and it's not at all the same as broadcast,\" Rendall said.\n\nBrent Bozell, president of the conservative Media Research Center, said it would be \"impossible\" to regulate balance and neutrality on the Internet. He said he thinks Democrats eventually want to bring those standards to the Web but are struggling to rally the political will to revisit the Fairness Doctrine.\n\nHe said any legislative efforts to reinstate it will probably occur behind closed doors, since doing it out in the open could cause political repercussions.\n\nThe Spectator reported that Waxman's advisers were discussing ways to implement Fairness Doctrine policies without actually calling it the \"Fairness Doctrine.\"\n\nOther Democrats have openly called for a modern-day Fairness Doctrine in recent weeks, though they were referring more to radio than the Internet.\n\n\"I absolutely think it's time to be bringing accountability to the airwaves,\" Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., told liberal radio host Bill Press two weeks ago. She said she expects hearings soon on reviving the policy, though her office has reportedly backed off that prediction. (Stabenow's husband, Tom Athans, is and has been an executive at several liberal radio talk groups.)\n\nAnd Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, told Press last week: \"We gotta get the Fairness Doctrine back in law again.\"\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, a spokesman said then-candidate Barack Obama did not favor reinstating the Fairness Doctrine. But Obama's White House aides are now leaving open the question.\n\nAsked if the White House would rule out imposing the doctrine on \"FOX News Sunday,\" senior adviser David Axelrod ducked.\n\n\"I'm going to leave that issue to Julius Genachowski, our new head of the FCC ... and the president to discuss. So I don't have an answer for you now,\" he said.\n\nDespite the speculation, nobody has introduced a bill this session to reinstate those policies.\n\nMeanwhile, Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe introduced a bill this year to prevent reinstatement of the Fairness Doctrine.\n\nFOXNews.com's Judson Berger and FOX News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",
