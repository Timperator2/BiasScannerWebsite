        "Text": "Can you believe Sarah Palin is still getting trashed eight days after the election? Can you believe she's still getting as much or more attention than President-elect Obama? Something is going on here.\n\nWednesday, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd ran yet another analysis of Governor Palin. But why? She lost. She's not going to be vice president.\n\nIn her column just out, she wrote: \"After her brutal transformation by the McCain campaign into a shopaholic, whack-job diva, Palin is now trying to unmake that makeover and morph from uptown cloistered girl back to down-home accessible girl.\"\n\nMs. Dowd goes on to cite reporting by The Washington Post that the governor spent even more money, this time on silk boxer shorts for her husband and spray tanners, above and beyond the original $150,000 already reported.\n\nNow, my question is: Who cares? I believe Palin when she says the RNC bought the clothes.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGOV. SARAH PALIN: The criticism that, you know, I took time out to run into Neiman Marcus or Sax, I don't think I've ever set foot in either one of those stores and, of course, didn't know the New York stylist whom they had hired or anything else.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWell, \"Talking Points\" is simply amazed the press is still talking about this in the face of a dangerous economy and the anticipation of a relatively inexperienced new president.\n\nBut there are some lessons here, and the first one is about loyalty. After Sarah Palin was hammered by some McCain staffers, it took the senator six days before he publicly stood up for her. That happened on the Leno program last night.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: I'm just very proud to have had Sarah Palin and her family, a wonderful family.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOK, but let me ask you something. If you knew a friend was being humiliated, would it take you six days to defend her? If so, you're not much of a friend.\n\nOn \"The Radio Factor\" Wednesday, Juan Williams said he thinks McCain just doesn't care about the issue, and that rings true. But McCain should have stood up sooner, no question.\n\nAs for Governor Palin, the liberal press wants to destroy her mainly because of her pro-life belief. And some Republicans believe she's not smart enough to run the country. So she continues to get it from both sides.\n\nBut the very fact that we are still talking about Sarah Palin proves the woman remains a force in America. It will be fascinating to see what happens to her.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nOur pal Donald Trump often does some nice things with his assets, and here's another one. He's been housing actress Jennifer Hudson and her family after the brutal murders of her mother, brother and young nephew. Mr. Trump's putting them up for free at one of his hotels, and for that, he's a patriot.\n\nOn the pinhead front, actor Brad Garrett, who gained a measure of fame in \"Everybody Loves Raymond,\" is being investigated by the police after this confrontation:\n\nClick here to watch \"Pinheads & Patriots.\"\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're a big star, man.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, leave him alone.\n\nBRAD GARRETT, ACTOR: That's enough. That's enough.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I didn't touch you.\n\nGARRETT: Oh, you would love that, right.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You did.\n\nGARRETT: Oh, did I really? Go get a real job.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nNow, we sympathize with all famous people because the paparazzi are ruthless. But Mr. Garrett needs to calm down and stop being a pinhead.",

        "Text": "Wednesday morning, NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell reported that Governor Palin's clothing is very expensive, and Ms. Mitchell is apparently upset about that. It's the usual from NBC News, trying to diminish the McCain-Palin ticket any way they can.\n\nBut far more troubling \u2014 far more troubling \u2014 was an interview Tuesday on CNN. Stay with me here because this is very important.\n\nWriting in the National Review this week, Byron York said: \"Watching press coverage of the Republican candidate for vice president, it's sometimes hard to decide whether Sarah Palin is incompetent, stupid, unqualified, corrupt, backward, or all of the above. Palin, the governor of Alaska, has faced more criticism than any vice presidential candidate since 1988.\"\n\nNow Mr. York was clearly criticizing press bias in that paragraph, no question about that. Well, shortly after the article appeared, Sarah Palin was interviewed by CNN reporter Drew Griffin, and here's what happened:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDREW GRIFFIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Governor, you've been mocked in the press. The press has been pretty hard on you. The Democrats have been pretty hard on you. But also some conservatives have been pretty hard on you as well. The National Review had a story saying that, you know, I can't tell if Sarah Palin is incompetent, stupid, unqualified, corrupt, or all of the above.\n\nSARAH PALIN: Who wrote that one?\n\nGRIFFIN: That was in the National Review. I don't have the author.\n\nPALIN: I'd like to talk to that person.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nShe doesn't have to talk to that person. Isn't that incredible?\n\nNow Griffin, the guy, totally distorted what York wrote in the article, and then he ambushes Palin with the distortion. She has no idea what he's talking about.\n\nNow I haven't been critical of CNN during the campaign. They've been pretty honest in their coverage, I believe. But that was off the chart dishonest.\n\nSo we called CNN for comment very early in the morning. We said look, you know, are you going to apologize? What are you going to do? They wouldn't comment. Apparently, there's no apology in the works, no retraction. It's unbelievable. It's hard to believe. In fact, the whole campaign has been hard to believe.\n\n\"Talking Points\" is amazed at how dishonest the American press reportage has been. Yes, there's been nasty stuff from both sides, no doubt. But with the mainstream media solidly behind Barack Obama, I think that's worth about five percentage points for him in the popular vote. I could be wrong.\n\nBut CNN was definitely wrong in what they did to Sarah Palin. It's outrageous.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nAs you may have heard, I signed up for another contract cycle here at FOX News. My boss, Roger Ailes, is a patriot for allowing me to continue. At least to me he is.\n\nNow I gave two interviews Tuesday on the subject: one to Richard Huff at the New York Daily News and the other to our pal Howard Kurtz at The Washington Post.\n\nNow, I'm like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football with Lucy holding it. I'm never going to learn.\n\nHuff did a fair story, but he listed my salary, which he got drastically wrong. But it doesn't matter. All the Web sites picked it up and, once again, falsehood becomes fact.\n\nKurtz wrote mostly about some negative aspects of \"The Factor,\" which is what The Post likes to do. Howard didn't do anything unprofessional. He simply gave his bosses what they want: negative stuff.\n\nFor example, Kurtz wrote that \"The Radio Factor\" is less successful than the TV \"Factor.\" Well, most media, Howard, is less successful than the TV \"Factor,\" including The Washington Post and CNN, where you work.\n\nThe fact is, \"The Radio Factor\" is one of the most profitable radio franchises in the history of the medium, but Howard wanted to find a negative, and he did. By the way, as I said, Howard also works for CNN.\n\nI'm not calling Mr. Huff and Mr. Kurtz pinheads. They don't deserve that designation off what they wrote, but both men could have done a little bit better on this one.\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads & Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

        "Text": "  (Updates with more opinion polls)      By Jeff Mason      ALBUQUERQUE, Sept 8 (Reuters) - John McCain's backers are  reveling in the crowds his White House campaign has drawn in  the 10 days since he made Alaska's little-known governor, Sarah  Palin, his running mate.      'Governor, you're a breath of fresh air,' Ken Starrs, a    police lieutenant from Corpus Christi, Texas, told Palin, 44,  at a Detroit ceremony where the political pair picked up an  endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police union.      'She's very real,' he said after they shook hands.      Critics have questioned the 72-year-old Republican  senator's judgment in choosing a vice presidential candidate  without high-profile experience. Palin has been governor since  2006. Her previous public service was as a small-town mayor.      Democrat Barack Obama, 47, has raised far more cash in the  race for the Nov. 4 election. He has sought to paint McCain as  heir to Republican President George W. Bush's unpopular  policies. But McCain and Palin are holding their own.      Five public opinion polls released on Monday showed McCain  and Obama essentially dead even as they headed into the final  eight weeks of the race for the White House.      McCain has decided to keep Palin with him on the trail a  few more days before sending her out to campaign on her own.      'I saw a new McCain today, and I'm very excited,' said  Bonnie Norris, 63, after a lively performance by the Arizona  senator in Albuquerque. 'He's opened up more. He's more  dynamic.'      Some 15,000 people turned out to see McCain name his vice  presidential pick in Dayton, Ohio, on Aug. 29. To soaring music  and high drama, Palin entered the stage with her family like a  new, if somewhat baffled, rock star.           'SARAH, SARAH'      Not known for the inspiring oratory that is Obama's  trademark, McCain has since soaked up some of the energy  generated by Palin, who is greeted with shouts of 'Sarah,  Sarah' at most rallies.      'She's ignited America,' McCain declared in New Mexico on  Saturday night. 'The response to her has been overwhelming.'      At the Albuquerque rally, which packed more than 6,000  people into a tight hall, McCain's 'Straight Talk Express' bus  pulled up and dropped the candidates in front of the crowd  while Van Halen's song 'Right Now' blasted over loudspeakers.      The many signs ranged from 'Sarah, you had USA at hello' to  'Lipstick wearing pitbulls for McCain,' a reference to her quip  at the Republican convention suggesting lipstick was the only  thing to distinguish a pit bull from a 'hockey mom.'      Aides said their relationship was cementing quickly.      'They knew each other a little (before), obviously, but  they're getting to know each other well,' said Mark Salter,  McCain's closest aide and speechwriter.      'They're very excited about these rallies. They're talking  about them, they're looking at each other for marks. You know,  they're talking to each other about policy, about energy policy  and a couple other things. They're getting along very well.'      On the day McCain introduced Palin as his running mate, she  referred to him as 'senator' and to his wife Cindy as 'Mrs.  McCain.' Do they call each other by first names now? 'Yeah, I  believe so,' Salter said.      Palin, who precedes him now at rallies with a rousing  reference to McCain's service as a Vietnam prisoner of war,  added a new bit to her introduction on Friday in Michigan: 'I  am honored ",

        "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Sept 18 (Reuters Life!) - From Sarah Palin's  trademark Kazuo Kawasaki glasses, to gun-toting action figuresand a large pumpkin carved with her face, the newcomer in the  U.S. election campaign has sparked a rush of online novelties.      Other shoppers are rushing to copy the style of the  Republican party's vice-presidential candidate ahead of the   Nov. 4 vote.      Figures show online sales of items related to Palin, the  governor of Alaska and self-described 'hockey mom', have shot  up over fivefold, overtaking sales of the election's three male  contenders, and prompting a far wider range of merchandise.      Demand may be muted for a $125 pumpkin hand-carved with  Palin's face, but Palin wigs for $75 could be more appealing  while a hockey puck featuring her photo, the U.S. flag and  reading 'Hockey Moms for Sarah Palin' is proving popular at  $15.      A piece of uneaten toast titled 'Sarah Palin on my toast! A  sign? You be the judge,' was up for sale on the online auction  site eBay, with 24 bids and one unbelievable offer of $7,100.      Karen Bard, an eBay spokeswoman, said the number of Palin  related items has surged since Republican John McCain on Aug.  29 named Palin, 44, as his running mate.      'The day after McCain popped the big question to Palin, 105  Palin items were listed on eBay. With the momentum from the  Republican National Convention, Palin items took off peaking at  554 listing in one day,' Bard said.      She said over the past 30 days on eBay, over 4,000 Palin  items have sold for an average of $5.61, with the highest item,  an autographed photo of mother-of-five Palin, getting $499.99.      A quick check found 1,500 items related to Palin for sale  on eBay, outnumbering 298 for Democratic vice-presidential  candidate Joe Biden, while Democrat Barack Obama had 4,500  items to his name and McCain 1,750.           FROM WEIRD TO WIGS      Obama and McCain can boast a vast array of books, posters,  T-shirts and badges but Bard said Palin supporters were  exercising their creative rights and freedom of speech by  listing thousands of different items, mainly to show support.      These included Sarah Palin Barbie dolls and action figures,  Palin beer Steins, T-shirts galore, and Palin thong underwear.      CafePress, an online store for independent retailers and  political merchandise, was running a graph showing sales for  Palin goods had overtaken items related to the others.      In the week ending Sept 13, her first week on the CafePress  chart, Palin items accounted for 32 percent of weekly sales,  topping McCain at 29 percent, Obama at 28 percent and Biden at  5 percent.      But it is not just the bizarre that is in demand. Followers  of fashion want the former beauty queen's looks.      Italee Optics, the U.S. distributor of Palin's rimless  frames by Japanese designer Kazuo Kawasaki, has reportedly run  out of supplies after orders soared and has increased imports.      Shoe company Naughty Monkey has seen a similar rush for the  open-toed red shoes that Palin wore on the day she was  introduced as McCain's running mate -- and wig sellers are out  in force.      'Hair stylists across the country are being barraged by  clientele for the 'Palin Up-do' (with) women putting politics  aside to admire an elegant hairstyle,' said a spokeswoman for  Paula Young, a Massachusetts retailer of hairpieces and wigs.

        "Text": "    By Steve Holland      WASHINGTON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Love her or hate her, Sarah  Palin was a phenomenon as the Republican vice presidential  running mate to John McCain, and the question for the  self-styled moose-hunting hockey mom is: What now?      Alaska Gov. Palin, plucked from obscurity and thrust on to  the national stage to mixed reviews, was publicly cool to talk  that she might have caught the presidential bug and seek to run  against Democrat Barack Obama in 2012.      'I don't know politically where in the world I'll be then,'  she told reporters on Wednesday in Phoenix.      But her interest in playing some kind of national role was  evident from the words of McCain himself on Tuesday night in  his concession speech after he was defeated by Obama.      'We can all look forward with great interest to her future  service to Alaska, the Republican Party and our country,' he  said.      Palin, 44, drew huge crowds on the campaign trail, bigger  than McCain's. She proved to be a powerful performer in stump  speeches, energizing the Republican base.      But she was less effective in television interviews,  botching a couple of early media encounters to the point that  some prominent conservatives said she was too inexperienced to  be a heartbeat away from the presidency.      Her folksy, 'you betcha' style was both refreshing and  grist for countless jokes on late-night television, giving a  career boost to her actress doppelganger, Tina Fey of NBC's  'Saturday Night Live.'      'She clearly has a future in national politics,' said  Republican strategist Scott Reed. 'She has to work to rebuild  the parts of her image that became a caricature. But she's  extremely popular with the grassroots.'      'Palin needs to take some time back in Alaska and regroup  with her day job. There's plenty of time to plot and scheme  after the Christmas holidays,' he said.           REPUBLICAN VISIONS      While Palin was selected by McCain in 2008, if she ran in  2012 she would compete against formidable members of her own  party with their own visions like former Massachusetts Gov.  Mitt Romney, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Louisiana  Gov. Bobby Jindal.      Republican strategist Tony Fabrizio said Palin is not the  frontrunner for the Republican nomination in 2012. He noted in  particular some revelations uncovered by the news media during  what amounted to a public vetting of her record once she was  picked by McCain.      Her acceptance of thousands of dollars in daily travel  expenses from the state while living at home and the Republican  Party's costly shopping spree to equip her and her family with  designer clothing may come back to haunt her.      'She needs to go back home and face all of the stuff that's  been raked up in the presidential race. Voters in Alaska found  out a lot of stuff about Sarah Palin that they didn't know  about Sarah Palin. She's got to go back and get herself  re-elected,' Fabrizio said.      Palin's future may depend on how the Republican Party  itself changes in response to its defeat.      Social conservatives who are warmest to Palin represent a  dwindling minority in the party, which was rocked by the Obama  victory and will now undergo a period of reflection and  soul-searching about the future.      Palin was said to have little time for people who did not  agree with her socially conservative views.      'If she wants to be a voice for a part of the new failed  Republican Party, she's going",

        "Text": "    By Sue Zeidler      LOS ANGELES, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Sarah Palin represents  many things Hollywood liberals love to hate, from her  opposition to gay marriage to her support for gun rights, yet  she possesses two key qualities they admire -- star appeal and  a great script.      Accordingly, Hollywood Republicans -- often overshadowed by  their left-leaning peers -- are seeking to capitalize on the  celebrity of John McCain's running mate in the Nov. 4 election  to generate support in a town well-known for its lavish  Democratic fund-raisers and events.      'She's certainly got star appeal and is the kind of  candidate that is made for Hollywood. I offered to throw her a  fundraiser myself,' said MGM chief Harry Sloan, one of  Hollywood's most vocal Republicans.      Palin has shaken up the White House race, boosted  enthusiasm among previously apathetic supporters of McCain's  presidential nomination and drawn support from women, rural  voters and Southerners, according to recent polls.      Sloan said there were no plans for a Palin Hollywood  fundraiser yet as her campaign managers were inundated with  similar requests from all over the country after her national  debut at the Republican National Convention on Sept. 3.      A campaign spokesman would not disclose McCain and Palin's  movements beyond one week's time, but various Hollywood  executives said they heard the Arizona senator and Alaska  governor would be swinging through California later this month  or early next month.      Democratic candidates have long enjoyed a fundraising  advantage in Hollywood. Through the end of July, Democratic  presidential nominee Barack Obama raised $5.2 million from the  entertainment industry, compared with McCain's $885,000,  according to the Center for Responsive Politics.      'It's like 10 to 1 here in terms of performing artists who  support Obama versus McCain. There are a significant group of  Republican supporters in Hollywood, but they're just not as  outspoken,' said political analyst Allan Hoffenblum.        PERSONAL STORY      Hollywood is aligning again for Obama on Sept. 16 when  Barbra Streisand will sing at a Beverly Hills event expected to  raise as much as $9 million.      While some Hollywood political watchers see Palin helping  to mobilize greater celebrity support around Obama, they said  filmmakers, producers and other entertainment executives were  fascinated by the personal story of McCain's running mate,  including her 'hockey mom' persona and passion for hunting.      'These people are interested in drama, and Sarah Palin, a  pistol-packing mother of five, is clearly an interesting  character. Politically, they may not agree with Sarah Palin but  they are intrigued,' said Joel Fox, a political analyst.      Long-time Democrat Dan Glickman, chairman of the Motion  Picture Association of America, attended the Republican  National Convention. 'It's important to show our organization  has allies in both camps. Our issues are bi-partisan,' said  Glickman.      'The question is does she become a bigger draw than McCain?  It's too early to draw any conclusions,' he said.      Palin's arrival is encouraging to Hollywood conservatives  like Robert Davi, who stars in director David Zucker's upcoming  'An American Carol,' a spoof about a liberal filmmaker who  wanted to abolish the July 4 Independence Day holiday.      'A lot of times, conservative guys on the set feel  intimidated and unable to speak their view,' said Da",

        "Text": "    Oct 2 (Reuters) - Republican vice presidential candidate  Sarah Palin debates her Democratic rival, Joe Biden, on  Thursday in their only face-off before the Nov. 4 presidential  election.      Following are some biographical details for Palin, a  little-known Alaska governor before she was chosen as John  McCain's running mate:           Age: 44      Birth date: Feb. 11, 1964      Birthplace: Sandpoint, Idaho      Education: University of Idaho      Husband: Todd Palin      Children: Two sons and three daughters      Religious affiliation: Has attended nondenominational  Wasilla Bible Church in recent years; previously attended  Wasilla Assembly of God, a Pentecostal church           Family: Palin moved to Alaska with her parents, a teacher  and school secretary, when she was an infant. She grew up in  Wasilla, a town of nearly 10,000 near Anchorage.      Palin was a member of the state champion girls basketball  team, where she earned the nickname 'Sarah Barracuda' for her  aggressive play. She was crowned Miss Wasilla in a 1982 beauty  pageant and later competed in the Miss Alaska contest.      Palin graduated in 1987 from the University of Idaho with a  degree in journalism and political science and eloped with her  high school boyfriend in 1988 to avoid the cost of a wedding.      The couple have five children -- two sons and three  daughters. The eldest son, Track, deployed to Iraq with the  U.S. Army in September. The youngest, son Trig, was born in  April with Down syndrome.           Career: After her graduation and marriage, Palin worked as  a television sports reporter from 1987 to 1989. She also worked  in the family's commercial fishing business and was the owner  of a snowmobile, watercraft and all-terrain vehicle business.           Elective office/public service: Palin was elected to the  Wasilla City Council in 1992. She served two terms on the  council and was elected mayor for two terms. She gained the  attention of Republican Party officials by promoting growth and  cutting property taxes.      Palin ran for lieutenant governor in 2002 but lost. After  actively campaigning for the Republican ticket under Frank  Murkowski, she was appointed to the panel that regulates the  state's oil and gas industry.      Palin established herself as a party outsider by promoting  a pipeline project opposed by Murkowski. She ran against the  governor in 2006, defeated him in the primary and then defeated  a former Democratic governor in the general election.      As governor she has worked on ethics reform, sought to  reduce state spending and promoted a deal that would offer $500  million in seed money for the construction of a natural gas  pipeline.      She ignited a controversy by firing the state's respected  top police officer. He charged he was dismissed for resisting  pressure from the governor's office to lay off a state trooper  who was involved in a bitter divorce and custody dispute with  Palin's sister. The state Legislature is investigating the  incident.

        "Text": "    Sept 1 (Reuters) - Here are some facts about Republican  vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and how her selection  could affect the ticket headed by Sen. John McCain.      * Palin was sworn in as Alaska's youngest and first woman  governor in December 2006. Born in Sandpoint, Idaho, Feb. 11,  1964, she moved to Alaska with her parents as an infant.      * Palin is a darling of U.S. conservatives because of her  record on tax cuts, opposition to abortion and other issues.

        "Text": "    Nov 4 (Reuters) - Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is the first  woman to run on a Republican presidential ticket.      Following are some biographical details about Palin, who  was little known nationally before she was chosen as John  McCain's vice presidential running mate:           Age: 44      Birth date: Feb. 11, 1964      Birthplace: Sandpoint, Idaho      Education: University of Idaho      Husband: Todd Palin      Children: Two sons and three daughters      Religious affiliation: Christian who has attended  nondenominational Wasilla Bible Church in recent years;  previously attended Wasilla Assembly of God, a Pentecostal  church.      Family: Palin moved to Alaska with her parents, a teacher  and school secretary, when she was an infant. She grew up in  Wasilla, a small town near Anchorage.      Palin was a member of the state champion girls basketball  team, on which she was nicknamed 'Sarah Barracuda' for her  aggressive play. She was crowned Miss Wasilla in a 1982 beauty  pageant and later competed in the Miss Alaska contest.      Palin graduated in 1987 from the University of Idaho with a  degree in journalism and political science and eloped with her  high school boyfriend in 1988 to avoid the cost of a wedding.      The couple have five children -- two sons and three  daughters. The eldest son, Track, deployed to Iraq with the  U.S. Army in September. The youngest, son Trig, was born in  April with Down syndrome.        Career: After her graduation and marriage, Palin worked as  a television sports reporter from 1987 to 1989. She also worked  in the family's commercial fishing business and was the owner  of a snowmobile, watercraft and all-terrain vehicle business.           Elective office/public service: Palin was elected to the  Wasilla City Council in 1992. She served two terms on the  council and was elected mayor for two terms. She gained the  attention of Republican Party officials by promoting growth and  cutting property taxes.      Palin ran for lieutenant governor in 2002 but lost. After  campaigning for the Republican ticket under Frank Murkowski,  she was appointed to the panel that regulates Alaska's oil and  gas industry.      Palin established herself as a party outsider by promoting  a pipeline project opposed by Murkowski. She ran against the  governor in 2006, defeated him in the primary and then defeated  a former Democratic governor in the general election.      As governor, she has worked on ethics reform, sought to  reduce state spending and promoted a deal that would offer $500  million in seed money for constructing a natural gas pipeline.      She ignited controversy by firing the state's respected top  police officer. He charged he was dismissed for resisting  pressure from Palin's office to lay off a state trooper  involved in a bitter divorce and custody dispute with her  sister. A state legislative inquiry concluded in October that  Palin had abused her power by pressuring subordinates to fire  the trooper. The Alaska Personnel Board on Monday cleared her  of wrongdoing in the matter.

        "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin  suggested in an interview broadcast on Monday that she might  run for higher office in 2012 if the right opportunity presents  itself.      Even before the Republican loss in last Tuesday's election  in which Palin was the running mate of Republican presidential  candidate John McCain, there was talk of the 44-year-old  first-term Alaska governor running for president in 2012.      'Show me where the open door is. Even if it's cracked up a  little bit, maybe I'll plow right on through that and maybe  prematurely plow through it, but don't let me miss an open  door,' Palin said in an interview on Fox News' 'On The Record'  program. She did not specify which office she might be  interested in seeking.      Palin, whose term as governor ends in two years,  said she  could not predict the future. But she said it would be 'very  exciting' to have an opportunity to serve in a greater  capacity.      'If there is an open door in '12 or four years later, and  if it is something that is going to be good for my family, for  my state, for my nation, an opportunity for me, then I'll plow  through that door,' Palin said.      As McCain's surprise pick in a hard-fought campaign against  Democrat Barack Obama, Palin attracted controversy but also a  strong following in the Republican Party's conservative base.

        "Text": "    Sept 3 (Reuters) - Here are some facts about Sarah Palin,  who rose quickly from small-town mayor to one of the most  popular governors in Alaskan history before her surprise  selection as Republican John McCain's vice presidential running  mate.      * Born in Sandpoint, Idaho, on Feb. 11, 1964, she moved to  Alaska with her parents as an infant. As a star on the state  champion Wasilla High School girls' basketball team, she was  known as 'Sarah Barracuda' for her aggressive play. She  graduated in 1987 from the University of Idaho, where she  studied journalism. She worked as a sports reporter at an  Anchorage television station in 1988.      * She entered politics in 1992 by running for the city  council in Wasilla, a town outside Anchorage that then had  about 5,000 residents. She was re-elected to a second term in  1995, and became Wasilla's mayor in 1996.      * She gained statewide fame as a whistle-blower calling  attention to ethical violations by high-ranking Republican  officials in Alaska, including the chairman of the state  Republican party and was sworn in as the state's youngest and  first woman governor in December 2006.      * As governor, Palin has spoken out against corruption,  battled for funding from major oil producers and convinced the  legislature to give a $1,200 'energy rebate' to nearly every  Alaskan. Her approval rating in the state stands at 80  percent.      * Palin is under investigation by Alaska's state  legislature to determine whether she fired a public safety  commissioner after he declined to fire a state trooper who had  divorced Palin's sister. Palin has hired a private lawyer in  the probe.     * Palin married her high school sweetheart, Todd Palin, in  1988. A champion snowmachine racer, Todd Palin is a commercial  fisherman who has worked for BP and has been a production  operator in oil fields on Alaska's North Slope.     * Palin, who has five children including a son born in April  with Down Syndrome and an unmarried 17-year-old who is  pregnant, is favored by social conservatives because of her  opposition to abortion, devout Christianity and lifetime  membership in the National Rifle Association.     * In 1984, Palin won the Miss Wasilla pageant, and finished  second in the Miss Alaska pageant, at which she was named 'Miss  Congeniality.

        "Text": "    By Jill Serjeant      LOS ANGELES, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Sarah Palin steps into the  lion's den of political satire on Saturday with an appearance on  the comedy show that has mocked the Republican vice-presidential  candidate and helped shape the national debate.      Palin's appearance on 'Saturday Night Live' follows a series  of dead-on impersonations of her by comedian Tina Fey that have  sent ratings for the show soaring and become as talked about as  the Alaska governor and self-described hockey mom herself.      Actor Josh Brolin, who captures the Texas swagger and twang  of President George W. Bush in the new Oliver Stone biopic  'W.', is expected to join Palin on Saturday's show, just 17 days  before the Nov. 4 election.      'I just want to be there to show Americans that we will  rise above the political shots that we take because we're in  this serious business for serious challenges that are facing  the good American people right now,' Palin told Neal Boortz,  talking about the forthcoming SNL appearance on his syndicated  radio show on Friday.      It was not clear whether Fey, the Emmy-award winning star  of the TV show '30 Rock' and the movie 'Baby Mama', will  reprise her own turn as Palin. Fey's three skits have boosted  'Saturday Night Live' ratings by 50 percent in the past month  and attracted more than 38 million viewings live or online.      Fey's impersonations have included an 'I can see Russia from  my house' joke skewering what critics see as Palin's lack of  foreign policy knowledge, and a flute-toting bid for a 'talent  portion' during the vice presidential debate that played on  critics' charges that Palin, a one-time beauty pageant contestant,  is too shallow for the vice presidency.      The skits have capped a political season in which comedy has  played an influential role.      Palin was a surprise pick by Republican presidential candidate  John McCain in August as his running mate, and has been a big hit  with conservative Christians who admire her no-nonsense, folksy  style. But the choice has been derided by supporters of Democratic  candidate Barack Obama, thanks in part to the Fey skits.      'I would expect that the McCain campaign would be much happier  if Tina Fey wasn't so popular with her impersonation of Sarah  Palin,' Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at the  University of Southern California, told Reuters.      'It does shape the public perception of Sarah Palin,' Jeffe  said.      Democrats Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden have also been  lampooned on SNL, and both Obama and McCain have appeared on the  show during the long presidential campaign.           GOING WHERE OTHERS DON'T TREAD      Satirical news shows like 'The Colbert Report' and Jon  Stewart's 'The Daily Show' along with jokes by late night chat  show hosts David Letterman and Jay Leno have gone where  straight news reporting has often feared to tread, according to  Robert Thompson, professor of media and popular culture at  Syracuse University.      'We are in a period now that journalists are afraid of  being accused of picking on people. Comedy is not only  influential but lately it has become an important part of the  U.S. civic conversation,' Thompson said.      'What Jon Stewart and Tina Fey are doing is not only  hysterically funny, but they really have used comedy to make us  ask questions about the things we should be thinking about.'      Thompson said Fey's skit of Palin's rambling television  intervi",

        "Text": "    Aug 29, (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John  McCain has chosen Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice  presidential running mate, a campaign official said on Friday.      The choice of the 44-year-old mother of five adds youth and  executive experience to the Republican ticket headed by the  72-year-old Arizona senator, who would be the oldest person to  assume the presidency if he is elected Nov. 4.      The choice of Palin adds a woman and a strong pro-life  voice to the Republican campaign, but her youth, limited  governmental experience and lack of exposure nationally could  be weaknesses for the ticket.      Following are some facts and figures about Palin:      * Palin was sworn in as Alaska's youngest and first woman  governor in December 2006. Born in Sandpoint, Idaho, Feb. 11,  1964, she moved to Alaska with her parents as an infant.      * Palin is a darling of U.S. conservatives because of  record on tax cuts, opposition to abortion and other issues.  Her place on the ticket may help shore up McCain with the  Republican Party's Christian base.      * Before her election as governor two years ago, she served  on the Wasilla City Council and as mayor of the town. She was  later appointed to the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation  Commission, where she learned about the state's energy  industry.      * Like McCain she has a maverick streak. She has taken on  big oil companies in Alaska and has broken ranks with the local  Republican establishment.      * 'The oil companies have been hugely influential in  Alaska, certainly over the last decade and a half with the  prior two administrations ... (For) Alaskans, as owners of the  resource ... it is time to embrace our sovereignty,' she told  Reuters in an interview a few months ago.      * Palin is a devout Christian who is opposed to abortion  rights. She is also an avid hunter and angler and a member of  the National Rifle Association, a powerful conservative lobby  that is staunchly opposed to gun control.      * She has irked environmentalists by opposing the listing  of the polar bear as a threatened species and is a big  supporter of oil and gas drilling off the Alaska coast.      * Palin, who grew up in Wasilla, near Anchorage, studied  journalism and political science at the University of Idaho.  She worked in a commercial fishing business with her husband  and as a television sportscaster before entering politics.      * Palin gave birth to her fifth child, a son, in April,  becoming the second U.S. governor to have a baby while serving  in office.

        "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Dec 30 (Reuters) - If they had to live next  door to a celebrity, American adults would most like to be  neighbors with Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and chat show host Oprah  Winfrey.      But trouble-prone pop star Britney Spears would be the  worst celebrity neighbor, according to a survey published on   Tuesday of the most and least desirable well-known faces  Americans would have in their backyard.      Republican vice presidential candidate Palin topped the  poll of most desirable celebrity neighbors with 14 percent,  closely followed by Winfrey, who was particularly popular with  women.      Olympic champion swimmer Michael Phelps was heavily favored  by men but came in third with 9 percent overall.      Paparazzi-magnets such as Spears, actress Lindsay Lohan and  British couple David and Victoria Beckham apparently don't make  the best neighbors.      Spears, who was followed day and night by packs of  photographers for much of 2008, was voted the least desirable  neighbor by 19 percent of adults, followed by Rosie O'Donnell  (18 percent), Joe the Plumber (8 percent), who made headlines  in the final stages of the U.S. presidential elections, and  Lohan (7 percent).      Only two per cent of those asked wanted to live next door  to soccer player Beckham and his singer wife Victoria.      The poll was commissioned by real estate Web site  Zillow.com between Dec 15-17 with 2,196 Americans aged over  18.

        "Text": "     Sept 3 (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John  McCain's newly chosen running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin,  created an immediate stir with news that she is the subject of  a state ethics probe and her unmarried teenage daughter is  pregnant.      Palin will accept the nomination on Wednesday in a speech  to the Republican convention. Here are some potential scenarios  for her candidacy and its impact on the Nov. 4 presidential  election against Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama  and his No. 2, Joe Biden.      - The choice of Palin, 44, a conservative abortion rights  opponent with a record of bucking the Republican establishment  in Alaska, has rallied the conservative base to McCain, who has  struggled to win over that crucial constituency.      Her speech will give the party a chance to answer questions  about her familiarity with domestic and foreign policy issues,  and possibly address the issue of her 17-year-old daughter's  pregnancy and the investigation into whether she abused her  power in having a public safety commissioner fired in Alaska.      'She'll be greeted rapturously because the delegates are  very conservative, as is she,' University of Virginia political  analyst Larry Sabato said of her convention appearance. 'She's  become their heroine. But what the delegates think and what the  country thinks are probably two different things.'      - The selection of the political unknown has raised  questions about McCain's judgment and the degree to which his  campaign investigated Palin's background. That is a distraction  that could hurt the campaign's efforts to generate momentum for  the election battle with Obama.      'My vetting process was completely thorough and I'm  grateful for the results,' McCain told reporters in  Philadelphia.      - Palin's slot on the ticket is secure, but new revelations  or scandals from Alaska could threaten her standing. It would  take a lot, however, to dump her two months before the  election.      'If he drops her, the election is over. There's zero chance  that he'll drop her,' Sabato said.

        "Text": "    By Andrea Hopkins      CINCINNATI, Sept 2 (Reuters) - In America, where teenage  pregnancy is a political issue and working moms subject to  moral debate, the choice of Sarah Palin as the Republican  vice-presidential pick has ignited a Mommy War.      Questions about Palin's qualifications were raised almost  as soon as presidential candidate John McCain shocked the  political world by picking the relatively unknown Alaska  governor to be his running mate last week.      The emergence of personal details has fueled the debate.      News that Palin, a conservative Christian, is running for the  country's No. 2 office while parenting both an infant son with  Down Syndrome and a 17-year-old pregnant daughter has sparked both  condemnation and commendation.      Should a 44-year-old mother of five, including a newborn  with special needs and a pregnant teenager, take on a job that  will keep her away from her home for much of the next two months  to eight years?      Nearly two-thirds of American mothers with preschool-aged  children were in the labor force in 2003, according to the  latest government figures. Women rich and poor, famous or not,  grapple with the same issues and public perceptions.      The Republican Party's conservative base, having worked to  co-opt moral issues for their political cause, so far has  rallied around Palin and her daughter despite its promotion of  abstinence education and traditional families.      The daughter will have the child and marry the father.      'I can't get past the part of the scripture that says it is  the responsibility of the parents to raise the child. But I do  believe that some parents can raise their children well and not  stay home all the time,' said Lindsay Matlock, an anti-abortion  volunteer at this week's Republican convention in Minnesota.      'My only reservation would be that her son has Down  Syndrome and ... her being away so much,' said Matlock, 21.      Dr. Bill Maier, vice president and psychologist in  residence for the conservative Christian group Focus on the  Family, came to the candidate's defense, saying: 'Gov. Palin  seems to have been able to maintain a balance between work and  family.'           SEXISM?      The very fact that Americans are debating whether a woman  with a new baby should be in a demanding job galls Carol Evans,  president and chief executive of Working Mother Media, which  publishes Working Mother magazine.      'The fact that the United States is the only developed  country without paid maternity leave should be front and  center, not whether (Palin) can go back to work with a  four-month old,' said Evans, noting that the average American  working mother returns to work 11 weeks after giving birth.      A question that emerges for Americans of all political  stripes is: Would any of this be asked if Palin was a man?      'If we say a woman can't have a career when her children  are babies, we are discriminating based on gender,' said  Democrat Barbara Matousek, a 41-year-old Wisconsin engineer and  working mother of an 8-month-old.      She was concerned, however, about Palin's other child.      'The thing I have trouble reconciling is how any parent,  male or female, could agree to take on this very public  position at a time when their child is so fragile,' she said.  'Being a pregnant, unmarried, 17-year-old high school student  would be hard enough without the entire world watching.'      Some voters saw authenticity in Palin's life",

        "Text": "    By Dan Whitcomb      LOS ANGELES, Oct 27 (Reuters) - An effigy of U.S.  Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin hanging by a  noose as part of a Halloween display drew complaints on Monday,  but local officials said the homeowner was covered by free  speech rights.      A mannequin dressed to resemble the Alaska governor, with  her trademark beehive hairdo and glasses, was hung by the neck  from the eaves of the home in famously liberal West Hollywood.      On the roof, a mannequin of Republican presidential  candidate John McCain, protruded from the chimney surrounded in  flames, holding his head as he was apparently burned alive.      'We have been getting some phone calls this morning  complaining about it but if (the homeowner) isn't in violation  of municipal code we have no reason to cite them,' West  Hollywood spokeswoman Helen Goss said.      'People have First Amendment rights (to free speech),' Goss  said. 'I would speculate that if it's part of a Halloween  display then its political satire.'      Homeowner Chad Michael Morisette told local KCAL-TV the  display should be considered Halloween 'art' and said his  neighbors would probably be more offended by a similar scene  invoking Democrat Barack Obama.      'I know if we had done Barack Obama, people would have  probably thrown things through our windows,' Morisette said.  'The image of a hanged black man is a lot more intense than the  image of a hanged white woman for our country, the history of  our country.'      Earlier a cardboard likeness of Obama was strung up from a  tree at an Oregon university and an Ohio man who told local  media he didn't want to see an African-American running the  country hung a ghostly figure bearing an Obama sign from a tree  in his yard.      If he wins the Nov. 4 election, Obama will be the first  African American to become U.S. president.      West Hollywood is known for its large gay population and  its liberal politics. It hosts a large and flamboyant outdoor  Halloween parade each year.      Palin, who is seen as more conservative than running-mate  McCain, has been a lightning-rod of criticism from the left  since her nomination to the ticket.

        "Text": " (Adds dropped word in 2nd paragraph)      Sept 2 (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John  McCain's newly chosen running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin,  created an immediate stir with news that she is the subject of  a state ethics probe and her unmarried teenage daughter is  pregnant.      Palin will accept the nomination on Wednesday in a speech  to the Republican convention. Here are some potential scenarios  for her candidacy and its impact on the Nov. 4 presidential  election against Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama  and his No. 2, Joe Biden.      - The choice of Palin, 44, a conservative abortion rights  opponent with a record of bucking the Republican establishment  in Alaska, has rallied the conservative base to McCain, who has  struggled to win over that crucial constituency.      Her speech will give the party a chance to answer questions  about her familiarity with domestic and foreign policy issues,  and possibly address the issue of her 17-year-old daughter's  pregnancy and the investigation into whether she abused her  power in having a public safety commissioner fired in Alaska.      'She'll be greeted rapturously because the delegates are  very conservative, as is she,' University of Virginia political  analyst Larry Sabato said of her convention appearance. 'She's  become their heroine. But what the delegates think and what the  country thinks are probably two different things.'      - The selection of the political unknown has raised  questions about McCain's judgment and the degree to which his  campaign investigated Palin's background. That is a distraction  that could hurt the campaign's efforts to generate momentum for  the election battle with Obama.      'My vetting process was completely thorough and I'm  grateful for the results,' McCain told reporters in  Philadelphia.      - Palin's slot on the ticket is secure, but new revelations  or scandals from Alaska could threaten her standing. It would  take a lot, however, to dump her two months before the  election.      'If he drops her, the election is over. There's zero chance  that he'll drop her,' Sabato said.

Sarah Palin as his  running mate on Friday, adding a political unknown to the  presidential ticket who could help him appeal to women voters.      Palin, 44, a self-described 'hockey mom,' is a conservative  first-term governor of Alaska with strong anti-abortion views,  a record of reform and fiscal conservatism and an outsider's  perspective on Washington.      'She's exactly who I need. She's exactly who this country  needs to help me fight the same old Washington politics of me  first and country second,' McCain told a roaring crowd of  15,000 supporters in Dayton, Ohio.      Palin was chosen over more experienced and better known  contenders as the Arizona senator grabbed the spotlight away  from Democratic rival Barack Obama one day after Obama accepted  his party's presidential nomination before 75,000 flag-waving  supporters at Denver's football stadium.      'Senator, I am honored to be chosen as your running mate. I  will be honored to serve next to the next president of the  United States,' Palin said, joined on stage by her husband and  family.

The pick followed days of speculation about McCain's  choice, with most of the better-known contenders like former  Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty  eliminated over the last 24 hours.      Palin, former mayor of the town of Wasilla, is virtually  unknown nationally.

'But it turns  out the women of America aren't finished yet, and we can  shatter that glass ceiling once and for all.'           RISKY CHOICE?      The choice of Palin was a risk for McCain given her lack of  national experience, but her record in Alaska will help him  reinforce his reform message. Palin built a reputation as a  reformer in a state that recently has been hit with corruption  scandals.      Elected in 2006, she is Alaska's first woman governor. She  is also an avid sportswoman who would bring youth and vitality  to the ticket. McCain turns 72 on Friday and would be the  oldest person to take office for a first term in the White  House if elected.      'Today, John McCain put the former mayor of a town of 9,000  with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the  presidency,' said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton, who  said she would work to overturn abortion rights and continue  Republican economic policies.

Sarah Palin as his  running mate on Friday, adding a political unknown to the  presidential ticket who could help him appeal to women voters.      Palin, 44, a self-described 'hockey mom,' is a conservative  first-term governor of Alaska with strong anti-abortion views,  a record of reform and fiscal conservatism and an outsider's  perspective on Washington.      'She's exactly who I need. She's exactly who this country  needs to help me fight the same old Washington politics of me  first and country second,' McCain told a roaring crowd of  15,000 supporters in Dayton, Ohio.      Palin was chosen over more experienced and better known  contenders as the Arizona senator grabbed the spotlight away  from Democratic rival Barack Obama one day after Obama accepted  his party's presidential nomination before 75,000 flag-waving  supporters at Denver's football stadium.      'The mission is clear. The next 67 days, I'm going to take  our campaign to every part of our country and our message of  reform to every voter of every background in every political  party or no party at all,' said Palin, joined on stage by her  husband and family. She has five children ranging in age from 5  months to 18 years.      'As governor, I've stood up to the old politics as usual,'  she said. 'This is a moment when principle and political  independence matter a lot more than just party lines.'      McCain and Palin will face Obama and his No. 2, Joe Biden,  in the Nov. 4 presidential election, with polls showing them  running neck-and-neck.      The pick followed days of speculation about McCain's  choice, with most of the better-known contenders like former  Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty  eliminated over the last 24 hours.           '18 MILLION CRACKS'      Palin, the former mayor of the town of Wasilla, is  virtually unknown and untested nationally. That could hurt  McCain's argument that Obama, 47, a first-term senator from  Illinois, is too inexperienced to handle the White House.      But she could help him appeal to disaffected supporters of  Democrat Hillary Clinton, who lost a bruising primary to Obama.  Palin noted the achievements of Clinton and Democrat Geraldine  Ferraro, who in 1984 became the first woman vice presidential  nominee of a major party.      'Hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest, hardest  glass ceiling in America,' she said, referring to the 18  million votes Clinton received in the primaries. 'But it turns  out the women of America aren't finished yet, and we can  shatter that glass ceiling once and for all.'      Palin would be the first woman U.S. vice president, adding  another historic element to a presidential race that has been  filled with firsts. Obama, 47, is the first black nominee of a  major U.S. political party.      Her record in Alaska will help McCain reinforce his reform  message. Palin built a reputation as a reformer in a state that  recently has been hit with corruption scandals.      Elected in 2006, she is Alaska's first woman governor. She  is also an avid sportswoman who would bring youth and vitality  to the ticket. McCain turns 72 on Friday and would be the  oldest person to take office for a first term in the White  House ",
