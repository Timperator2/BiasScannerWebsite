      "Text": "    DETROIT, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The wages and benefits for the  United Auto Workers union are at the center of a debate on a  $14 billion package in emergency loans to U.S. automakers.      Some Republican senators want Detroit autoworkers to have  pay parity with foreign auto manufacturers.      But the UAW has said the wages and benefits of its members  are now competitive with workers employed by Japanese  automakers following landmark labor agreements the union  reached with General Motors Corp <GM.N>, Chrysler and Ford  Motor Co <F.N> in 2007.      The agreement slashed wages for new hires and created a  trust for retiree healthcare called a Voluntary Employee  Beneficiary Association, or VEBA, to shift liabilities to a  union-aligned trust to be established in 2010.      Here are details of the average hourly labor cost of UAW  workers employed at Ford and those employed by non-U.S. based  automakers with plants in the United States. The figures are  similar across the three Detroit automakers.           WAGES: Base wages and cost of living adjustments      UAW: $29      Transplants: $26           WAGE RELATED: Paid vacation, overtime, holidays, night and  weekend pay, break time      UAW: $14      Transplants: $9           BENEFITS: Healthcare, training, etc      UAW: $12      Transplants: $11           LEGACY COSTS (Without VEBA): Pension and healthcare  benefits for retirees      UAW: $16      Transplants: $3           LEGACY COSTS (With VEBA): Pension and healthcare benefits  for retirees      UAW: $3      Transplants: $3      TOTAL LABOR COST:      UAW (without VEBA): $71      UAW (with VEBA): $58      Transplants: $49           Source: Ford.      Note: Average wage assumes 20 percent entry-level  employees.

      "Text": "The United Auto Workers may be out of the hole now that President Bush has approved a $17 billion bailout of the U.S. auto industry, but the union isn't out of the bunker just yet.\n\nEven as the industry struggles with massive losses, the UAW brass continue to own and operate a $33 million lakeside retreat in Michigan, complete with a $6.4 million designer golf course. And it's costing them millions each year.\n\n\u2022 Click here to see photos of the UAW's $33 million retreat.\n\nThe UAW, known more for its strikes than its slices, hosts seminars and junkets at the Walter and May Reuther Family Education Center in Onaway, Mich., which is nestled on \"1,000 heavily forested acres\" on Michigan's Black Lake, according to its Web site.\n\nBut the Black Lake club and retreat, which are among the union's biggest fixed assets, have lost $23 million in the past five years alone, a heavy albatross around the union's neck as it tries to manage a multibillion-dollar pension plan crisis.\n\nCritics call it a resort for union leaders that wastes money from union dues.\n\n\"It's their members' money that they're spending on this thing,\" said Justin Wilson, managing director of the Center for Union Facts, a union watchdog group. \"The union has bigger issues at hand than managing a golf course.\"\n\nManaging the course may become a burden for the union. The UAW covers costs for the Reuther Center from the interest it earns on its strike fund, according to tax documents, but massive losses in the past five years have forced the union to make heavy loans to keep the center afloat. Critics call it a poor investment for a group with over $1.25 billion in assets.\n\n\"Unions certainly have had real estate investments in the past, but investments are supposed to make money, not bleed money,\" said Wilson.\n\nThe UAW did not return calls from FOXNews.com, and a spokesman could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe Reuther Center is open 11 months of the year to offer courses on leadership, political action, civil rights and other topics; it hosts nearly 10,000 visitors annually. The UAW says it sends workers there to \"learn, experience unionism (and) commit to labor's cause,\" according to their Web site.\n\nThe center was purchased in 1967 and underwent massive renovations in the '90s under the careful watch of former UAW president Steve Yokich. \"Today's Black Lake might not exist if not for Steve Yokich,\" said union member Bob Reidt, whom Yokich appointed as Black Lake's director. \"Yokich is responsible for rebuilding Black Lake.\"\n\nThe UAW erected a monument to its longtime president Walter Reuther \u2014 the center's namesake \u2014 which bears an inscription of his words: \"There is no greater calling than to serve your brother. There is no greater satisfaction than to have done it well.\"\n\nBut Reuther, who died in a plane crash en route to the center in 1970, never knew the satisfaction of Black Lake's \"well-groomed fairways,\" a course that Michigan Golf Magazine called a \"stunning visual marvel.\"\n\nUnion members can play golf at discounted rates on one of the country's top 100 courses, designed in 2000 by famed course architect Rees Jones at a cost of $6 million.\n\nThe center has a storied history. Reuther had his ashes scattered at the site, and Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz honeymooned there in 1940, well before it was bought by the UAW.\n\n\"It's funny that they call it an education center \u2014 it's a resort,\" said Wilson. \"If I was a union member, I would prefer that they rented out a room at the Ramada Inn.\"",

      "Text": " (For other news from the Reuters Autos Summit, click on  http://www.reuters.com/summit/Autos08?pid=500)      DETROIT, Sept 16 (Reuters) - United Auto Workers President  Ron Gettelfinger said on Tuesday that the union will work hard  for the election of Democrat Barack Obama for U.S. president  and push for passage of a key union organizing law.      'I know, based on the number of members that we have  registered, based on our polling ourselves, input that we get,  we're going to come in with a very, very high margin behind our  endorsed candidate,' Gettelfinger told reporters at the Reuters  Auto Summit when asked about the UAW's backing of Obama.      'I don't look for us to be any different than what we have  been. We're very effective, we have a very effective political  action program. We're ready to go,' Gettelfinger said.      Michigan is a key swing state in the U.S. November  election, with polls showing Obama and Republican John McCain  in a tight race despite thousands of job losses in the  struggling U.S. auto industry.      Gettelfinger said the UAW and other unions were working to  focus the election on issues like job, pension and benefit  losses among blue color workers, a struggling U.S. middle  class, rising home foreclosures, soaring energy and health  costs, rising government debt and soaring trade deficits.      'It appears to me that the Republicans are running a  campaign based on distraction and they don't want to talk about  the issues because they can't talk about the issues,' he said.      The market share of U.S. vehicle sales by U.S. automakers  dipped below 50 percent in 2007 for the first time on record.  UAW membership at the end of the year fell to 464,910, down 14  percent in the year and the lowest level since 1941.      Gettelfinger said passage of the Employee Free Choice Act  (EFCA) remained a key objective for the UAW going forward.  Blocked in Congress for years, EFCA legislation would let  workers organize by signing union authorization cards; set a  time line for first contracts between unions and employees; and  impose higher fines for violating employees' rights to  organize.      UAW organizing of U.S. plants owned by foreign automakers  has been hampered by companies seeking to intimidate workers,  Gettlefinger said.      'The way organizing works today would be like you running  for governor of the state of Michigan. The only thing is you  can't come into Michigan, and you couldn't campaign inside  Michigan. And your opponent would be inside Michigan and  running all day long,' Gettlefinger said.      'They intimidate workers, they fire workers. If I come in  here right now and you were running an organizing drive and I  just walked over to you and said, 'You're fired,' that's going  to resonate throughout the building.'      Corporate critics claim union backing of the EFCA amounts  to denial of workers' rights to a secret vote on whether to  join a union. But Gettelfinger said UAW support of EFCA was the  same as with its support of any organized political vote.      'We don't tell anybody how to vote. One thing we don't do  is we don't want to get in the voting booth with anybody. But  what we do want to do is make sure that people are informed  when they go in and cast their vote,' Gettelfinger said.      He said the mayor of a town where one foreign-owned plant  was located had told him that 'pro-union workers will be  branded and that they'll have a difficult time getting a job.  And",

      "Text": " (For other news from the Reuters Autos Summit, click on  http://www.reuters.com/summit/Autos08?pid=500)   (Adds Toyota comment)      DETROIT, Sept 16 (Reuters) - United Auto Workers President  Ron Gettelfinger said on Tuesday that the union would work hard  for the election of Democrat Barack Obama for U.S. president  and push for passage of a key union organizing law.      'I know, based on the number of members that we have  registered, based on our polling ourselves, input that we get,  we're going to come in with a very, very high margin behind our  endorsed candidate,' Gettelfinger told reporters at the Reuters  Auto Summit when asked about the UAW's backing of Obama.      'I don't look for us to be any different than what we have  been,' Gettelfinger said. 'We're very effective; we have a very  effective political action program. We're ready to go.'      Michigan is a key swing state in the November election,  with polls showing Obama and Republican John McCain in a tight  race despite thousands of job losses in the struggling U.S.  auto industry.      Gettelfinger said the UAW and other unions were working to  focus the election on issues like losses of jobs, pensions and  benefits among blue-color workers; a struggling U.S. middle  class; rising home foreclosures; soaring energy and health  costs; rising government debt and soaring trade deficits.      'It appears to me that the Republicans are running a  campaign based on distraction, and they don't want to talk  about the issues because they can't talk about the issues,'  Gettelfinger said.      In 2007, U.S. automakers saw their share of the domestic  market dip below 50 percent for the first time ever. UAW  membership fell 14 percent last year to 464,910, its lowest  level since 1941.           EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT      Gettelfinger said passage of the Employee Free Choice Act,  or EFCA, remained a key objective for the UAW.      Blocked in Congress for years, EFCA legislation would let  workers organize by signing union authorization cards, set a  time line for first contracts between unions and employees, and  impose higher fines for violating employee rights to organize.      UAW organizing of U.S. plants owned by foreign automakers  has been hampered by companies seeking to intimidate workers,  Gettelfinger said.      'The way organizing works today would be like you running  for governor of the state of Michigan. The only thing is you  can't come into Michigan, and you couldn't campaign inside  Michigan. And your opponent would be inside Michigan and  running all day long,' Gettelfinger said.      'They intimidate workers, they fire workers. If I come in  here right now and you were running an organizing drive and I  just walked over to you and said, 'You're fired,' that's going  to resonate throughout the building.'      Jim Lentz, president of Toyota's <7203.T> U.S. unit, which  operates several nonunion plants, told the Reuters Summit later  on Tuesday that its U.S. workers did not want unions.      'You'd have to ask our employees but so far they're saying  no,' Lentz said. 'As long as we continue to be true to our  culture of respecting our associates, listening to our  associates, we're in pretty good shape.'      Corporate critics claim union backing of the EFCA amounts  to denial of workers' rights to a secret vote on whether to  join a union. But Gettelfinger said UAW support of EFCA was the  same as with its support of any organized political vote.      '",

UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said in a statement issued  by the union that the alliance 'offers Chrysler new  opportunities to compete in the U.S. market and the global  marketplace.'      'As the U.S. auto industry undergoes a restructuring  process, this alliance has the potential to preserve a wide  range of choices for U.S. consumers, as well as good-paying  manufacturing jobs for our communities,' said Gettelfinger.      UAW Vice President General Holiefield, who heads the  union's negotiations with Chrysler, said the union would work  with both Chrysler and Fiat in the coming weeks.      'UAW members will have a voice as this new alliance takes  shape,' he said.      Under the deal announced on Tuesday, Fiat would take a 35  percent stake in Chrysler in exchange for sharing its small car  technology with the struggling U.S. automaker.

      "Text": "    DETROIT, March 28 (Reuters) - Membership in the United Auto  Workers union has dropped below 500,000, hitting its lowest  level since World War Two in a downturn that reflects the  wrenching restructuring by U.S. automakers.      UAW membership dropped by 14 percent from the prior year to  464,910 in 2007, according to the union's annual report, which  was released on Friday to the U.S. Department of Labor.      Membership in the union peaked at near 1.5 million in 1979  and has been declining since. Since 2001, the union has lost  over a third of its membership.      The last time the UAW had fewer than half a million members  was in 1941, according to labor historian Mike Smith of Wayne  State University's Walter P. Reuther library.      By 1945, the union's ranks had increased to about 1 million  members, Smith said.      The Detroit-based UAW negotiated historic contracts with  General Motors Corp <GM.N>, Ford Motor Co <F.N> and Chrysler  LLC last year that allow the Detroit-based automakers to  replace thousands of current workers with others at sharply  lower wages.      But union officials have said that the number of hourly  workers accepting buyouts and early retirement incentives on  offer at all three companies has been much smaller than in 2006  when some 68,000 UAW workers opted to leave Ford and GM.      U.S. employment in the auto industry peaked at 1.1 million  in 1999 but has since fallen by about 27 percent, according to  the statistics compiled by the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Center  for Automotive Research.      The center estimates that total employment by the three  Detroit-based automakers will fall another 15 percent from just  over 241,000 at the end of 2007 by 2016.      A spokesman for the UAW could not be immediately reached  for comment.

      "Text": "    DETROIT, April 9 (Reuters) - American Axle & Manufacturing  Holdings Inc <AXL.N> and the United Auto Workers resumed full  bargaining on Wednesday to try to reach an agreement to end a  6-week strike at five unionized plants in the United States.      American Axle spokeswoman Renee Rogers said the talks  resumed on Wednesday morning, but said she did not know how  long the meeting was expected to last. A UAW representative  could not be reached immediately for comment on Wednesday's  meeting.      The union and the parts supplier on Monday agreed to resume  full negotiations that were stalled for nearly a month while  the two sides sparred over financial details and American  Axle's demands for steep wage and benefit cuts.      The decision to restart full talks came after a meeting  between American Axle Chief Executive Dick Dauch and UAW  President Ron Gettelfinger, who had not met face-to-face since  negotiations began in December.      About 3,650 UAW-represented workers at American Axle went  on strike Feb. 26. The stoppage has forced General Motors Corp  <GM.N>, American Axle's main customer at about 80 percent of  revenue, to idle production at least partially at 30  facilities.      GM resumed some production of full-sized pickup trucks this  week in Indiana. It expects to resume some pickup production in  Ontario for three weeks later in April, while idling full-sized  SUV production at a Texas plant for the same period.      American Axle has said total wages and benefits run more  than $70 per hour, about three times higher than its rivals,  and it will be forced to close the five striking plants if it  cannot obtain concessions from the union.      During the period when talks stagnated over the past month,  the union had said American Axle failed to provide enough  details to evaluate the cost-cutting demands. The company gave  the UAW more financial information last week at the union's  request.      Separately, GM said on Wednesday it had reached a tentative  agreement with one of five UAW local units at GM plants that  have threatened to strike. The local units have threatened  strikes at the GM plants over slow progress in completing the  local details needed.      The tentative agreement was reached with UAW Local 1005,  which represents more than 1,300 hourly workers at a plant in  Parma, Ohio, that has been partly idled by the American Axle  strike, GM spokesman Dan Flores said.      GM remains in talks with union leaders at four other plants  where it received notices from UAW locals, Flores said. Those  plants are in Warren, Flint and Lansing-Delta Township,  Michigan; and in Arlington, Texas.      GM reached a four-year national contract with the United  Auto Workers union last year, but has yet to reach local  agreements with most of the more than 70 union locals  representing individual facilities on issues such as work  rules.

      "Text": " (Adds details from workers, statements, background, byline)      By Kevin Krolicki      DETROIT, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers began a  strike against auto parts maker American Axle & Manufacturing  Holdings Inc <AXL.N> shortly after midnight on Tuesday after  failing to reach agreement on a new contract.      The strike encompasses some 3,600 workers at American Axle  plants in Michigan and New York whose four-year contract expired  just before midnight Monday after an impasse over cost-cutting  demands from the auto parts supplier.      American Axle said the union was in effect singling the  company out for demanding wages and benefits about equal to  those that rivals now have under their own UAW agreements.      Workers in Detroit walked off the job shortly after midnight  and quickly formed a picket at a gate trudging through a blanket  of snow and carrying signs that read 'Unfair Labor Practices'  and 'UAW on Strike.'      Analysts have said a prolonged UAW strike against the  Detroit-based company has the potential to disrupt production of  trucks and sport utility vehicles by General Motors Corp <GM.N>,  which ranks as the supplier's largest customer.      American Axle had stockpiled parts for GM with the chance of  a work stoppage looming. GM accounted for nearly four-fifths of  American Axle's revenue last year.      The United Auto Workers said the strike had begun at 12:01  ET on Tuesday. Talks broke off Monday with major issues  unresolved, including demands for wage cuts of up to $14 per  hour, the union said.      Elimination of future retiree health care and defined  benefit pensions were also issues, the UAW said. The union also  said American Axle failed to provide the UAW with information it  needed to evaluate the proposed cuts.      The UAW has a 'proven record' of working with companies,  'but cooperation does not mean capitulation,' UAW President Ron  Gettelfinger said in a statement.      American Axle said its ability to maintain production at  those locations or compete for future business would be in  'immediate jeopardy' without sweeping union concessions.      The UAW contract covers facilities in Detroit and Three  Rivers, Michigan; Tonawanda and Cheektowaga, New York; and a  Buffalo, New York, plant idled in late 2007. The UAW also  represents American Axle workers at other facilities covered  under a different agreement that did not expire.      COMPANY FEELS 'SINGLED OUT'      In a statement, the Detroit-based company said the union had  'singled out' the supplier by refusing to allow it to cut hourly  labor costs that are three times higher than its rivals at over  $70 per hour.      'All of the changes we have proposed have been accepted by  the UAW in agreements with our competitors in the United  States,' Chief Executive Dick Dauch said in a statement.      The union said it had made proposals that would have reduced  American Axle's labor costs significantly and given it  operational flexibility.      The strike marks the third auto industry walkout by the UAW  in recent months in North America. The UAW called brief strikes  against GM and Chrysler LLC last year before reaching historic  agreements that allow the Detroit-based automakers to cut labor  costs as they attempt to return to profitability.      The union has also negotiated buyouts and early retirements  with the automakers intended as a way to move higher-paid  workers out of those jobs, while protecting their pension and",

      "Text": "    TORONTO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The Canadian Auto Workers union  said on Tuesday it would find cost cutting measures to remain  competitive with the U.S. arms of General Motors Corp <GM.N> and  Chrysler [CBS.UL] after the companies reached agreements in  principal with the United Autoworkers union.      'We are going to measure what the UAW just recently concluded  in bargaining and then we're going to measure it to what the  Canadian operations are, then we're going to maintain our  competitive advantage,' CAW President Ken Lewenza told reporters.      Lewenza said he did not want to speculate on what the union  might do to save the automakers money. He added that the CAW had  yet to see the terms and conditions the companies need to meet to  qualify for loans from the governments of Canada and the province  of Ontario.      GM and Chrysler are due to present their viability plans to  Ottawa on Friday.      The Detroit-based automakers presented their restructuring  plans to U.S. officials earlier on Tuesday and both asked for more  government funding to stay afloat than originally planned.      For its part, GM said it was looking for up to $30 billion  more in U.S. government aid, while Chrysler was looking for  another $5 billion.      GM said it was working to reach agreements with the UAW and  bondholders to reduce around $47 billion in debt.      GM also said it would cut its U.S. workforce by another 20,000  jobs by 2012, with most of those reductions coming earlier.      Chrysler said it plans to cut its total manpower by 3,000  people in 2009.      Lewenza called for the Canadian government to make sure that  the companies maintain a healthy job count in Canada as a  condition of giving them any loans.      'The only way that you can repay the loans, which we are  committed to do, not just as a company, but as CAW members, is to  have a manufacturing footprint in Canada that is profitable,' he  said.      Chrysler said on Tuesday it planned to start talks with the  CAW next week and GM said it planned to reach a deal on a new  contract with the union by the end of March.

      "Text": " (Adds statement from American Axle, details on union statement,  background)      DETROIT, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers began a  strike against auto parts maker American Axle & Manufacturing  Holdings Inc <AXL.N> shortly after midnight on Tuesday after  failing to reach agreement on a new contract.      Workers in Detroit walked off the job shortly after midnight  and quickly formed a picket at a gate carrying signs that read  'Unfair Labor Practices' and 'On Strike.'      The UAW contract covering about 3,600 American Axle workers  at plants in Michigan and New York expired late Monday.      Analysts have said a prolonged UAW strike against the  Detroit-based company has the potential to disrupt production of  trucks and sport utility vehicles by General Motors Corp <GM.N>,  which ranks as the supplier's largest customer.      American Axle had stockpiled parts for GM with the chance of  a work stoppage looming. GM accounted for nearly four-fifths of  American Axle's revenue last year.      In a short statement, the United Auto Workers said the  strike had begun at 12:01 ET on Tuesday. Talks broke off Monday  with major issues unresolved, including demands for wage cuts of  up to $14 per hour, the union said.

      "Text": " (Adds comment from UAW)      DETROIT, March 28 (Reuters) - Membership in the United Auto  Workers union has dropped below 500,000, hitting its lowest  level since World War Two in a downturn that reflects the  wrenching restructuring by U.S. automakers.      UAW membership dropped by 14 percent from the prior year to  464,910 in 2007, according to the union's annual report, which  was released on Friday to the U.S. Department of Labor.      Membership in the union peaked at near 1.5 million in 1979  and has been declining since. Since 2001, the union has lost  over a third of its membership.      The last time the UAW had fewer than half a million members  was in 1941, according to labor historian Mike Smith of Wayne  State University's Walter P. Reuther library.      By 1945, the union's ranks had increased to about 1 million  members, Smith said.      The Detroit-based UAW negotiated historic contracts with  General Motors Corp <GM.N>, Ford Motor Co <F.N> and Chrysler  LLC last year that allow the Detroit-based automakers to  replace thousands of current workers with others at sharply  lower wages.      But union officials have said that the number of hourly  workers accepting buyouts and early retirement incentives on  offer at all three companies has been much smaller than in 2006  when some 68,000 UAW workers opted to leave Ford and GM.      U.S. employment in the auto industry peaked at 1.1 million  in 1999 but has since fallen by about 27 percent, according to  the statistics compiled by the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Center  for Automotive Research.      The center estimates that total employment by the three  Detroit-based automakers will fall another 15 percent from just  over 241,000 at the end of 2007 by 2016.      UAW spokesman Roger Kerson said the union preferred to  track its membership using the average number of dues-paying  members over the course of the year since strikes and layoffs  can skew the reported number downward at any given time.      On that basis, the UAW's membership dropped 11 percent from  the year earlier to 512,560 in 2007.

About 1,650 of American Axle's 3,650 hourly workers  represented by the United Auto Workers have taken buyout offers  and early retirement incentives, said Bill Alford, president of  UAW Local 235, which represents about half of the supplier's  U.S. hourly workforce.      American Axle, which reached a cost-saving four-year  contract with the UAW in May, has said it aims to cut more than  2,000 jobs under the new contract.

      "Text": "    DETROIT, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Officials from the United Auto  Workers on Tuesday urged hourly workers at Ford Motor Co <F.N>  to approve a set of concessions intended to cut operating costs  and cash outlays for the No. 2 U.S. automaker at time when  global sales are tumbling.      UAW officials representing factory workers from Ford  facilities across the United States met on Tuesday in Detroit  and voted unanimously to recommend ratification of the contract  changes, the union said.      The UAW leadership at Ford also voted to complete  ratification votes on the new contract by March 9.      Ford has said the cost-saving changes negotiated midway  through a four-year contract with the UAW set to run until 2011  were needed to allow it to restructure on its own without  resorting to emergency loans from the U.S. government.      General Motors Corp <GM.N> and Chrysler LLC, which have  been kept afloat by a $17.4-billion federal bailout, also have  reached tentative agreements on new operating concessions with  the UAW.      But GM and Chrysler remain in talks with the union about  how to change funding terms for retiree healthcare.      Ford jumped ahead of its rivals by announcing this week  that it had clinched its own deal with the UAW on the issue of  how to restructure its remaining obligations for retiree  healthcare.      Under the proposed change to the Ford contract, which is  subject to both UAW ratification and court approval, the  automaker has the option of settling up to half of the payments  due to a retiree healthcare trust fund in Ford stock.      Previously, Ford had been obligated to make a $13.2 billion  cash contribution to the fund, known as a Voluntary Employee  Beneficiary Association, or VEBA.      Ford's deal with the UAW on the VEBA would save it almost  $7 billion in cash and could provide the model for concessions  at GM and Chrysler, analysts have said.      Ford and the UAW have not yet detailed the other contract  changes that will be put to unionized hourly workers for a  ratification vote.      But one of those changes will phase out a program of near  total job security for UAW workers even after their positions  have been eliminated, both sides have said.      U.S. automakers and the UAW have also been talking about  contract changes that would make it easier for the companies to  hire in new, lower-cost workers and shut down excess plants,  people familiar with the talks have said.      Ford had just under 53,000 hourly workers in North America  at the end of December, down from over 100,000 at the end of  2005, according to company data.

      "Text": "    TORONTO, June 12 (Reuters) - The fate of the blockade of  General Motors of Canada's <GM.N> headquarters in Oshawa,  Ontario by the Canadian Auto Workers union, now in its ninth  day, is in the hands of a judge on Thursday.      GM is arguing for an injunction to end the action and for  C$1.5 million ($1.47 million) in compensation from the Oshawa  local of the CAW and five of its members.      Shortly after the case began in a Whitby, Ontario, court  room, several hundred Canadian autoworkers and their supporters  kicked off a 'solidarity' rally near the Oshawa truck plant  that GM plans to close late next year.      The plant, which employs 2,600 union members, is one of  four in North America GM plans to shutter as it shifts its  focus to producing more fuel efficient vehicles in response to  changing customer demand as gasoline prices soar.      GM announced the September 2009 closure about a  week-and-a-half ago, just two weeks after it signed a  three-year labor agreement with the CAW in which it said it  would keep the plant open until 2011.      That set off cries of betrayal from the union and the  blockade of GM Canada's headquarters, which has forced about  1,000 GM office staff to work from home.      A high-level meeting between CAW leadership and top GM  officials in Detroit last Friday was fruitless, the union  said.      The CAW ramped up its protests the following day, halting  production at GM's Oshawa complex for about 45 minutes by way  of a convoy of hundreds of cars that slowly circled the plants,  preventing shipments from coming or going.      Aside from the truck plant, which produces the Chevrolet  Silverado and the GMC Sierra, the complex includes a car plant  where the Chevrolet Impala is currently built and the Camaro is  set to begin production. The province of Ontario has said it is  in discussions with GM about adding a third car to that line.

      "Text": "    By Tom Doggett      WASHINGTON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate took on the  role of Christmas Grinch for autoworkers when it failed on  Thursday to pass a $14 billion rescue package for Detroit's  three major car manufacturers.      Attention now turns to the Bush administration's Treasury  Department, who Reid and other supporters of a bailout said  should dip into the $700 billion fund Congress created to help  Wall Street firms and banks, and lend automakers the money they  need to avoid bankruptcy and save millions of jobs.      The Senate late on Thursday came only a few 'yes' votes  short of the 60 needed to block a filibuster on the bailout  bill, effectively killing any chance of Congress providing a  lifeline to the financially drowning automakers this year.      'It's going to be a very, very bad Christmas for a lot of  people based on what takes place here tonight,' Senate Majority  Leader Harry Reid told his colleagues before the vote. 'It's  over with.'      A Treasury Department official declined to comment on the  Senate's failure to approve the rescue package and said it was  up to the White House to respond.      White House spokesman Tony Fratto said the administration  would evaluate its options 'in light of the breakdown in  Congress,' saying the legislation had 'presented the best  chance to avoid a disorderly bankruptcy while ensuring taxpayer  funds only go to firms whose stakeholders were prepared to make  difficult decisions to become viable.'      Markets across the Asia-Pacific region were down more than  3 percent after news the talks had collapsed, with Japan's  Nikkei average and Hong Kong's Hang Seng both down more than 5  percent.      U.S. crude oil prices fell more $2 toward $45 a barrel on  news of the bailout bust.      Senators negotiated late into the night on a possible  compromise that participants said fell apart over proposed wage  concessions by the powerful United Auto Workers union.      'We were three words away from a deal,' said Sen. Bob    Corker, a Tennessee Republican who proposed the alternative and  led the talks.      Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, said the  main issue of disagreement was the date to require the Detroit  autoworkers' pay parity with foreign-based U.S. auto  manufacturers.      General Motors Corp <GM.N> and Chrysler LLC are seeking  billions of dollars in immediate aid, while Ford Motor Co <F.N>  wants a hefty line of credit.      The industry is reeling from depressed sales, made worse by  the credit crunch and the recession and GM and Chrysler said  government intervention was required now to avert potential  failure.      The House of Representatives passed its version of a  Democratic-sponsored bailout on Wednesday, but Senate  Republicans rejected that measure.

      "Text": "    By Doug Palmer      WASHINGTON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - U.S. autoworkers and  troubled automaker Chrysler urged Congress on Wednesday not to  approve a free trade pact with South Korea until it has been  renegotiated to address their concerns.      The deal struck in April 2007 by the Bush administration  'would threaten the jobs of tens of thousands of American  workers, exacerbating the already serious difficulties facing  the U.S. auto industry and its workers and retirees,' said Ron  Gettelfinger, president of the United Auto Workers union.      Gettelfinger told the Senate Commerce Committee the  agreement fails to tear down South Korean regulatory barriers  that have long thwarted sales of U.S. and other foreign cars,  even though South Korea would be required to immediately  eliminate its tariffs on U.S. cars and trucks.      John Bozzella, Chrysler's vice president for external  affairs and public policy, said the agreement 'narrows, but  does not eliminate discrimination against U.S. auto importers'  in South Korea and rewards that country for failing to live up  to previous auto trade deals.      The warnings came on the same day the U.S. House of  Representatives approved $25 billion in loans to help Chrysler,  Ford <F.N> and General Motors <GM.N> through current hard  times. That legislation now goes to the Senate for a vote.      Last year, South Korea exported 668,000 autos to the United  States, but imported only 6,500 U.S. vehicles      Presidential Democratic candidate Barack Obama has promised  to negotiate the trade deal if elected. His Republican rival  John McCain has urged approval of the pact.      The agreement enjoys broad support outside the auto sector  from many farm and business groups eager to increase sales in  South Korea's $1 trillion economy.      Myron Brilliant, president of the U.S.-Korea Business  Council, said the pact does tackle many 'non-tariff barriers'  the U.S. auto sector has long complained about.      South Korea also pledged not to 'discourage the purchase or  use of U.S. goods or services -- an important commitment in  light of the past anti-import campaigns in Korea,' he said.      The U.S. International Trade Commission has estimated the  agreement would likely have a 'negligible' effect on overall  U.S. auto trade, Brilliant said.      The independent trade panel forecast auto imports from  South Korea would increase under the pact, but said most gains  would come at the expense of other foreign suppliers.      The Bush administration still hopes lawmakers will approve  the agreement this year in a possible lame duck session of  Congress after the Nov. 4 elections.      Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Bryon Dorgan, a North  Dakota Democrat and foe of Bush administration trade deals,  said lawmakers would not approve the pact in 2008.      'I believe unless it's modified in a very substantial way  it's not going to be approved by any Congress,' Dorgan said.

      "Text": "    TORONTO, June 4 (Reuters) - Angry autoworkers blockaded the  entrance to General Motors of Canada <GM.N> headquarters in  Oshawa, Ontario on Wednesday, one day after GM said it would  shut its Oshawa truck plant.      'We're not allowing any GM of Canada employees to enter the  headquarters building,' said Chris Buckley, of the Canadian  Auto Workers union, which says 2,600 jobs will go if the truck  plant closes.      'We are going to stay here until General Motors reverses  the decision they made yesterday, or at the very least commits  to a product for the Oshawa truck plant, or sits down  face-to-face with this union to try to explain why they have  broken our brand new agreement.'      TV pictures showed some 100 autoworkers on a road leading  to the Oshawa plant, which is to be closed as GM tries to shore  up a restructuring plan that has been overtaken by a steep  decline in U.S. sales of pickup trucks and SUVs in the face of  surging gas prices and tighter credit.      Two plants in the United States and one in Mexico are also  slated to close.      The CAW says the closure of the Oshawa plant is a betrayal.  GM and the CAW signed a new three-year collective bargaining  agreement on May 15 that included a wage freeze and GM promises  to boost production in Canada rather than cut it.      Under that deal, GM said it would start producing hybrid  versions of two of its trucks at the Oshawa plant.      The plant currently produces the Chevrolet Silverado and  the GMC Sierra crew-cab and extended-cab pickup trucks, which  GM Canada spokesman Stew Low said are taking the biggest hit of  GM's products in the U.S.      He said the hybrid versions of the Silverado and Sierra  would still be built and rolled out at the end of the year, but  at other plants, either in the United States or in Mexico.      'Our main customer is the U.S. and there is a huge and very  drastic shift away from trucks and SUVs and we have to react to  that because we can't continue to buy vehicles that people  aren't buying,' Low said.      U.S. auto sales figures released on Tuesday showed that GM  truck sales were down 39 percent in May from May last year.  Sales of the Silverado down 44 percent and those of the GMC  Sierra down 33.9 percent.

And it's costing them millions each year.\n\n\u2022 Click here to see photos of the UAW's $33 million retreat.\n\nThe UAW, known more for its strikes than its slices, hosts seminars and junkets at the Walter and May Reuther Family Education Center in Onaway, Mich., which is nestled on \"1,000 heavily forested acres\" on Michigan's Black Lake, according to its Web site.\n\nBut the Black Lake club and retreat, which are among the union's biggest fixed assets, have lost $23 million in the past five years alone, a heavy albatross around the union's neck as it tries to manage a multibillion-dollar pension plan crisis.\n\nCritics call it a resort for union leaders that wastes money from union dues.\n\n\"It's their members' money that they're spending on this thing,\" said Justin Wilson, managing director of the Center for Union Facts, a union watchdog group. \"The union has bigger issues at hand than managing a golf course.\"\n\nManaging the course may become a burden for the union. The UAW covers costs for the Reuther Center from the interest it earns on its strike fund, according to tax documents, but massive losses in the past five years have forced the union to make heavy loans to keep the center afloat. Critics call it a poor investment for a group with over $1.25 billion in assets.\n\n\"Unions certainly have had real estate investments in the past, but investments are supposed to make money, not bleed money,\" said Wilson.\n\nThe UAW did not return calls from FOXNews.com, and a spokesman could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe Reuther Center is open 11 months of the year to offer courses on leadership, political action, civil rights and other topics; it hosts nearly 10,000 visitors annually. The UAW says it sends workers there to \"learn, experience unionism (and) commit to labor's cause,\" according to their Web site.\n\nThe center was purchased in 1967 and underwent massive renovations in the '90s under the careful watch of former UAW president Steve Yokich. \"Today's Black Lake might not exist if not for Steve Yokich,\" said union member Bob Reidt, whom Yokich appointed as Black Lake's director. \"Yokich is responsible for rebuilding Black Lake.\"\n\nThe UAW erected a monument to its longtime president Walter Reuther \u2014 the center's namesake \u2014 which bears an inscription of his words: \"There is no greater calling than to serve your brother. There is no greater satisfaction than to have done it well.\"\n\nBut Reuther, who died in a plane crash en route to the center in 1970, never knew the satisfaction of Black Lake's \"well-groomed fairways,\" a course that Michigan Golf Magazine called a \"stunning visual marvel.\"\n\nUnion members can play golf at discounted rates on one of the country's top 100 courses, designed in 2000 by famed course architect Rees Jones at a cost of $6 million.\n\nThe center has a storied history. Reuther had his ashes scattered at the site, and Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz honeymooned there in 1940, well before it was bought by the UAW.\n\n\"It's funny that they call it an education center \u2014 it's a resort,\" said Wilson. \"If I was a union member, I would prefer that they rented out a room at the Ramada Inn.\"",

      "Text": "  (Adds South Korean prime minister, paragraph 16-17)      By Doug Palmer      WASHINGTON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - U.S. autoworkers and  troubled automaker Chrysler urged Congress on Wednesday not to  approve a free trade pact with South Korea until it has been  renegotiated to address their concerns.      The deal struck in April 2007 by the Bush administration  'would threaten the jobs of tens of thousands of American  workers, exacerbating the already serious difficulties facing  the U.S. auto industry and its workers and retirees,' said Ron  Gettelfinger, president of the United Auto Workers union.      Gettelfinger told the Senate Commerce Committee the  agreement fails to tear down South Korean regulatory barriers  that have long thwarted sales of U.S. and other foreign cars,  even though South Korea would be required to immediately  eliminate its tariffs on U.S. cars and trucks.      John Bozzella, Chrysler's vice president for external  affairs and public policy, said the agreement 'narrows, but  does not eliminate discrimination against U.S. auto importers'  in South Korea and rewards that country for failing to live up  to previous auto trade deals.      The warnings came on the same day the U.S. House of  Representatives approved $25 billion in loans to help Chrysler,  Ford and General Motors through current hard times. That  legislation now goes to the Senate for a vote.      Last year, South Korea exported 668,000 autos to the United  States, but imported only 6,500 U.S. vehicles      Presidential Democratic candidate Barack Obama has promised  to negotiate the trade deal if elected. His Republican rival  John McCain has urged approval of the pact.           SUPPORT FROM FARM, BUSINESS GROUPS      The agreement enjoys broad support outside the auto sector  from many farm and business groups eager to increase sales in  South Korea's $1 trillion economy.      Myron Brilliant, president of the U.S.-Korea Business  Council, said the pact does tackle many 'non-tariff barriers'  the U.S. auto sector has long complained about.      South Korea also pledged not to 'discourage the purchase or  use of U.S. goods or services -- an important commitment in  light of the past anti-import campaigns in Korea,' he said.      The U.S. International Trade Commission has estimated the  agreement would likely have a 'negligible' effect on overall  U.S. auto trade, Brilliant said.      The independent trade panel forecast auto imports from  South Korea would increase under the pact, but said most gains  would come at the expense of other foreign suppliers.      The Bush administration still hopes lawmakers will approve  the agreement this year in a possible lame duck session of  Congress after the Nov. 4 elections.      Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Bryon Dorgan, a North  Dakota Democrat and foe of Bush administration trade deals,  said lawmakers would not approve the pact in 2008.      'I believe unless it's modified in a very substantial way  it's not going to be approved by any Congress,' Dorgan said.      Speaking to the Asia Society think tank in New York, South  Korean Prime Minister Han Seung-soo said his country still  hoped for the bill's passage -- if necessary in a lame duck  session of Congress after the Nov. 4 election.      'It will be beneficial not only to Korea, but also to the  United States and to the world,' Han said.

      "Text": "    TORONTO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The Canadian Auto Workers union  said on Tuesday it would find cost cutting measures to remain  competitive with the U.S. arms of General Motors Corp <GM.N> and  Chrysler [CBS.UL] after the companies reached agreements in  principal with the United Autoworkers union.      'We are going to measure what the UAW just recently concluded  in bargaining and then we're going to measure it to what the  Canadian operations are, then we're going to maintain our  competitive advantage,' CAW President Ken Lewenza told reporters.      Lewenza said he did not want to speculate on what the union  might do to save the automakers money. He added that the CAW had  yet to see the terms and conditions the companies need to meet to  qualify for loans from the governments of Canada and the province  of Ontario.      GM and Chrysler are due to present their viability plans to  Ottawa on Friday.      The Detroit-based automakers presented their restructuring  plans to U.S. officials earlier on Tuesday and both asked for more  government funding to stay afloat than originally planned.      For its part, GM said it was looking for up to $30 billion  more in U.S. government aid, while Chrysler was looking for  another $5 billion.      GM said it was working to reach agreements with the UAW and  bondholders to reduce around $47 billion in debt.      GM also said it would cut its U.S. workforce by another 20,000  jobs by 2012, with most of those reductions coming earlier.      Chrysler said it plans to cut its total manpower by 3,000  people in 2009.      Lewenza called for the Canadian government to make sure that  the companies maintain a healthy job count in Canada as a  condition of giving them any loans.      'The only way that you can repay the loans, which we are  committed to do, not just as a company, but as CAW members, is to  have a manufacturing footprint in Canada that is profitable,' he  said.      Chrysler said on Tuesday it planned to start talks with the  CAW next week and GM said it planned to reach a deal on a new  contract with the union by the end of March.

      "Text": "    By John McCrank      TORONTO, June 26 (Reuters) - Canadian autoworkers  acknowledged that General Motors Corp's <GM.N> decision to  close a Oshawa, Ontario, truck plant next year was irrevocable,  a union leader said on Thursday after a meeting with company  officials.      'Are we accepting it? Eventually, if someone keeps hitting  you over the head with a sledgehammer, you're going to wake  up,' said Buzz Hargrove, president of the Canadian Auto  Workers, said at the union's headquarters.      Hargrove said GM told the union it may decide to build a  new model in its Oshawa car plant, where the new Chevrolet  Camaro muscle car is set to begin production, but he added the  situation looked bleak.      'We talked about putting together an incentive program that  will help with the downsizing of the Oshawa operation over the  next four or five years,' said Hargrove.      The CAW said it would take a couple of weeks to look at the  GM proposal on incentives before responding.      About 2,600 unionized workers will lose their jobs when the  truck plant is closed.      GM's announcement of the closure ignited a firestorm of  protest that included a 12-day blockade of GM Canada's  headquarters. It came just two-weeks after the company signed a  new three-year labor agreement with the union in which it said  it would keep the plant open until at least 2011.      An Ontario judge ordered an end to the blockade, but added  that GM acted with 'almost deceitful behavior' in the contract  negotiations, which could make future bargaining difficult.      The union has not totally given up hope on the fate of the  plant, hoping the cyclical nature of the auto industry will  allow GM to reopen it in the future, said Chris Buckley,  president of CAW Local 222, in Oshawa.      'Their business is changing every month ... so we're hoping  that over the next year or two... things will turn around  somewhat,' he said, saying the union hoped GM could eventually  find a vehicle that could fit into the Oshawa truck plant  without a huge capital expenditure.      'The key is for them not to demolish that facility,' he  said.      GM shares dropped to their lowest in 53 years on Thursday  after Goldman Sachs cut the struggling U.S. auto industry's  largest manufacturer to a 'sell rating' and warned it would  have to raise capital. See [ID:nN26451117]      The housing and credit crises in the United States, along  with the high price of gasoline, has put a big dent in U.S.  auto sales, especially trucks and SUV's.      GM makes the Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra at the  Oshawa truck plant. It is one of four truck plants in North  America the company said it would shutter to scale back  production.      GM officials left the meeting without speaking to  reporters.

      "Text": "    CINCINNATI, June 3 (Reuters) - The union representing  autoworkers at the General Motors Corp <GM.N> truck plant in  Moraine, Ohio, said on Tuesday it will fight plans to close the  assembly plant, one of four on the chopping block.      Gaylen Turner, president of IUE-CWA Local 798 representing  some 2,300 current workers at the Moraine plant, said GM's  decision to shutter the plant, announced earlier on Tuesday,  was not a surprise but would be opposed by the union.      'We anticipate having additional meetings, sitting down and  talking about contractual issues, meeting with the  international union to see where we go from here and what can  be done,' Turner said.      'Never never means never. Until they tell me there is no  other chance, I'm going to continue to fight to do what we can  do to keep the place open. I'm going to fight as long as I  can,' he added.      He said the Detroit automaker's decision to close the  Moraine plant is sad but not unanticipated, since it was  already being downsized and lacked product plans after 2010.      'I don't know if you're ever ready for it. People  understood that it was something that could happen. But you  always hold out hope,' Turner said.      GM said on Tuesday it was closing four truck plants and  could sell its Hummer brand to cut its output of slow-selling  trucks and SUVs in response to higher gasoline prices that the  automaker now sees as a permanent threat to its business.      The Moraine plant makes GM's Envoy, Trailblazer and Saab  models. As of Monday, more than 300 workers had accepted  'special attrition packages,' Turner said.      Tony Curington, a union representative for displaced  workers in the area, said the plant closing would only add to  an already stressed economy.      'Some people were hoping they'd keep that facility open.  But now this has sealed their fate,' Curington said. 'You are  going to have a lot of dislocated workers who will be depending  on a lot of social services. There is nowhere for them to turn.  The manufacturing industry has dried up around here. It is  really going to devastate the area.'      GM said the latest steps would cut $1 billion from its  structural costs by 2010, but analysts questioned whether the  steps would improve the automaker's turnaround prospects in the  face of a U.S. market now seen slumping well into 2009.      GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said higher gasoline prices  have caused consumers to swap out of higher-margin trucks and  SUVs faster than GM had expected.      'U.S. economic and market conditions have become  significantly more difficult,' he said.      GM shares, which have lost almost 60 percent since peaking  in October last year, were up 29 cents or 1.7 percent at $17.73  in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

      "Text": " (Adds details, comments, background)      OSHAWA, Ontario, June 4 (Reuters) - Hundreds of angry  autoworkers blockaded the entrance to General Motors of  Canada's <GM.N> headquarters in Oshawa, Ontario, on Wednesday,  demanding the company reverse its decision to close the local  truck plant and crying foul over the timing of the closure.      'We're not allowing any GM of Canada employees to enter the  headquarters building,' said Chris Buckley, of the Canadian  Auto Workers union, which says 2,600 jobs will go if the truck  plant closes.      'We are going to stay here until General Motors reverses  the decision they made yesterday, or at the very least commits  to a product for the Oshawa truck plant, or sits down  face-to-face with this union to try to explain why they have  broken our brand new agreement.'      GM said it would meet with the union in Detroit on Friday.      The company announced on Tuesday it would closed the Oshawa  plant, and three others in North America, as it tries to shore  up a restructuring plan that has been overtaken by a steep  decline in U.S. sales of pickup trucks and SUVs in the face of  surging gas prices and tight credit.      Two truck plants in the United States and one in Mexico are  also slated to close.      Up to 750 people, many clad in red T-shirts emblazoned with  a white maple leaf and the words 'Made in Canada matters',  peacefully blocked the road leading to GM's Canadian  headquarters.      'I feel sick about this situation and all I can do is  visualize GM workers on the welfare line,' said Jim Bedford, a  retired GM employee from nearby Bowmanville, Ontario.           BARGAINING FAITH QUESTIONED      The CAW, which has around 13,000 members at GM, says the  closure of the Oshawa plant is a betrayal. GM and the CAW  signed a new three-year labor agreement on May 15 that included  a wage freeze and a promise by GM to boost production in Canada  rather than cut it.      Under that deal, GM said it would start producing hybrid  versions of two of its trucks at the Oshawa plant.      The plant currently produces the Chevrolet Silverado and  the GMC Sierra crew-cab and extended-cab pickup trucks, which  GM Canada spokesman Stew Low said are taking the biggest hit of  GM's products in the U.S.      He said the hybrid versions of the Silverado and Sierra  would still be built and rolled out at the end of the year, but  at other plants, either in the United States or in Mexico.      Auto analyst Dennis DesRosiers said in a note that the  final decision to close the Oshawa plant probably had not yet  been made during the bargaining, but the company most likely  had an idea of what it wanted to do.      'The real reason is that they didn't have to and it would  weaken their position in the labor talks ... And why would GM  provide him (CAW President Buzz Hargrove) this information  which would only have strengthened the CAW position and  hardened the resolve of the CAW.'           U.S. CONSUMERS WANT FUEL ECONOMY      GM's Low said the closure boils down to a rapid shift in  customer demand away from larger gas-guzzlers as pump prices  surged to record levels.      'Our main customer is the U.S. and there is a huge and very  drastic shift away from trucks and SUVs and we have to react to  that because we can't continue to buy vehicles that people  aren't buying,' Low said.      U.S. auto sales figures released on Tuesday showed GM truck  sales were down 39 percent in May from a year earlier. Sa",

      "Text": " (Adds finance minister's comments in final three paragraphs)      OSHAWA, Ontario, June 4 (Reuters) - Hundreds of angry  autoworkers blockaded the entrance to General Motors of  Canada's <GM.N> headquarters in Oshawa, Ontario, on Wednesday,  demanding the company reverse its decision to close the local  truck plant and crying foul over the timing of the closure.      'We're not allowing any GM of Canada employees to enter the  headquarters building,' said Chris Buckley, of the Canadian  Auto Workers union, which says 2,600 jobs will go if the truck  plant closes.      'We are going to stay here until General Motors reverses  the decision they made yesterday, or at the very least commits  to a product for the Oshawa truck plant, or sits down  face-to-face with this union to try to explain why they have  broken our brand new agreement.'      GM said it would meet with the union in Detroit on Friday.      The company announced on Tuesday it would closed the Oshawa  plant, and three others in North America, as it tries to shore  up a restructuring plan that has been overtaken by a steep  decline in U.S. sales of pickup trucks and SUVs in the face of  surging gas prices and tight credit.      Two truck plants in the United States and one in Mexico are  also slated to close.      Up to 750 people, many clad in red T-shirts emblazoned with  a white maple leaf and the words 'Made in Canada matters',  peacefully blocked the road leading to GM's Canadian  headquarters.      'I feel sick about this situation and all I can do is  visualize GM workers on the welfare line,' said Jim Bedford, a  retired GM employee from nearby Bowmanville, Ontario.           BARGAINING FAITH QUESTIONED      The CAW, which has around 13,000 members at GM, says the  closure of the Oshawa plant is a betrayal. GM and the CAW  signed a new three-year labor agreement on May 15 that included  a wage freeze and a promise by GM to boost production in Canada  rather than cut it.      Under that deal, GM said it would start producing hybrid  versions of two of its trucks at the Oshawa plant.      The plant currently produces the Chevrolet Silverado and  the GMC Sierra crew-cab and extended-cab pickup trucks, which  GM Canada spokesman Stew Low said are taking the biggest hit of  GM's products in the United States.      He said the hybrid versions of the Silverado and Sierra  would still be built and rolled out at the end of the year, but  at other plants, either in the United States or in Mexico.      Auto analyst Dennis DesRosiers said in a note that the  final decision to close the Oshawa plant probably had not yet  been made during the bargaining, but the company most likely  had an idea of what it wanted to do.      'The real reason is that they didn't have to and it would  weaken their position in the labor talks ... And why would GM  provide (CAW President Buzz Hargrove) this information which  would only have strengthened the CAW position and hardened the  resolve of the CAW.'           U.S. CONSUMERS WANT FUEL ECONOMY      GM's Low said the closure boils down to a rapid shift in  customer demand away from larger gas-guzzlers as pump prices  surged to record levels.      'Our main customer is the U.S. and there is a huge and very  drastic shift away from trucks and SUVs and we have to react to  that because we can't continue to buy vehicles that people  aren't buying,' Low said.      U.S. auto sales figures released on Tuesday showed GM truck  sales were down 39 percent ",

      "Text": "    NEW YORK, Dec 21 (Reuters) - A forced restructuring at  General Motors Corp <GM.N> could make the U.S. automaker's debt  appealing, according to weekly business newspaper Barron's in  its Dec. 22 edition.      The report said that under a U.S. government bailout, which  requires the automaker take steps to ensure its viability, GM  may renegotiate some debt and trim pay and benefits for its  union-member autoworkers. The report cited employee costs as  hurting bondholders and shareholders in the past.      'There could be value in GM bonds if the company  restructures,' the report said. Still, there are risks,  especially if there was a future bankruptcy, which could  drastically lower any recovery value.      GM unsecured debt rallied on Friday after GM and Chrysler  LLC [CBS.UL] were extended a $17.4 billion lifeline by the  United States. Rival Ford Motor Co <F.N> said it did not at  this time need federal funds.

      "Text": "    NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The union representing  striking machinists at Boeing <BA.N> on Monday said the two  sides have reached a tentative deal and the union will hold a  vote this week.      The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace  Workers (IAM) said it reached a tentative agreement with Boeing  Co <BA.N>, which could mean the end of the strike that began on  Sept. 6.      The specific Boeing representative, who would be  knowledgeable about the deal, could not be reached immediately  for comment.      The tentative four-year contract would provide job security  and limit the amount of work outside vendors can perform in the  workplace, the union said.      The agreement was hammered out over a five-day period with  assistance from federal mediators.      Among the other issues resolved in the latest round of  bargaining were wage rates, health care benefits for current  and future employees, pension improvements and work rule  changes designed to improve productivity, the union said in a  statement.      The union said that details of the accord would be withheld  until they can be compiled and distributed to IAM members in  all Boeing locations.      The tentative agreement has the unanimous endorsement of  the IAM negotiating committee and will be presented to members  for a ratification vote, which will take place in three to five  days. A simple majority is required to ratify the tentative  agreement, the union said.      The IAM represents nearly 27,000 employees at Boeing  facilities in Kansas, Oregon and Washington and California.

      "Text": "    WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Aug 7 (Reuters) - A mediator brought  together officials from Potash Corp of Saskatchewan <POT.TO>  and the United Steelworkers union on Thursday for what a union  spokesman said were pivotal talks on a contract dispute at  three mines.      'This meeting is really crucial,' said Roger Falconer of  the United Steelworkers ahead of the face-to-face talks, adding  he was hopeful mediator Vic Pathe would help broker a deal.      About 500 workers at the Saskatchewan mines have rejected a  contract offer from Potash Corp, the world's largest fertilizer  maker. They are refusing to work overtime, but the only strike  to date has been a one-day stoppage at a single mine.      Potash Corp is reaping record profits from the world's  insatiable demand for fertilizer to boost yields of pricey  crops, leaving the company and its competitors essentially sold  out of potash at a time of sky-high prices.      Potash stock was down 31 Canadian cents at C$188.99 on the  Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday.      The stock plunged earlier this week to four-month lows  following a broad sell-off in commodity markets. But it is  still more than double what it was last year.      Union members have said they want a bigger share of the  profits, and the market conditions give them a strong  bargaining position, Falconer said.      'The company has to realize it's not dealing with the same  set of circumstances they have in the last four or five sets of  bargaining' talks, he said.      A spokesman for the company declined comment on Thursday's  meeting. 'I would simply say that the mediation process is  ongoing,' Bill Johnson said.      If there is not significant movement toward a deal at the  meeting, union members were prepared to begin strikes that  could affect the company's production, Falconer said.      'I can tell you categorically that our members are ready to  hit the picket lines immediately,' he said.      The union staged a one-day strike last week at one of the  mines, but have since worked all but overtime hours after their  union and the company resumed talks. Mediator Pathe has met  with both sides separately since Monday.      The company has said the offer rejected by workers would be  the richest in the potash industry. Neither side has commented  on specifics in the offer, but media reports have said it would  boost pay by 27 to 35.6 percent over three years at one mine.

The source said the refinery, operated by petrochemicals  firm Ineos, has a total of three crude distillation units, one  large and two smaller, which process crude oil for further  refining into motor fuels and materials for petchem production.      One of the two smaller units is being shut, while the other  two remain in operation, the source said.

      "Text": "    WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Canadian grain  handler Viterra Inc <VT.TO> was slated to hold mediated  contract talks with grain and office workers beginning on  Thursday, the company and the Grain Services Union said.      Unionized workers at the company's head office in Regina,  Saskatchewan have been on strike over wages and benefits since  early July.      Grain handlers warned the company they would begin  escalating action during harvest, and now have picket lines at  four country locations, the union said in an update to its  members on its web site.      The affected sites include Balgonie, the Moose Jaw seed  plant, Shaunavon and Swift Current. A company spokesman was not  immediately able to confirm the affected sites.      Viterra was slated to meet with a federal mediator and the  bargaining committee for operations and maintenance workers  later in the day, with talks expanding on Friday to include  representatives of the office workers, the union said.      A union spokesman was not immediately available for  comment.      Viterra, which reported stronger-than-expected quarterly  profits on Wednesday, has said the strike has had little impact  on its operations to date and said it expected to keep  elevators running during harvest.      More than 600 of its elevator workers are in a legal strike  position along with about 200 office workers. Viterra has a  total work force of about 4,000.

      "Text": " (The following statement was released by the ratings agency)      June 9 - Moody's Investors Service has today upgraded to A3  from Baa1 the senior unsecured issuer and debt ratings of Union  Fenosa SA <UNF.MC> and its guaranteed subsidiary Union Fenosa  Finance BV. The outlook is stable. The Prime-2 short-term rating  is affirmed.      The rating upgrade recognises the company's steady progress  in improving and stabilising its business and financial risk  profile and Moody's view that the company will continue to  maintain a credit profile commensurate with an A3 rating over the  medium term.      According to Moody's, Union Fenosa has demonstrated a strong  track record on delivering against its strategic plan and its  improvement in business risk has been achieved through timely  execution of its capex plans and the strategic alliances it has  formed, whilst its financial profile has improved and stabilised  via asset divestments and cash flow growth. The company today  maintains a sound position within the Spanish electricity sector  with a market share of around 13%, benefiting from its vertically  integrated position and a well-hedged thermal generation  portfolio with favourable gas contracts. Moody's also believes  that the recent acquisition of a stake in the Kangra mine in  South Africa should help Union Fenosa in hedging its coal-fired  assets.      The company has an efficient generation portfolio, but is  nonetheless exposed to greater commodity price risk than its  larger Iberian peers given its greater thermal generation bias  and mid-market gas position. Moody's cautions that a degree of  overcapacity in the Spanish electricity sector  -  particularly  if some competitors make further large investments in generation   -  could lead to greater pricing volatility, which might have an  adverse impact on the company's margins. Around 25-30% of Union  Fenosa's EBITDA comes from higher-risk international business,  although Moody's does not expect this to substantially increase  in the intermediate term.      Union Fenosa's financial profile is expected to gradually  improve over the life of the strategic plan to 2011 based on its  current EUR6.1 billion investment programme. Moody's would expect  Union Fenosa to continue to demonstrate financial discipline with  regard to further investments or acquisitions outside of the  plan. As a result, the company should be able to maintain the  following credit metrics: RCF/adjusted debt in the mid-teens,  FFO/debt in the high teens/low twenties and FFO/interest of 4x,  assuming a similar business risk profile, for the current A3  category. These guidelines could shift higher or lower in the  event that the company makes riskier or less risky investments,  respectively, outside its current strategic plan.      Moody's notes that Union Fenosa's controlling shareholder  ACS, with 45%, also owns a direct 7.8% stake in Iberdrola (and an  additional 5.2% via equity swaps) and has commented that it would  envisage Union Fenosa playing a role in any further consolidation  of the Spanish utility sector. Should such a development occur  involving further asset acquisition, Moody's would expect that a  larger market share and a more diversified generation portfolio  could benefit Union Fenosa's business risk profile. Moody's  further expects that in such circumstances the company would  ensure that an appropriate financial profile is achieved  commensurate with the current rating.      The rat",

      "Text": "    By Alex Dobuzinskis      LOS ANGELES, June 19 (Reuters) - Ahead of a big fundraising  event next week, many Hollywood power players are rallying  behind Barack Obama in his bid for U.S. president, pledging  money and starpower after lending early support to his one-time  rival Hillary Clinton.      Experts say that since Clinton conceded defeat earlier this  month in her bid to be the Democratic candidate, celebrities  have quickly united behind Obama.      The result, they said, could be a campaign cash windfall  for the senator from Illinois, but star support doesn't  necessarily transfer directly to votes.      A Tuesday fundraiser in downtown Los Angeles is expected to  attract a host of Hollywood stars and feature a performance by  the singer Seal at a cost of $2,300 per ticket.      Director Steven Spielberg and his partner in the Dreamworks  movie studio, David Geffen, and Dreamworks Animation Chief  Executive Officer Jeffrey Katzenberg are organizing another  Obama fundraiser for later this year, said Andy Spahn, a  consultant to the Hollywood power-trio.      'If a Hollywood celebrity puts his or her mind to it,  they're good money raisers,' said analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe,  a senior scholar at the University of Southern California.      'Barbra Streisand, you put her in concert and you raise  fortunes for Democrats, or Bruce Springsteen,' Jeffe said.      Mitchell Schwartz, who was Obama's California campaign  manager through the primary election season, said Obama's  appeal in Hollywood had been limited, until now.      'I don't think we were the Hollywood candidate -- ever,'  Schwartz said. 'I think Hillary might have been more, she might  have had more support.'           ALIGNING THE STARS      Other Obama celebrity endorsers include talk show host  Oprah Winfrey and actors Robert De Niro, Tom Hanks, Scarlett  Johansson and Halle Berry.      Billionaire Geffen upset many Hollywood power players and  political supporters last year when the longtime Clinton  supporter broke for Obama.      Oscar winner Hanks, the star of 'The Da Vinci Code,' gave  money to Bill Clinton's legal defense fund when he was  president, but endorsed Obama with an online video in early  May, when Hillary Clinton was still campaigning.      In the video, Hanks joked that celebrity endorsements do  little to sway voters, and Jeffe said that while stars can help  raise cash, agreed that their appeal may also do harm if voters  consider celebrities too liberal.      During the primaries, Obama had trouble attracting Hispanic  voters in some states because, analysts said, some Hispanics  were reluctant to vote for a black candidate.      But a pro-Obama video in Spanish with Hispanic actors  Jessica Alba of 'The Love Guru,' John Leguizamo of 'The  Happening' and comedian George Lopez, has attracted more than  250,000 viewers on the video sharing site YouTube.com.      'It helps build a broader sense of a candidate's support,'  said professor Chon Noriega, director of the University of  California, Los Angeles, Chicano Studies Research Center. 'But  I don't think that because George Lopez said support (a  candidate) somebody's going to say, 'Well that's who I'm going  to vote for.''      Presumptive Republican candidate Sen. John McCain also has  his celebrity endorsers, including actors Robert Duvall and  Sylvester Stallone.

      "Text": " (Updates with details, quotes, paragraphs 3-7)      By Alex Dobuzinskis      LOS ANGELES, June 19 (Reuters) - Many Hollywood celebrities  who had supported Hillary Clinton are rallying behind Barack  Obama, pledging money and star power to the Democrat's U.S.  presidential bid before a big fundraiser next week.      Experts say that since Clinton conceded defeat this month  after a grueling Democratic nominating contest, celebrities  have quickly united behind Obama.      The result, they said, could be a campaign cash windfall  for the senator from Illinois, but star support doesn't  necessarily translate directly to votes.      Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior scholar at the University of  Southern California, said that once a politician becomes known,  voters look for candidates with positions they like and with  whom they can identify, regardless of celebrity backing.      In fact, stars can cause harm if a performer's public image  rubs voters the wrong way. That happened when Jane Fonda and  Barbra Streisand campaigned for former Texas Gov. Ann Richards  in her conservative state, and Richards lost the bid.      'Sometimes they can come back to bite the candidate,' Jeffe  said.      But Los Angeles is a town where stars wield a great deal of  power and have money to spend, and numerous celebrities are  expected to turn out at a Tuesday fundraiser featuring the  singer Seal -- at a cost of $2,300 per ticket.

      "Text": "A year after electing Barack Obama president, and five years after his star turn at the Democratic National Convention, we are still trying to figure him out.\n\nIs he a left-wing radical or is he a crowd-pleasing moderate? Is he a uniter? Is he actually religious? Is he a socialist? Does he hate America? And, in light of the confidence he projects, why can\u2019t he seem to take criticism?\n\nBut we could, of course, write that first sentence another way: Only a year after electing Barack Obama president, and we are already trying to figure him out.\n\nRather than it being kind of late to attempt a rigorous analysis of President Obama\u2019s psyche, his political philosophy and his managerial style, perhaps it\u2019s a little too soon. Presidential personalities, after all, develop over time. And the famous saying is true that great leaders aren\u2019t born, but made.\n\nNonetheless, because I\u2019m too young for caution, and too old for fear, I\u2019m more than happy to take a stab at it.\n\nLet me first assuage the fears of many of my conservative friends and colleagues: Barack Obama is not a left-wing radical. He is not a socialist, a communist or a Marxist, and he\u2019s not a black liberation theologist. He\u2019s not un-American, he\u2019s not an atheist, and he\u2019s not a racist.\n\nHe is none of those things, because all would require Barack Obama to have a belief system, a worldview, a set of convictions about political philosophy, theology, and socioeconomics that he simply doesn\u2019t have. He is, instead, empty. He is an empty vessel.\n\nThis will shock and offend his legion of admirers on the left, as it stands in stark contrast to the breathless, leg-thrilling declarations by liberal America that Obama is a deep-thinking, complex, contemplative scholar of soaring intellect, a new kind of leader, exquisitely built for a changing world, who knows the war isn\u2019t between good and evil, but between silence and diplomacy, and for whom indecision is a mark of judicious caution.\n\nBut he\u2019d done nothing to deserve those early accolades, of course. So all of that was pre-ordained and pre-packaged, the result of a coordinated and deliberate campaign by a coalition of marketers, politicos, and members of the press to brand Barack Obama as \u201chope and change\u201d before anyone even knew what his selling points were, or if he actually had any.\n\nThe proof of his ideological emptiness is practically undeniable. He has been, over the short course of his political career, the great abandoner, ever-willing to denounce those ideals that were previously sold to his constituents as \u201chis convictions.\u201d\n\nAfter 20 years in Reverend Wright\u2019s church, he simply got up and left. The man who baptized his children, who was marketed (to black voters in particular) as Obama\u2019s spiritual adviser, who was so integral in shaping Barack Obama\u2019s adult life, that he publicly denounced him, and left his church altogether. And he also denounced black liberation theology, despite giving numerous interviews about the ways in which it had helped shape his religious worldview. After initially defending Rev. Wright, suddenly he and his brand of religion were chucked out the window of a moving campaign bus. He has yet to find a replacement, unsurprisingly, but his interest in evangelicals like Rick Warren and Carey Cash means he is open to the theological polar opposite of Rev. Wright.\n\nThe same sort of dance occurred with other politically inconvenient allies, like domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, Wright apologist Father Michael Pfleger, and convicted felon Tony Rezko. Obama distanced himself from all of them and then eventually dumped them altogether when it became politically necessary. Van Jones was merely a post-election victim of Obama\u2019s willing abandonment. And there have been others.\n\nSo would a real radical disown his radical mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s? Would a real extremist and true-believer insist with a straight face that he didn\u2019t really believe all that stuff? Would a real ideologue be persuaded by a public opinion poll to abandon whole ideology?\n\nActual radicals like Wright and Ayers and Jones defend their beliefs, regardless of the pushback and potential fallout. What Obama did, in contrast, was purely political. Because, despite the insistence by the left that Obama somehow transcends politics, that\u2019s what he is \u2013 a politician. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nWe can also look at the shift in his policy positions over the past few years. He was once quoted as saying that he supported a single-payer health care system. The best political decision now, however, was to abandon that for a more docile public option. Once that failed to garner the groundswell of support his advisers thought it would, he appeared altogether indifferent to it. If he were reallya radical, he\u2019d be rallying us around universal health care right now, not some watered-down 1990-page bureaucratic hodge podge that is neither revolutionary nor practical.\n\nHis impassioned pledges to end \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d close Gitmo, bring troops home, end military tribunals, and myriad other promises, suddenly seem less like the stuff of real political conviction, and more like political headaches that require a clever exit strategy.\n\nAnd his reaction to any kind of opposition \u2013 from the right, from the citizenry, from Fox News \u2013 is equally telling. If Obama\u2019s agenda were based on conviction instead of political expedience and an unquenchable thirst for popularity, criticism would bounce right off him. Instead he seems frighteningly flappable. That\u2019s because leadership without convictions is leadership of empty rhetoric. Convictions can be defended against criticism. Empty rhetoric cannot.\n\nSo why all the radical friends and the radical proposals and the radical rhetoric if he\u2019s not himself a radical? Because his lack of conviction and his inability to forge his own philosophical and theological identity, have made him incredibly susceptible to external influence and pressure. He is easily led. He is, as such, the perfect prospect for someone like Bill Ayers or Reverend Wright, whose radical agendas require vulnerable recruits who are malleable and willing.\n\nI don\u2019t know if President Obama is a man of conviction, if he is a man of faith, or if he is the intellectual giant the left really wants him to be. He very well may be all of those things. But I haven\u2019t seen proof of any of it yet, and neither have you, because there hasn\u2019t been any.\n\nThe only thing we do know for sure, one year after anointing this relative unknown the forty-fourth president of the United States, is that he\u2019s a politician, pure and simple. Calling him a radical gives him way too much credit.\n\nS.E. Cupp is a write and co-author of \"Why You're Wrong About the Right.\" She is a frequent contributor to the Fox Forum.",

      "Text": "    Jan 20 (Reuters) - Barack Obama will be sworn in as the  44th president of the United States at noon on Tuesday.      Here are some biographical facts about the first  African-American to hold the nation's highest office.        Age: 47      Birthdate: Aug. 4, 1961      Birthplace: Honolulu, Hawaii      Education: Columbia University; Harvard Law School      Wife: Michelle Robinson Obama      Children: Daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7      Religious affiliation: United Church of Christ      Party: Democrat        Family: Barack Obama was born to a Kenyan father and a  white American mother. His father, Barack Obama Sr., married  his mother, Ann Dunham, while studying at the University of  Hawaii. The couple separated two years after Obama was born.  His father ultimately returned to Kenya, where he became a  noted economist. He died in a car accident in 1982.      Obama's mother's second marriage was to an Indonesian man  named Lolo Soetoro. The family moved to Indonesia and Obama  remained there until he was 10 when he moved back to Hawaii and  lived with his grandparents while studying on a scholarship at  the elite Punahou Academy.      He has seven half brothers and sisters in Kenya from his  father's other marriages, and a half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng,  from his mother's second marriage.        Career: After finishing college in 1983, Obama worked for a  New York financial consultancy and a consumer organization. He  landed a job in Chicago in 1985 as an organizer for Developing  Communities Project, a church-based group seeking to improve  living conditions in poor neighborhoods.      Three years later, Obama left to go to Harvard Law School,  where he became the first black president of the law review. He  worked as a summer associate at the Sidley Austin law firm in  Chicago, where he met his future wife. After graduation from  Harvard in 1991, Obama practiced civil rights law at a small  firm in Chicago, then became a lecturer in constitutional law  at the University of Chicago in 1993.        Elective office: Obama won a seat in the Illinois state  Senate in 1996. During his time in the Legislature, he worked  on welfare and ethics legislation, as well as a measure  requiring electronic recording of police interrogations and  confessions in homicide investigations.      Obama won a heavily contested U.S. Senate seat in 2004,  carrying 53 percent of the Democratic primary vote in an  eight-candidate race. He easily won the general election as  well. In the U.S. Senate he compiled a liberal voting record,  but was one of the few Democrats to back a measure on  class-action lawsuits. He opposed the appointment of Chief  Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito to the U.S.  Supreme Court.      The nonpartisan National Journal ranked him as the most  liberal member of the U.S. Senate early this year based on his  voting record in 2007. He was ranked 10th most liberal in 2006  and 16th most liberal in 2005.           Presidential campaign: Obama announced his presidential  candidacy on Feb. 10, 2007. Though New York Sen. Hillary  Clinton was initially seen as the front-runner for the  Democratic nomination, Obama quickly showed an ability to raise  large amounts of money and draw record-breaking crowds who were  attracted to his rhetorical skill, his opposition to the Iraq  war, and his promise to move beyond the divisive politics of  the past 40 years.      Obama won the first contest of the Democratic primary in  Iowa in",

      "Text": "(Refile to update headline)      Nov 5 (Reuters) - Barack Obama is the U.S. president-elect.  Following are some of his biographical details:        Age: 47      Birthdate: Aug. 4, 1961      Birthplace: Honolulu, Hawaii      Education: Columbia University; Harvard Law School      Wife: Michelle Robinson      Children: Two daughters      Religious affiliation: United Church of Christ        Family: Barack Obama was born in Hawaii to a Kenyan father  and a white American mother. His father, Barack Obama Sr.,  married his mother, Ann Dunham, while studying at the  University of Hawaii. The couple separated two years after  Obama was born. His father ultimately returned to Kenya, where  he became a noted economist. He died in a car accident in 1982.      Obama's mother's second marriage was to an Indonesian man  named Lolo Soetoro. The family moved to Indonesia and Obama  remained there until he was 10 when he moved back to Hawaii and  lived with his grandparents while studying on a scholarship at  the elite Punahou Academy.      He has seven half brothers and sisters in Kenya from his  father's other marriages, and a half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng,  from his mother's second marriage.        Career: After finishing college in 1983, Obama worked for a  New York financial consultant and a consumer organization. He  landed a job in Chicago in 1985 as an organizer for Developing  Communities Project, a church-based group seeking to improve  living conditions in poor neighborhoods.      Three years later, Obama left to go to Harvard Law School,  where he became the first black president of the law review. He  worked as a summer associate at the Sidley Austin law firm in  Chicago, where he met his future wife. After graduation from  Harvard in 1991, Obama practiced civil rights law at a small  firm in Chicago, then became a lecturer in constitutional law  at the University of Chicago in 1993.        Elective office: Obama won a seat in the Illinois state  Senate in 1996. During his time in the legislature, he worked  on welfare and ethics legislation, as well as a measure  requiring electronic recording of police interrogations and  confessions in homicide investigations.      Obama won a heavily contested U.S. Senate seat in 2004,  carrying 53 percent of the Democratic primary vote in an  eight-candidate race. He easily won the general election. In  the Senate he compiled a liberal voting record, but was one of  the few Democrats to back a measure on class-action lawsuits.  He opposed the appointment of Chief Justice John Roberts and  Justice Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court.      The nonpartisan National Journal ranked him as the most  liberal member of the Senate early this year based on his  voting record in 2007. He was ranked 10th most liberal in 2006  and 16th most liberal in 2005.

      "Text": "    By Sue Zeidler      LOS ANGELES, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Sarah Palin represents  many things Hollywood liberals love to hate, from her  opposition to gay marriage to her support for gun rights, yet  she possesses two key qualities they admire -- star appeal and  a great script.      Accordingly, Hollywood Republicans -- often overshadowed by  their left-leaning peers -- are seeking to capitalize on the  celebrity of John McCain's running mate in the Nov. 4 election  to generate support in a town well-known for its lavish  Democratic fund-raisers and events.      'She's certainly got star appeal and is the kind of  candidate that is made for Hollywood. I offered to throw her a  fundraiser myself,' said MGM chief Harry Sloan, one of  Hollywood's most vocal Republicans.      Palin has shaken up the White House race, boosted  enthusiasm among previously apathetic supporters of McCain's  presidential nomination and drawn support from women, rural  voters and Southerners, according to recent polls.      Sloan said there were no plans for a Palin Hollywood  fundraiser yet as her campaign managers were inundated with  similar requests from all over the country after her national  debut at the Republican National Convention on Sept. 3.      A campaign spokesman would not disclose McCain and Palin's  movements beyond one week's time, but various Hollywood  executives said they heard the Arizona senator and Alaska  governor would be swinging through California later this month  or early next month.      Democratic candidates have long enjoyed a fundraising  advantage in Hollywood. Through the end of July, Democratic  presidential nominee Barack Obama raised $5.2 million from the  entertainment industry, compared with McCain's $885,000,  according to the Center for Responsive Politics.      'It's like 10 to 1 here in terms of performing artists who  support Obama versus McCain. There are a significant group of  Republican supporters in Hollywood, but they're just not as  outspoken,' said political analyst Allan Hoffenblum.        PERSONAL STORY      Hollywood is aligning again for Obama on Sept. 16 when  Barbra Streisand will sing at a Beverly Hills event expected to  raise as much as $9 million.      While some Hollywood political watchers see Palin helping  to mobilize greater celebrity support around Obama, they said  filmmakers, producers and other entertainment executives were  fascinated by the personal story of McCain's running mate,  including her 'hockey mom' persona and passion for hunting.      'These people are interested in drama, and Sarah Palin, a  pistol-packing mother of five, is clearly an interesting  character. Politically, they may not agree with Sarah Palin but  they are intrigued,' said Joel Fox, a political analyst.      Long-time Democrat Dan Glickman, chairman of the Motion  Picture Association of America, attended the Republican  National Convention. 'It's important to show our organization  has allies in both camps. Our issues are bi-partisan,' said  Glickman.      'The question is does she become a bigger draw than McCain?  It's too early to draw any conclusions,' he said.      Palin's arrival is encouraging to Hollywood conservatives  like Robert Davi, who stars in director David Zucker's upcoming  'An American Carol,' a spoof about a liberal filmmaker who  wanted to abolish the July 4 Independence Day holiday.      'A lot of times, conservative guys on the set feel  intimidated and unable to speak their view,' said Da",

The plan would include an immediate $250 tax credit to workers  that could double if the economy worsens; a one-time $250  supplement to Social Security retirement payments, a $10 billion  fund to help homeowners facing foreclosure, and a $10 billion fund  to bolster states facing budget shortfalls.

      "Text": "    Jan 3 (Reuters) - Barack Obama won the Democratic nominating  contest in Iowa on Thursday, a major step in his bid to beat rival  Hillary Clinton and become their party's presidential pick for the  November general election.      Here are five facts about the Illinois Senator who aims to  become the first black president of the United States:           *Obama's father was born and raised in a village in Kenya; his  mother, who was white, grew up in Kansas.           *Obama grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia. He earned his law  degree from Harvard in 1991 and was the first African-American  president of the Harvard Law Review.           *He is married to wife Michelle and has two young  daughters.           *He was a member of the Illinois State Senate before being  elected to the U.S. Senate. His speech at the Democratic  National Convention in 2004 earned him national attention and  acclaim.           *On issues key to many Democratic voters, Obama favors  withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq, reducing carbon emissions to  fight climate change, and eliminating tax breaks from companies  that move jobs overseas.

      "Text": "Tension is rising between India and Pakistan because it looks like the killers who attacked Mumbai were based inside Pakistani territory. If shooting breaks out between these two countries, the world will have yet another crisis created by Muslim terrorists.\n\nIt is obvious to sane people that the American intelligence agencies must continue to stay ahead of the terror-killers and disrupt plots like Mumbai should they be directed here. To do that, information from captured terror suspects becomes vital.\n\nBut President-elect Obama has committed himself to an undefined no torture policy and is also having some difficulty finding someone to head up the CIA. Former CIA Chief of Staff John Brennan has taken himself out of the running because some far-left loons criticized him for taking an aggressive anti-terror stance after 9/11.\n\nThis is very disturbing. The far-left wants the CIA to go by the Army Field Manual when interrogating suspects. If that happens, all of us will be in danger.\n\nWhy? Well, here's what the manual says: \"Prisoners of war who refuse to answer (questions) may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.\"\n\nNow \u2014 and this is important \u2014 that is fine for the military. It is not their job to break down terror suspects. It's their job to kill or capture them on the battlefield. The CIA should interrogate high-value targets.\n\nBut if Obama orders the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies not to employ any tough interrogation methods, trust me, many people will die. The terrorists are not going to stop, and only very aggressive action against them has kept us safe since 9/11.\n\nBut these far-left loons, these despicable people who blame America for worldwide terrorism, now have far more power in this country than they did just one month ago.\n\nI believe Barack Obama understands the danger the Muslim terrorists pose to the world. I believe Mr. Obama will not destroy the CIA's ability to break down terror suspects. He has to know that hardcore terrorists are not going to give up information easily.\n\nBut still some people don't get it, and these people are foolish and dangerous, so crazed by their far-left ideology they'd allow innocent people to die for it.\n\nThe USA should never torture, but coerced interrogation at the direction of the president is vital when lives are on the line. Of course, the loons will never acknowledge that. They don't want to do anything \"unpleasant\" to terror suspects.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nAs you may know, actor Patrick Swayze is waging a valiant fight against pancreatic cancer. The 56-year-old actor is working on a new TV show and generally fighting the good fight.\n\nBut a number of tabloids continue to sound the death knell for him, and Mr. Swayze would like them to knock it off. We hope they do, because the man is brave and a patriot.\n\nOn the pinhead front, you make the call on this one. At the opening of a new visitors' center at the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said this:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID, D-NEV.: My staff has always said, \"Don't say this,\" but I'm going to say it again, because it's so descriptive, because it's true.\n\nLeader Boehner mentioned that tourists lined up in the summer and winter, long lines coming into the Capitol. In the summertime, because of the high humidity and how hot it gets here, you could literally smell the tourists coming into the Capitol.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nNo matter how bad the folks smell, it doesn't compete with some of the stuff going on in the Senate.\n\nPinhead? You make the call.\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads & Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

      "Text": "    By Caren Bohan      EVANSVILLE, Ind., April 23 (Reuters) - Barack Obama's rapid  rise from relative obscurity toward winning the Democratic  Party nomination for U.S. president hit another bump when he  lost to rival Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania.      Obama's defeat on Tuesday in the state's nominating contest  slowed his momentum, but he still holds the lead in delegates  who will decide the party's nominee to run against Republican  John McCain in the November presidential election.      Just four years after he burst onto the national political  scene with a keynote speech at the Democratic Party convention,  the questions for those deciding whether to support Obama have  been mostly about his relative inexperience.      Is the 46-year-old first-term senator who would be the  first black U.S. president just a 'phenomenon' desired by a  war-weary nation eager for a fresh face or does he have what it  takes to be an effective president?      Obama cast his scant time on the national political scene  as an advantage, saying it meant his hope and ideals had not  been compromised. His rousing oratory and can-do message struck  a chord early with the public, drawing large crowds and  enthusing young voters.      Doubts over whether voters were 'ready' for a black  president diminished as he steadily chipped away at Clinton's  large early lead and eventually moved past her in the long  run-up to the presidential election.      Once the race was down to two Democratic candidates, there  was little to distinguish them on policy issues.           MULTICULTURAL AMERICA      Obama often points to his roots -- his father was Kenyan  and his mother a white woman from Kansas -- as one reason he  should be picked to run the country, saying he is   representative of multicultural America.      One of his favorite lines --- 'When you're a black guy  named Barack Obama and you're running for president you've got  to have hope' -- regularly draws laughs.      But it is clear Obama has also asked serious questions  about his heritage.      A two-time bestselling author who also won two Grammy  awards for the audio version of his books, Obama chronicled his  struggles to understand himself and his race in 1995 in 'Dreams  from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance.'      He followed up the memoir in 2006 with 'The Audacity of  Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream' outlining his  political principles.      While attracting wide support among African Americans,  Obama eschewed the rhetoric of race struggle and structured his  campaign to appeal to all races.      He has also described himself as a 'blank screen' on which  people of all different political leanings can project their  own views.        CLOSER SCRUTINY      As he moved ahead in the polls and the race for delegates  who pick the party nominee, Democratic and Republican opponents  took a closer look at his record and associates.      Video of Jeremiah Wright, his black pastor at the Trinity  United Church of Christ in Chicago, giving racially and  politically charged sermons, including saying U.S. policies  were partially responsible for Sept. 11 attacks, surfaced on  the Internet in March.      Obama, who borrowed the words 'audacity of hope' from  Wright, was forced to disavow his pastor and ended up giving a  much-praised speech on race in America.      Suddenly, every word and action was under a microscope.  Comments to a closed-door fund-raiser earlier this month sayi",

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nWatch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET and listen to the \"Radio Factor!\"\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM, GUEST HOST: In the \"Personal Story\" segment tonight: According to a report in the L.A. Times, some gay rights supporters in Hollywood may be starting a blacklist against people who supported traditional marriage by giving money to Prop 8 advocates.\n\nJoining us now from Los Angeles is Andrew Breitbart, publisher of Breitbart.com, and one of a handful of conservatives who are brave enough to speak out in Hollywood. Andrew, great to see you.\n\nClick here to watch the segment.\n\nANDREW BREITBART, BREITBART.COM: Hey, Laura. How are you?\n\nINGRAHAM: I remember when George Clooney was telling us that, you know, the biggest threat to mankind, you know, a few decades back was the blacklisting in Hollywood of people who dared to question authority. And so is this actually happening now on the other side of the political fence?\n\nBREITBART: Well, this is a more conspicuous form of blacklisting. It happens for conservatives every single day in Hollywood. This FEC search mechanism is a way that the left, the activist left, not specifically gay groups, because there are a lot of gay people who are against gay marriage. There are a lot of people who think that it should be up for debate.\n\nBut this is the same group of people back in the 1980s, Michelangelo Signorile, who started OutWeek magazine, who started to out people who were actually gay who didn't agree with the activist left agenda for the gay community. So what's happening right now is those schoolyard bullies are back, playing a bigger game on a bigger playground.\n\nINGRAHAM: Right.\n\nBREITBART: Yes.\n\nINGRAHAM: What are they actually doing? What's being done to people who have given to Prop 8? Because I know the San Francisco Chronicle is allowing people who go to their Web site to find out who gave to what Prop 8 groups.\n\nBREITBART: It's there. That's exactly what they are doing. Scott Eckern, who is the musical \u2014 the director of the California Musical Theater, had his name initially exposed, and he had to step down. To me that's an effective blacklist.\n\nEl Coyote restaurant in Los Angeles, the floor manager, not the owner but the floor manager, gave $100. And people started to protest El Coyote restaurant. So it's not just about blacklisting. It's blacklisting entire institutions if somebody is associated with it.\n\nMy father-in-law, who was blacklisted in the 1950s for being a communist, is a Christian now, believes in the sanctity of marriage, of the definition between a man and a woman, and they are protesting his theater in Venice, California.\n\nINGRAHAM: So right now there clearly is no real free speech in Hollywood. There's no political free speech. If major Hollywood executives don't speak out against this intimidation, they have no credibility. I don't want to see another movie about the blacklist of the 1940s and '50s. I don't want to see it again coming out of Hollywood. They have no credibility with me. None.\n\nBREITBART: Well, what's so important about this issue right now is that George Clooney is silent, and secondly, President-elect Barack Obama is against gay marriage. Joe Biden, Vice President-elect Joe Biden is against gay marriage. So were Bill and Hillary Clinton when they implemented don't ask, don't tell and the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\nWhat they have done specifically is isolate conservative groups, the Mormon Church, which is safe. I asked Michelangelo Signorile to go down to a local mosque with a group of angry activist left people and to protest the Islamic position on gay marriage. He won't do that.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nBREITBART: And he won't go after President-elect Barack Obama. President-elect Barack Obama has an aggressive attitude towards gay rights in this country, and they allow for him to get away with it.\n\nINGRAHAM: Well, Andrew, that is such a great point about the mosque. I mean, that would show true courage, OK? Go after the black churches and the mosques, and we'll see whether they're actually going to put their money where their mouths are.\n\nAndrew, thanks a lot.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2008 FOX News Network, LLC.

      "Text": "  - Bernd Debusmann is a Reuters columnist. The opinions  expressed are his own -      By Bernd Debusmann      WASHINGTON, June 18 (Reuters) - Barack Obama has won the  endorsement of the Ku Klux Klan in his bid to become the first  black president of the United States. His campaign is financed  by Hugo Chavez, the vocally anti-American leader of Venezuela.  Obama is a Muslim. And possibly, he is the anti-Christ.      So say e-mails circulating on the Internet, whose  importance as a marketplace for the exchange of unverified  information, sometimes outlandish ideas and often toxic rumors  has exploded over the last decade. It is now playing a key role  in American politics. According to a new study, almost half of  all Americans use the Internet to follow the presidential  election campaign.      Now Obama, who already made political history by becoming  the first black American to win the Democratic party's  presidential nomination, is making Internet history with a Web  site specifically set up to counter rumors about him and his  wife Michelle. It is a break with the conventional wisdom that  it is counter-productive to respond to rumor and innuendo in  the parallel world of cyberspace. Doing so, the thinking goes,  gives a rumor an air of legitimacy.      The novel Web site, fightthesmears.com, does not deal with  each and every online 'discovery' about Obama. A Ku Klux Klan  endorsement, Chavez financing, and anti-Christ suspicions are  too bizarre to rate a mention.  E-mails on these subjects were  collated by snopes.com, a Web site that features the '25  Hottest Urban Legends, currently circulating most widely.'  Obama e-mails rank No. 2 on the latest list, after e-mails on a  computer virus embedded in greeting cards.      To satisfy the curious: the Ku Klux Klan story originated  as a spoof in the satirical British publication Daily Squib and  gained currency because, as snopes.com put it, 'effective  satire hews closely to what people are inclined to believe.'   Well ... perhaps people on the lunatic fringe. The spoof quoted  a clan leader as saying that 'anything is better than Hillary  Clinton,' the New York senator who lost the primaries to  Obama.      Obama's counter-rumor Web site addresses one of the most  widely circulated, and most widely believed, assertions about  the candidate: that he is Muslim, attended a radical madrassa  (Islamic religious school) and was sworn into the U.S. Senate  using the Koran. The Obama-is-a-Muslim theme has been so  persistent that 10 percent of American voters are convinced he  is, according to a poll in March by the Pew Research Center        WIFE IS TARGET      The rumor that prompted Obama to set up the site last week  involved his wife Michelle. Right-wing bloggers spoke of the  existence of a videotape that showed her making an angry speech  featuring the word 'whitey,' a derogatory term for white  people.  'No such tape exists,' says the anti-rumor site,  'Michelle has not used that word.'      To disprove the notion that Obama was born outside the  United States and therefore ineligible to be president, the Web  site features a facsimile of his birth certificate, issued by  the Department of Health in Honolulu and dated August 8, 1961.  (Hawaii became a state in 1959).      The Internet, being an equal opportunity debating forum,  was alive with arguments earlier in the year over the  eligibility to the highest office in the land of John McCain,  Obama's Republican rival who was",

      "Text": " (Adds details, quote)      LAS VEGAS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Amid growing worries about a  worsening of the U.S. economy, Democratic presidential  candidate Barack Obama proposed a $75 billion economic stimulus  plan on Sunday that includes worker tax credits, a one-time  pension supplement and help to homeowners facing foreclosure.      The plan would include an immediate $250 tax credit to  workers that could double if the economy worsens, a one-time  $250 supplement to Social Security payments, a $10 billion fund  to help homeowners facing foreclosure and a $10 billion fund to  bolster states facing budget shortfalls amid lower tax  revenues.      'We need that middle-class tax cut now more than ever --  not five months from now or five weeks from now, but now,'  Obama said in a statement. 'I'm announcing a plan to jump-start  the economy by putting money in the pockets of those who need  it most and will spend it quickly.'      The Illinois senator's office unveiled the proposals at the  start of a day of campaigning in Nevada, which holds the next  contested Democratic primary on Saturday.      His leading rival, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, on Friday  unveiled an economic stimulus package she said would be worth  $70 billion. Her plan placed more of an emphasis on helping  families unable to make mortgage payments -- a major issue in  Nevada where 'for sale' signs are common on homes across Las  Vegas, its major city.      The plan also includes a $10 billion extension of  unemployment insurance to help those who have been unable to  find a job for more than half a year.      Last year, the senator proposed tax credits of up to $500  for 150 million workers. His revised economic plan calls for  $250 of that to come in an immediate credit, and the rest as  soon as three months later if the nation's unemployment rate  worsens.

      "Text": "    * Obama meets Prime Minister Maliki      * Wants U.S. combat troops out in 16 months if wins election      * Maliki has suggested setting withdrawal timetable            By Dean Yates and Wisam Mohammed      BAGHDAD, July 21 (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential  candidate Barack Obama met Iraq's prime minister on Monday to  get a first-hand assessment of security in the country, where  violence is at its lowest level since early 2004.      His visit thrusts U.S. strategy in Iraq and troop levels to  the centre of the November election race between the first-term  senator from Illinois and Republican candidate John McCain.  There are more than 140,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq.      Obama has called for the removal of U.S. combat troops  within 16 months of taking office should he win the election.      Iraqiya state television and witnesses said Obama met Prime  Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad. There were no further  details on Obama's visit, which has been shrouded in secrecy for  security reasons.      Obama visited Afghanistan over the weekend, the other big  foreign policy challenge the next American president will face.  He called the situation in Afghanistan 'precarious and urgent'  and said Washington should start planning to transfer more  troops there from Iraq.      Maliki suggested earlier this month setting a timetable for  U.S. troops to leave Iraq but has given no dates.      Obama has welcomed Maliki's suggestion but some Iraqis  insist that the army and police cannot go it alone and that a  premature withdrawal of U.S. troops could open the door to the  sort of violence that nearly tore Iraq apart not so long ago.      On Sunday the Iraqi government denied Maliki told a German  magazine in an interview that he backed Obama's plan to withdraw  combat troops within 16 months. The government said Maliki's  remarks to Der Spiegel were translated incorrectly.       McCain has attacked Obama for not visiting Iraq recently to  get a first-hand look at conditions.      The Republican candidate has been to Iraq eight times while  Obama's only other trip was in January 2006, a month before  militants blew up a revered Shi'ite shrine in Samarra in an  attack that plunged Iraq into vicious sectarian fighting.      The U.S. embassy said Obama, who is visiting Iraq as part of  a U.S. congressional delegation, would also meet U.S. military  commanders and American troops.      Commanders are likely to tell Obama that security gains are  fragile and could be jeopardised by a hasty troop withdrawal.      Obama, trying to boost his foreign policy credentials, will  travel to other countries in the Middle East and visit major  powers in Europe this week.      He has scheduled no news conferences in Iraq.            OBAMA SAYS WANTS TO END THE WAR      Obama courted controversy on July 3 when he said he might  'refine' his views on withdrawing combat troops from Iraq within  16 months but later said his stance had been unchanged for more  than a year and that he intended 'to end this war'.      McCain says the U.S. troop buildup last year helped boost  stability in Iraq and has criticised the Democrat's vow to order  a quick withdrawal as 'reckless'.      But the dramatic reduction in violence has led Baghdad to  become increasingly assertive about its own security  capabilities.      Indeed, Maliki and President George W. Bush agreed last week  to set a 'time horizon' for reducing American forces in Iraq.      It was the closest the",

      "Text": "A year after electing Barack Obama president, and five years after his star turn at the Democratic National Convention, we are still trying to figure him out.\n\nIs he a left-wing radical or is he a crowd-pleasing moderate? Is he a uniter? Is he actually religious? Is he a socialist? Does he hate America? And, in light of the confidence he projects, why can\u2019t he seem to take criticism?\n\nBut we could, of course, write that first sentence another way: Only a year after electing Barack Obama president, and we are already trying to figure him out.\n\nRather than it being kind of late to attempt a rigorous analysis of President Obama\u2019s psyche, his political philosophy and his managerial style, perhaps it\u2019s a little too soon. Presidential personalities, after all, develop over time. And the famous saying is true that great leaders aren\u2019t born, but made.\n\nNonetheless, because I\u2019m too young for caution, and too old for fear, I\u2019m more than happy to take a stab at it.\n\nLet me first assuage the fears of many of my conservative friends and colleagues: Barack Obama is not a left-wing radical. He is not a socialist, a communist or a Marxist, and he\u2019s not a black liberation theologist. He\u2019s not un-American, he\u2019s not an atheist, and he\u2019s not a racist.\n\nHe is none of those things, because all would require Barack Obama to have a belief system, a worldview, a set of convictions about political philosophy, theology, and socioeconomics that he simply doesn\u2019t have. He is, instead, empty. He is an empty vessel.\n\nThis will shock and offend his legion of admirers on the left, as it stands in stark contrast to the breathless, leg-thrilling declarations by liberal America that Obama is a deep-thinking, complex, contemplative scholar of soaring intellect, a new kind of leader, exquisitely built for a changing world, who knows the war isn\u2019t between good and evil, but between silence and diplomacy, and for whom indecision is a mark of judicious caution.\n\nBut he\u2019d done nothing to deserve those early accolades, of course. So all of that was pre-ordained and pre-packaged, the result of a coordinated and deliberate campaign by a coalition of marketers, politicos, and members of the press to brand Barack Obama as \u201chope and change\u201d before anyone even knew what his selling points were, or if he actually had any.\n\nThe proof of his ideological emptiness is practically undeniable. He has been, over the short course of his political career, the great abandoner, ever-willing to denounce those ideals that were previously sold to his constituents as \u201chis convictions.\u201d\n\nAfter 20 years in Reverend Wright\u2019s church, he simply got up and left. The man who baptized his children, who was marketed (to black voters in particular) as Obama\u2019s spiritual adviser, who was so integral in shaping Barack Obama\u2019s adult life, that he publicly denounced him, and left his church altogether. And he also denounced black liberation theology, despite giving numerous interviews about the ways in which it had helped shape his religious worldview. After initially defending Rev. Wright, suddenly he and his brand of religion were chucked out the window of a moving campaign bus. He has yet to find a replacement, unsurprisingly, but his interest in evangelicals like Rick Warren and Carey Cash means he is open to the theological polar opposite of Rev. Wright.\n\nThe same sort of dance occurred with other politically inconvenient allies, like domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, Wright apologist Father Michael Pfleger, and convicted felon Tony Rezko. Obama distanced himself from all of them and then eventually dumped them altogether when it became politically necessary. Van Jones was merely a post-election victim of Obama\u2019s willing abandonment. And there have been others.\n\nSo would a real radical disown his radical mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s? Would a real extremist and true-believer insist with a straight face that he didn\u2019t really believe all that stuff? Would a real ideologue be persuaded by a public opinion poll to abandon whole ideology?\n\nActual radicals like Wright and Ayers and Jones defend their beliefs, regardless of the pushback and potential fallout. What Obama did, in contrast, was purely political. Because, despite the insistence by the left that Obama somehow transcends politics, that\u2019s what he is \u2013 a politician. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nWe can also look at the shift in his policy positions over the past few years. He was once quoted as saying that he supported a single-payer health care system. The best political decision now, however, was to abandon that for a more docile public option. Once that failed to garner the groundswell of support his advisers thought it would, he appeared altogether indifferent to it. If he were reallya radical, he\u2019d be rallying us around universal health care right now, not some watered-down 1990-page bureaucratic hodge podge that is neither revolutionary nor practical.\n\nHis impassioned pledges to end \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d close Gitmo, bring troops home, end military tribunals, and myriad other promises, suddenly seem less like the stuff of real political conviction, and more like political headaches that require a clever exit strategy.\n\nAnd his reaction to any kind of opposition \u2013 from the right, from the citizenry, from Fox News \u2013 is equally telling. If Obama\u2019s agenda were based on conviction instead of political expedience and an unquenchable thirst for popularity, criticism would bounce right off him. Instead he seems frighteningly flappable. That\u2019s because leadership without convictions is leadership of empty rhetoric. Convictions can be defended against criticism. Empty rhetoric cannot.\n\nSo why all the radical friends and the radical proposals and the radical rhetoric if he\u2019s not himself a radical? Because his lack of conviction and his inability to forge his own philosophical and theological identity, have made him incredibly susceptible to external influence and pressure. He is easily led. He is, as such, the perfect prospect for someone like Bill Ayers or Reverend Wright, whose radical agendas require vulnerable recruits who are malleable and willing.\n\nI don\u2019t know if President Obama is a man of conviction, if he is a man of faith, or if he is the intellectual giant the left really wants him to be. He very well may be all of those things. But I haven\u2019t seen proof of any of it yet, and neither have you, because there hasn\u2019t been any.\n\nThe only thing we do know for sure, one year after anointing this relative unknown the forty-fourth president of the United States, is that he\u2019s a politician, pure and simple. Calling him a radical gives him way too much credit.\n\nS.E. Cupp is a write and co-author of \"Why You're Wrong About the Right.\" She is a frequent contributor to the Fox Forum.",

Here are some biographical facts about the first  African-American to hold the nation's highest office.        Age: 47      Birthdate: Aug. 4, 1961      Birthplace: Honolulu, Hawaii      Education: Columbia University; Harvard Law School      Wife: Michelle Robinson Obama      Children: Daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7      Religious affiliation: United Church of Christ      Party: Democrat        Family: Barack Obama was born to a Kenyan father and a  white American mother. His father, Barack Obama Sr., married  his mother, Ann Dunham, while studying at the University of  Hawaii. The couple separated two years after Obama was born.  His father ultimately returned to Kenya, where he became a  noted economist. He died in a car accident in 1982.      Obama's mother's second marriage was to an Indonesian man  named Lolo Soetoro. The family moved to Indonesia and Obama  remained there until he was 10 when he moved back to Hawaii and  lived with his grandparents while studying on a scholarship at  the elite Punahou Academy.      He has seven half brothers and sisters in Kenya from his  father's other marriages, and a half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng,  from his mother's second marriage.        Career: After finishing college in 1983, Obama worked for a  New York financial consultancy and a consumer organization. He  landed a job in Chicago in 1985 as an organizer for Developing  Communities Project, a church-based group seeking to improve  living conditions in poor neighborhoods.      Three years later, Obama left to go to Harvard Law School,  where he became the first black president of the law review. He  worked as a summer associate at the Sidley Austin law firm in  Chicago, where he met his future wife. After graduation from  Harvard in 1991, Obama practiced civil rights law at a small  firm in Chicago, then became a lecturer in constitutional law  at the University of Chicago in 1993.        Elective office: Obama won a seat in the Illinois state  Senate in 1996. During his time in the Legislature, he worked  on welfare and ethics legislation, as well as a measure  requiring electronic recording of police interrogations and  confessions in homicide investigations.      Obama won a heavily contested U.S. Senate seat in 2004,  carrying 53 percent of the Democratic primary vote in an  eight-candidate race. He easily won the general election as  well. In the U.S. Senate he compiled a liberal voting record,  but was one of the few Democrats to back a measure on  class-action lawsuits. He opposed the appointment of Chief  Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito to the U.S.  Supreme Court.      The nonpartisan National Journal ranked him as the most  liberal member of the U.S. Senate early this year based on his  voting record in 2007. He was ranked 10th most liberal in 2006  and 16th most liberal in 2005.           Presidential campaign: Obama announced his presidential  candidacy on Feb. 10, 2007. Though New York Sen. Hillary  Clinton was initially seen as the front-runner for the  Democratic nomination, Obama quickly showed an ability to raise  large amounts of money and draw record-breaking crowds who were  attracted to his rhetorical skill, his opposition to the Iraq  war, and his promise to move beyond the divisive politics of  the past 40 years.      Obama won the first contest of the Democratic primary in  Iowa in",

      "Text": "Tension is rising between India and Pakistan because it looks like the killers who attacked Mumbai were based inside Pakistani territory. If shooting breaks out between these two countries, the world will have yet another crisis created by Muslim terrorists.\n\nIt is obvious to sane people that the American intelligence agencies must continue to stay ahead of the terror-killers and disrupt plots like Mumbai should they be directed here. To do that, information from captured terror suspects becomes vital.\n\nBut President-elect Obama has committed himself to an undefined no torture policy and is also having some difficulty finding someone to head up the CIA. Former CIA Chief of Staff John Brennan has taken himself out of the running because some far-left loons criticized him for taking an aggressive anti-terror stance after 9/11.\n\nThis is very disturbing. The far-left wants the CIA to go by the Army Field Manual when interrogating suspects. If that happens, all of us will be in danger.\n\nWhy? Well, here's what the manual says: \"Prisoners of war who refuse to answer (questions) may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.\"\n\nNow \u2014 and this is important \u2014 that is fine for the military. It is not their job to break down terror suspects. It's their job to kill or capture them on the battlefield. The CIA should interrogate high-value targets.\n\nBut if Obama orders the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies not to employ any tough interrogation methods, trust me, many people will die. The terrorists are not going to stop, and only very aggressive action against them has kept us safe since 9/11.\n\nBut these far-left loons, these despicable people who blame America for worldwide terrorism, now have far more power in this country than they did just one month ago.\n\nI believe Barack Obama understands the danger the Muslim terrorists pose to the world. I believe Mr. Obama will not destroy the CIA's ability to break down terror suspects. He has to know that hardcore terrorists are not going to give up information easily.\n\nBut still some people don't get it, and these people are foolish and dangerous, so crazed by their far-left ideology they'd allow innocent people to die for it.\n\nThe USA should never torture, but coerced interrogation at the direction of the president is vital when lives are on the line. Of course, the loons will never acknowledge that. They don't want to do anything \"unpleasant\" to terror suspects.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nAs you may know, actor Patrick Swayze is waging a valiant fight against pancreatic cancer. The 56-year-old actor is working on a new TV show and generally fighting the good fight.\n\nBut a number of tabloids continue to sound the death knell for him, and Mr. Swayze would like them to knock it off. We hope they do, because the man is brave and a patriot.\n\nOn the pinhead front, you make the call on this one. At the opening of a new visitors' center at the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said this:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID, D-NEV.: My staff has always said, \"Don't say this,\" but I'm going to say it again, because it's so descriptive, because it's true.\n\nLeader Boehner mentioned that tourists lined up in the summer and winter, long lines coming into the Capitol. In the summertime, because of the high humidity and how hot it gets here, you could literally smell the tourists coming into the Capitol.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nNo matter how bad the folks smell, it doesn't compete with some of the stuff going on in the Senate.\n\nPinhead? You make the call.\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads & Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

      "Text": "    By Caren Bohan      EVANSVILLE, Ind., April 23 (Reuters) - Barack Obama's rapid  rise from relative obscurity toward winning the Democratic  Party nomination for U.S. president hit another bump when he  lost to rival Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania.      Obama's defeat on Tuesday in the state's nominating contest  slowed his momentum, but he still holds the lead in delegates  who will decide the party's nominee to run against Republican  John McCain in the November presidential election.      Just four years after he burst onto the national political  scene with a keynote speech at the Democratic Party convention,  the questions for those deciding whether to support Obama have  been mostly about his relative inexperience.      Is the 46-year-old first-term senator who would be the  first black U.S. president just a 'phenomenon' desired by a  war-weary nation eager for a fresh face or does he have what it  takes to be an effective president?      Obama cast his scant time on the national political scene  as an advantage, saying it meant his hope and ideals had not  been compromised. His rousing oratory and can-do message struck  a chord early with the public, drawing large crowds and  enthusing young voters.      Doubts over whether voters were 'ready' for a black  president diminished as he steadily chipped away at Clinton's  large early lead and eventually moved past her in the long  run-up to the presidential election.      Once the race was down to two Democratic candidates, there  was little to distinguish them on policy issues.           MULTICULTURAL AMERICA      Obama often points to his roots -- his father was Kenyan  and his mother a white woman from Kansas -- as one reason he  should be picked to run the country, saying he is   representative of multicultural America.      One of his favorite lines --- 'When you're a black guy  named Barack Obama and you're running for president you've got  to have hope' -- regularly draws laughs.      But it is clear Obama has also asked serious questions  about his heritage.      A two-time bestselling author who also won two Grammy  awards for the audio version of his books, Obama chronicled his  struggles to understand himself and his race in 1995 in 'Dreams  from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance.'      He followed up the memoir in 2006 with 'The Audacity of  Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream' outlining his  political principles.      While attracting wide support among African Americans,  Obama eschewed the rhetoric of race struggle and structured his  campaign to appeal to all races.      He has also described himself as a 'blank screen' on which  people of all different political leanings can project their  own views.        CLOSER SCRUTINY      As he moved ahead in the polls and the race for delegates  who pick the party nominee, Democratic and Republican opponents  took a closer look at his record and associates.      Video of Jeremiah Wright, his black pastor at the Trinity  United Church of Christ in Chicago, giving racially and  politically charged sermons, including saying U.S. policies  were partially responsible for Sept. 11 attacks, surfaced on  the Internet in March.      Obama, who borrowed the words 'audacity of hope' from  Wright, was forced to disavow his pastor and ended up giving a  much-praised speech on race in America.      Suddenly, every word and action was under a microscope.  Comments to a closed-door fund-raiser earlier this month sayi",

The plan would include an immediate $250 tax credit to workers  that could double if the economy worsens; a one-time $250  supplement to Social Security retirement payments, a $10 billion  fund to help homeowners facing foreclosure, and a $10 billion fund  to bolster states facing budget shortfalls.      The Illinois senator's office unveiled the proposals while  campaigning in Nevada, which holds the next contested Democratic  primary on Saturday. His leading rival, New York Sen. Hillary  Clinton, also recently unveiled an economic stimulus package.

      "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Barack Obama was voted the  most influential man of 2008 in an online poll released on  Tuesday that asked men to decide who most impacted the way they  behave, buy and think.      The U.S. Democratic presidential candidate was ranked No.1  by readers on the AskMen.com lifestyle Web site, beating Apple  chief executive Steve Jobs and Olympic swimming champion  Michael Phelps, who landed in the No. 2 and No. 3 spots,  respectively.      Republican presidential candidate John McCain was ranked  No. 10 on the list, which was compiled on the basis of 200,000  votes from readers of the Web site whose average age is 27-28  years-old.      Last year's winner, British soccer star David Beckham, fell  to No. 25 on the 2008 list, which asked men to go beyond  professional success and likability when picking their top 49  choices.      James Bassil, editor-in-chief of AskMen.com, said he  thought Obama's top place was not so much a political  endorsement of his candidacy as 'a reflection of the interest  the presidential race has ignited in the United States.'      Stephen Colbert, host of the satirical news show 'The  Colbert Report,' was the only other politically-minded name in  the Top 10 of the 2008 list, which was dominated by sports  stars, actors and musicians.

His visit thrusts U.S. strategy in Iraq and troop levels to  the centre of the November election race between the first-term  senator from Illinois and Republican candidate John McCain.  There are more than 140,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq.      Obama has called for the removal of U.S. combat troops  within 16 months of taking office should he win the election.      Iraqiya state television and witnesses said Obama met Prime  Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad. There were no further  details on Obama's visit, which has been shrouded in secrecy for  security reasons.      Obama visited Afghanistan over the weekend, the other big  foreign policy challenge the next American president will face.  He called the situation in Afghanistan 'precarious and urgent'  and said Washington should start planning to transfer more  troops there from Iraq.      Maliki suggested earlier this month setting a timetable for  U.S. troops to leave Iraq but has given no dates.      Obama has welcomed Maliki's suggestion but some Iraqis  insist that the army and police cannot go it alone and that a  premature withdrawal of U.S. troops could open the door to the  sort of violence that nearly tore Iraq apart not so long ago.      On Sunday the Iraqi government denied Maliki told a German  magazine in an interview that he backed Obama's plan to withdraw  combat troops within 16 months. The government said Maliki's  remarks to Der Spiegel were translated incorrectly.       McCain has attacked Obama for not visiting Iraq recently to  get a first-hand look at conditions.      The Republican candidate has been to Iraq eight times while  Obama's only other trip was in January 2006, a month before  militants blew up a revered Shi'ite shrine in Samarra in an  attack that plunged Iraq into vicious sectarian fighting.      The U.S. embassy said Obama, who is visiting Iraq as part of  a U.S. congressional delegation, would also meet U.S. military  commanders and American troops.      Commanders are likely to tell Obama that security gains are  fragile and could be jeopardised by a hasty troop withdrawal.      Obama, trying to boost his foreign policy credentials, will  travel to other countries in the Middle East and visit major  powers in Europe this week.      He has scheduled no news conferences in Iraq.            OBAMA SAYS WANTS TO END THE WAR      Obama courted controversy on July 3 when he said he might  'refine' his views on withdrawing combat troops from Iraq within  16 months but later said his stance had been unchanged for more  than a year and that he intended 'to end this war'.      McCain says the U.S. troop buildup last year helped boost  stability in Iraq and has criticised the Democrat's vow to order  a quick withdrawal as 'reckless'.      But the dramatic reduction in violence has led Baghdad to  become increasingly assertive about its own security  capabilities.      Indeed, Maliki and President George W. Bush agreed last week  to set a 'time horizon' for reducing American forces in Iraq.      It was the closest the",

Here are five facts about the Illinois Senator who aims to  become the first black president of the United States:           *Obama's father was born and raised in a village in Kenya; his  mother, who was white, grew up in Kansas.           *Obama grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia. He earned his law  degree from Harvard in 1991 and was the first African-American  president of the Harvard Law Review.           *He is married to wife Michelle and has two young  daughters.           *He was a member of the Illinois State Senate before being  elected to the U.S. Senate. His speech at the Democratic  National Convention in 2004 earned him national attention and  acclaim.           *On issues key to many Democratic voters, Obama favors  withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq, reducing carbon emissions to  fight climate change, and eliminating tax breaks from companies  that move jobs overseas.

Obama is expected to reverse a  Health and Human Services Department regulation aimed at  protecting health care and other workers who invoke their  consciences in refusing care such as contraceptive services.      * Obama is also widely expected to quickly reverse Bush's  executive order that has had the effect of limiting embryonic  stem cell research. Former Surgeon-General Dr. Richard Carmona  complained he was muzzled in attempts to speak out on stem cell  science and other issues.      * Obama also pledged to 'wield technology's wonders to  raise health care's quality and lower its cost'. In his  campaign Obama pledged to spend billions to promote and  facilitate electronic prescribing and record-keeping.      * Obama suggested funding for alternative energy. 'We will  harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and  run our factories,' he said.      * The Bush administration was slow to accept that human  activities had affected global warming. Former Environmental  Protection Agency head Christine Todd Whitman has complained  the White House interfered with her agency's work.

      "Text": "    By Caren Bohan      CHESTER, Va., Aug 21 (Reuters) - U.S. presidential  candidate Barack Obama said on Thursday he would assemble a  foreign policy team of the 'best and the brightest' and  mentioned some people who may be considered for jobs if he wins  the White House.      Former Georgia senator Sam Nunn and former U.S. diplomat  Richard Holbrooke were among the Democrats Obama said he would  turn to for advice.      The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said he  would also seek the counsel of Republicans such as Indiana Sen.  Richard Lugar and Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel.      Republican John McCain, Obama's rival in the Nov. 4  election, has emphasized his background as a Vietnam veteran  and former prisoner of war as well as years of involvement as a  senator in foreign policy to argue that he is more qualified to  serve as U.S. commander-in-chief.      McCain accuses Obama, a first-term Illinois senator, of  lacking seasoning and judgment on foreign policy matters.      At a town hall meeting in Chester, Virginia, Obama said his  early opposition to the Iraq war showed he had better judgment  than McCain, who supported it.      But he added, 'That doesn't mean that I know everything.  I've got to have good, smart advisers around me ... It's not  like I just kind of show up, you know, one day in the White  House and say, 'Alright, what's today?''      Listing those he already consults on foreign affairs, Obama  mentioned Nunn, Holbrooke and former Secretary of Defense  William Perry.      'We will have the best and brightest -- and by the way,  they don't have to be Democrats,' he said. 'There are  Republicans like Richard Lugar, the chairman of the (Senate)  Foreign Relations committee, who is one of my dearest friends  and advisers in the Senate.'      Obama also recalled his trip in July to Iraq and  Afghanistan with Hagel.      'He's a staunch Republican, but Chuck and I agree almost on  every item of foreign policy,' he said.

      "Text": "With the announcement Friday that President Obama will leave about 50,000 troops in Iraq after the bulk of U.S. forces withdraw in 2010, it is becoming clear that on foreign policy the president will govern from the center.\n\nBut it is also now certain that he is a far-left guy on domestic policy. The new budget is simply stunning. Mr. Obama wants to spend more money than at any time since World War II.\n\nPredictably, quasi-socialists like New York Times columnist Paul Krugman are delirious with joy. Here comes the nanny state, starring President Obama and Fran Drescher.\n\nAlso predictably, conservatives like Glenn Beck are outfitting caves in the mountains. The decline and fall of America is at hand.\n\n\"Talking Points\" cannot imagine any Republican senator supporting the massive budget, so it will have trouble getting passed.\n\nBut the die has been cast. President Obama is \"all in\" for a colossal change in American society. That change means the rich will support the poor. Americans who do not succeed will have their bills paid by people like me \u2014 and Barack Obama when he becomes a private citizen again.\n\nThat also means we'll have some kind of new energy in this country, but nobody knows when or what. However, there's plenty of money that will fund the mystery.\n\nAnd gazillions more dollars will flow into America's schools. What this will do, I don't know because if the kids walk around all day with iPods in their ears and rings in their noses, money simply won't matter.\n\nNow, \"Talking Points\" knows he's a mean guy. Criticizing the kids? Come on, how can I do that? Whining about paying other people's bills? That's just downright mean, is it not?\n\nWell that's how the far-left is portraying it. Listen to this new commercial from some progressive loons:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: An economy in crisis, a president determined to act, but what did Republican leaders say to President Obama's jobs and recovery plan?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did they say to 3.5 million jobs?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did they say to tax cuts for 95 percent of working Americans?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: So who are Republican leaders listening to?\n\nRUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: I want him to fail.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tell them America won't take no for an answer anymore.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nThat's what passes for debate these days on the far left: running down anyone with whom they disagree.\n\nBut as \"Talking Points\" said Thursday night, President Obama is taking an enormous gamble, one that will affect all of our lives. He has audacity, no question. But the outcome is still mostly hope.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nOnce a year the Filene's Basement department store here in New York City mounts a sale called the \"Running of the Brides.\" The ladies line up hours ahead of time to get discounts on wedding dresses, and then when the doors open the track meet begins. The excitement is generated by dresses that once cost thousands of dollars marked down to hundreds of dollars.\n\nNow this might be a stretch, but I'm making the ladies patriots because they are thrifty, and we need that in America. So there.\n\nOn the pinhead front, welcome to Will Ferrell's world. The comedian, currently starring in the hit Broadway play about President Bush, started out as the \"Senior Prince of the Winter Ball\" at University High School in Irvine, California.\n\nClick here to see the picture!\n\nNow anyone seeing this picture back then could have predicted Mr. Ferrell would achieve great success. The only mystery: in what area?\n\nPinhead? You make the call.\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads & Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

      "Text": "    By Caren Bohan      CHICAGO, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Newly-elected U.S. president  Barack Obama will face a daunting array of foreign policy  challenges, from wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the global  financial crisis to the need to shore up the country's frayed  international image.      While taxes, health care and the economy all played a role  in the campaign before Tuesday's vote, national security issues  such as the Iranian nuclear standoff and Middle East peace are  likely to remain near the top of the agenda when Obama takes  office from President George W. Bush on Jan 20.      'The mantra for the next administration has to be, 'Be  careful what you wish for because you just might get it,'' said  James Lindsay, who was a foreign policy aide to President Bill  Clinton and is now with the University of Texas, Austin.      'The new president-elect is going to have a full foreign  policy inbox and decisions to make with enormous consequences  for American security,' added Lindsay.      Foreign policy advisers say Obama, a Democrat who will  become the first black U.S. president, has an understanding of  world affairs rooted in a childhood spent partly in Indonesia  and a quest to learn about his father's Kenyan heritage.      The Illinois senator, 47, will face pressing concerns even  before he takes over from Bush, a Republican.      On Nov. 15, Bush will convene a summit in Washington to  look at the global economic crisis. While Obama is unlikely to  attend the meeting himself, it could give his economic team the  chance to meet some of the visiting foreign officials on the  sidelines of the conference.      The Obama administration will also inherit the Iraq and  Afghan wars and an intensifying effort to pursue al Qaeda  militants on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan.      Stopping Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon -- Tehran  says its nuclear program is purely for civilian purposes -- and  holding North Korea to its promise to dismantle its nuclear  weapons program are also pressing issues.           FAMILIAR NAMES, NEW APPROACHES      Obama has a number of foreign policy advisers with roots in  the Clinton administration, although he has also said he could  work with Republicans. Republican Senator Chuck Hagel and  Democratic Senator John Kerry are two names frequently  mentioned as candidates for secretary of state.      Obama, like his defeated Republican rival John McCain, has  vowed a reinvigorated effort toward Middle East peace and  promised staunch support for Israel.      Obama foreign policy adviser Mark Lippert said fighting  terrorism, dealing with militants along the Afghan-Pakistan  border and killing or capturing Osama bin Laden are top  national security priorities.      Obama has pledged to end the Iraq war and bolster the U.S.  troop presence in Afghanistan.      The ability to tackle deteriorating security in Afghanistan  and pursue militants is 'linked to the ability to make progress  on political reconciliation in Iraq and the ability to draw  down there,' Lippert said.      McCain agreed on the need for more forces in Afghanistan,  but opposed a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq, saying U.S.  troops should remain there as long as they are needed.      Obama's willingness to talk directly to U.S. adversaries  such as Iran and Syria was another major point of disagreement  during the campaign. Obama said the Bush administration's  resistance to engaging foes has limited its diplomatic options,  a posit",

The plan would include an immediate $250 tax credit to workers  that could double if the economy worsens; a one-time $250  supplement to Social Security retirement payments, a $10 billion  fund to help homeowners facing foreclosure, and a $10 billion fund  to bolster states facing budget shortfalls.      The Illinois senator's office unveiled the proposals while  campaigning in Nevada, which holds the next contested Democratic  primary on Saturday. His leading rival, New York Sen.

      "Text": " (Adds Obama's economic adviser)      By Adam Tanner      LAS VEGAS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Amid growing worries about a  worsening of the U.S. economy, Democratic presidential  candidate Barack Obama proposed a $75 billion economic stimulus  plan on Sunday that includes worker tax credits, a one-time  pension supplement and help to homeowners facing foreclosure.      The plan would include an immediate $250 tax credit for  workers, which could double if the economy worsens, a one-time  $250 supplement to Social Security payments, a $10 billion fund  to help homeowners facing foreclosure and a $10 billion fund to  assist states facing budget shortfalls amid lower tax  revenues.      'We need that middle-class tax cut now more than ever --  not five months from now or five weeks from now, but now,'  Obama said in a statement. 'I'm announcing a plan to jump-start  the economy by putting money in the pockets of those who need  it most and will spend it quickly.'      If he won his party's nomination and then the November  election, Obama would take office in January 2009.      The Illinois senator's office unveiled the proposals at the  start of a day of campaigning in Nevada, which holds the next  contested Democratic primary on Saturday.      The 'goal would be to help the U.S. economy from going into  recession,' his economic advisor Austan Goolsbee told  reporters.      Obama's leading rival, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, on  Friday unveiled an economic stimulus package she said would be  worth $70 billion. Her plan placed more of an emphasis on  helping families unable to make mortgage payments -- a major  issue in Nevada where 'for sale' signs are common on homes  around heavily populated Las Vegas.      'There are some similarities,' Goolsbee said of the two  plans. The biggest difference with Obama's plan is that 'the  absolutely most imperative thing is to get the money into the  people's hands immediately so they can spent it.'      'The stimulus does increase the deficit in the immediate  term,' the economic adviser said, adding that preventing a  recession could have 'profound' budget implications.      The Obama plan also includes a $10 billion extension of  unemployment insurance to help those who have been unable to  find a job for more than six months.      The foreclosure help plan would be aimed at 'responsible  homeowners' who live in their primary residences, Goolsbee  said. Las Vegas has been hit hard by the subprime loan crisis,  but many of those suffering bought additional houses hoping  that fast rising prices amid a prosperous local economy would  lead to easy money.      Last year, Obama proposed tax credits of up to $500 for 150  million workers. His revised economic plan calls for $250 of  that to come in an immediate credit, and the rest as soon as  three months later if the nation's unemployment rate worsens.

      "Text": "    BLUE BELL, Pa., April 21 (Reuters) - Democratic  presidential candidate Barack Obama on Monday criticized a plan  by his Republican rival Sen. John McCain to give U.S. consumers  a temporary break from the federal gasoline tax.      'I've said I think John McCain's proposal for a three-month  tax holiday is a bad idea,' Obama, an Illinois senator, told a   small forum with middle-class voters at a community college      outside Philadelphia.      Obama said that consumers would only see the price cut for  a short time before the costs 'spike right up' again. He also  said there was no guarantee that oil companies would not just  raise prices at the pump by the same amount as the tax cut.      'We're talking about 5 percent of your total cost of gas  that you suspend for three months, which might save you a few  hundred bucks that then will spike right up,' Obama said. 'Now  keep in mind that it will save you that if Exxon Mobil <XOM.N>   doesn't decide, 'we'll just tack on another 5 percent on the current cost.''      Obama added that the money from the gasoline tax is needed  for the federal highway fund.      But Obama said he did not favor an increase in the gasoline  tax.      'Now, I don't want to jack up the cost. I'm not going to  impose an additional tax on gas because consumers just can't  bear it right now,' he said.      Obama is battling Hillary Clinton for the Democratic  nomination and the right to run against McCain, the presumptive  Republican nominee in the general election in November.      McCain last week called for a summer gasoline-tax holiday  for Americans upset over high prices at the pump. The proposal  was part of a broader plan to help the ailing U.S. economy.

      "Text": "    By David Lawder      WASHINGTON, June 11 (Reuters) - Tax breaks proposed by both  presidential hopefuls John McCain and Barack Obama would  increase the U.S. national debt by trillions of dollars over 10  years, but Obama's plan would hike taxes for the wealthiest  Americans, a tax policy group said on Wednesday.      In an analysis of how the candidates' tax proposals would  affect federal revenues, the Brookings Institution and the  Urban Institute said McCain's plans would cut receipts by $3.72  trillion from 2009-2018 compared with current tax law.      Obama's plans would cut revenues by $2.73 trillion over the  same period.      Including added interest costs, McCain's plan would add  $4.5 trillion to the national debt, while Obama's would add  $3.3 trillion -- and that's before spending proposals are  considered.      'It seems really unlikely that they're going to be  balancing the budget,' said Leonard Burman, director of The Tax  Policy Center run by Brookings and the Urban Institute in  Washington, D.C.      The group sought to quantify revenue costs for the tax  break proposals articulated on the campaign trail but assumed  flat spending for each candidate based on this year's budget.      McCain has proposed extending the Bush administration's  2001 and 2003 income and capital gains tax cuts, which are due  to expire at the end of 2010. He also wants to cut the  corporate income tax rate to 25 percent, reduce estate taxes,  increase the exemption for dependents by $500 and allow  businesses to expense purchases of shorter-term equipment.      Obama, meanwhile, would retain portions of the 2001 and  2003 tax cuts that benefit low- and middle-income Americans,  while allowing rates to ratchet back up for the wealthiest  taxpayers. He is also proposing new tax credits for lower  income workers and a home mortgage tax credit for taxpayers who  do not itemize deductions.      Obama also proposes to expand the child and dependent care  tax credit and exempt seniors earning less than $50,000 from  paying federal income taxes.      The analysis assumes both candidates want to permanently  index the alternative minimum tax for inflation to keep it from  ensnaring more middle income taxpayers, at a cost of about $1.1  trillion over 10 years.      The analysis was done before Obama said he wanted to phase  out the alternative minimum tax.      The Tax Policy Center said McCain's plan would provide  effective tax cuts for Americans across the income spectrum,  with the largest percentage increase in after-tax income going  to the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans.      This group, numbering around 150,000, would see their  after-tax income rise by an average of 11.6 percent, or  $678,500, in 2012 as compared with current law that sees tax  cuts expiring at the end of 2010.      The lowest income 20 percent of taxpayers would see an  increase in after-tax income of 0.9 percent, or $101.      Obama's plan takes somewhat the opposite tack, providing  greater percentage tax benefits for lower income groups while  the wealthiest would see tax hikes.      The analysis showed that the lowest-income 20 percent of  taxpayers would see after-tax income increase by 6.2 percent,  or $698 increase, compared with current law, while the top 0.1  percent would see their after-tax incomes decline by 5.1  percent, or $301,400.      Burman said the analysis deliberately left out spending  proposals to focus on the tax side of the equation. He added",

      "Text": "A year after electing Barack Obama president, and five years after his star turn at the Democratic National Convention, we are still trying to figure him out.\n\nIs he a left-wing radical or is he a crowd-pleasing moderate? Is he a uniter? Is he actually religious? Is he a socialist? Does he hate America? And, in light of the confidence he projects, why can\u2019t he seem to take criticism?\n\nBut we could, of course, write that first sentence another way: Only a year after electing Barack Obama president, and we are already trying to figure him out.\n\nRather than it being kind of late to attempt a rigorous analysis of President Obama\u2019s psyche, his political philosophy and his managerial style, perhaps it\u2019s a little too soon. Presidential personalities, after all, develop over time. And the famous saying is true that great leaders aren\u2019t born, but made.\n\nNonetheless, because I\u2019m too young for caution, and too old for fear, I\u2019m more than happy to take a stab at it.\n\nLet me first assuage the fears of many of my conservative friends and colleagues: Barack Obama is not a left-wing radical. He is not a socialist, a communist or a Marxist, and he\u2019s not a black liberation theologist. He\u2019s not un-American, he\u2019s not an atheist, and he\u2019s not a racist.\n\nHe is none of those things, because all would require Barack Obama to have a belief system, a worldview, a set of convictions about political philosophy, theology, and socioeconomics that he simply doesn\u2019t have. He is, instead, empty. He is an empty vessel.\n\nThis will shock and offend his legion of admirers on the left, as it stands in stark contrast to the breathless, leg-thrilling declarations by liberal America that Obama is a deep-thinking, complex, contemplative scholar of soaring intellect, a new kind of leader, exquisitely built for a changing world, who knows the war isn\u2019t between good and evil, but between silence and diplomacy, and for whom indecision is a mark of judicious caution.\n\nBut he\u2019d done nothing to deserve those early accolades, of course. So all of that was pre-ordained and pre-packaged, the result of a coordinated and deliberate campaign by a coalition of marketers, politicos, and members of the press to brand Barack Obama as \u201chope and change\u201d before anyone even knew what his selling points were, or if he actually had any.\n\nThe proof of his ideological emptiness is practically undeniable. He has been, over the short course of his political career, the great abandoner, ever-willing to denounce those ideals that were previously sold to his constituents as \u201chis convictions.\u201d\n\nAfter 20 years in Reverend Wright\u2019s church, he simply got up and left. The man who baptized his children, who was marketed (to black voters in particular) as Obama\u2019s spiritual adviser, who was so integral in shaping Barack Obama\u2019s adult life, that he publicly denounced him, and left his church altogether. And he also denounced black liberation theology, despite giving numerous interviews about the ways in which it had helped shape his religious worldview. After initially defending Rev. Wright, suddenly he and his brand of religion were chucked out the window of a moving campaign bus. He has yet to find a replacement, unsurprisingly, but his interest in evangelicals like Rick Warren and Carey Cash means he is open to the theological polar opposite of Rev. Wright.\n\nThe same sort of dance occurred with other politically inconvenient allies, like domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, Wright apologist Father Michael Pfleger, and convicted felon Tony Rezko. Obama distanced himself from all of them and then eventually dumped them altogether when it became politically necessary. Van Jones was merely a post-election victim of Obama\u2019s willing abandonment. And there have been others.\n\nSo would a real radical disown his radical mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s? Would a real extremist and true-believer insist with a straight face that he didn\u2019t really believe all that stuff? Would a real ideologue be persuaded by a public opinion poll to abandon whole ideology?\n\nActual radicals like Wright and Ayers and Jones defend their beliefs, regardless of the pushback and potential fallout. What Obama did, in contrast, was purely political. Because, despite the insistence by the left that Obama somehow transcends politics, that\u2019s what he is \u2013 a politician. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nWe can also look at the shift in his policy positions over the past few years. He was once quoted as saying that he supported a single-payer health care system. The best political decision now, however, was to abandon that for a more docile public option. Once that failed to garner the groundswell of support his advisers thought it would, he appeared altogether indifferent to it. If he were reallya radical, he\u2019d be rallying us around universal health care right now, not some watered-down 1990-page bureaucratic hodge podge that is neither revolutionary nor practical.\n\nHis impassioned pledges to end \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d close Gitmo, bring troops home, end military tribunals, and myriad other promises, suddenly seem less like the stuff of real political conviction, and more like political headaches that require a clever exit strategy.\n\nAnd his reaction to any kind of opposition \u2013 from the right, from the citizenry, from Fox News \u2013 is equally telling. If Obama\u2019s agenda were based on conviction instead of political expedience and an unquenchable thirst for popularity, criticism would bounce right off him. Instead he seems frighteningly flappable. That\u2019s because leadership without convictions is leadership of empty rhetoric. Convictions can be defended against criticism. Empty rhetoric cannot.\n\nSo why all the radical friends and the radical proposals and the radical rhetoric if he\u2019s not himself a radical? Because his lack of conviction and his inability to forge his own philosophical and theological identity, have made him incredibly susceptible to external influence and pressure. He is easily led. He is, as such, the perfect prospect for someone like Bill Ayers or Reverend Wright, whose radical agendas require vulnerable recruits who are malleable and willing.\n\nI don\u2019t know if President Obama is a man of conviction, if he is a man of faith, or if he is the intellectual giant the left really wants him to be. He very well may be all of those things. But I haven\u2019t seen proof of any of it yet, and neither have you, because there hasn\u2019t been any.\n\nThe only thing we do know for sure, one year after anointing this relative unknown the forty-fourth president of the United States, is that he\u2019s a politician, pure and simple. Calling him a radical gives him way too much credit.\n\nS.E. Cupp is a write and co-author of \"Why You're Wrong About the Right.\" She is a frequent contributor to the Fox Forum.",

      "Text": "This is a rush transcript of \"Special Report With Brit Hume\" from June 10, 2008. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. JOHN MCCAIN, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Under senator Obama's tax plan, Americans of every background would he see their taxes rise \u2014 seniors, parents, small business owners, and just about everyone who has even a modest investment in the market.\n\nSEN. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What we're trying to restore balance, put some money in the pockets of working families, in the pockets of consumers. That, actually, I believe, will be good for business.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBRIT HUME, HOST: Indeed, Senator Obama says that 95 percent of the people in this country would get a tax cut under his program.\n\nSo the debate is now joined between him and McCain, at long distance so far, but we are likely to hear more of it. Some thoughts on it now from Fred Barnes, executive editor of The Weekly Standard; Mort Kondracke, executive editor of Roll Call, and the syndicated columnist, Charles Krauthammer \u2014 FOX News contributors all.\n\nSo what about this debate? It is clearly joined, it is going to be central to this campaign. Who has the high cards, whose doing better, whose argument holds more water, Fred?\n\nFRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I think McCain's does, but that doesn't mean he's winning the debate now. And so far it's a draw.\n\nI think he's going to have to deal with this claim by Obama that he would reduce income taxes, anyway for 95 percent of Americans. When you add in all the other tax increases, all the tax increases in Obama's proposal, I think that is highly unlikely, but McCain has to examine it and make the case.\n\nThe biggest problem I have, and I think most people who in favor of a strong economic rebound, is that Obama does not understand capital gains. Remember when he was asked about the capital gains tax rate in that debate by Charlie Gibson on ABC?\n\nHe was at sea when Gibson said, look, when you raise the rate on capital gains in recent years, it has reduced the revenues that have come in, and when you reduce the rate, as happened in the Clinton administration, you get more revenue.\n\nThat seemed to be a revelation to Obama who then said that at one point, well, maybe we have to raise it because of fairness. It would be harmful to the economy if you raise the capital gains rate, but he would do it for fairness and hurt the economy and jobs, and so on? I think that's where McCain particularly has a vulnerability and he needs to seize it.\n\nHUME: Has a vulnerability in Obama?\n\nBARNES: Yes.\n\nMORT KONDRACKE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ROLL CALL: All of that's true. Obama said he's not a tax and spend liberal, but he is. I mean, he does want to spend an awful lot of money. I was on a conference call today with his economic advisor \u2014\n\nHUME: The word is \"invest.\"\n\nKONDRACKE: Wait, now that you're raising the issue, the country does need some public investment. And you never hear John McCain talk about. That is a bone I have to pick with McCain \u2014 no mention of infrastructure needs which we have to supply, no mention of public education investments, no mention of preschool education, that kind of stuff. Those are legitimate investments.\n\nYou got me off on this track \u2014 and all McCain wants to do is cut discretionary spending. This country will not advance in the world. But the problem is when Republicans add up all the spending and investment proposals and tax cuts that Obama is proposing, it comes to something like $3 trillion over a ten-year period, whereas, if you raise taxes on people over $250,000 a year, it comes to something like $1.5 trillion. That's a big gap, and it will only add to the deficit and the national debt.\n\nCHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: McCain is OK at making this case with a teleprompter, but when he's on his own, all he does is he slogans. He says that Obama is a tax and spend liberal as in the '60's and '70's.\n\nI wouldn't really bring up '60's and '70's, because nobody under 50 remembers the '60's. in fact, there are a lot of people over 50 who don't remember the '60's either for other reasons.\n\nAnd, secondly, the '60's was a time of prosperity. And the '70's, Republicans were in office until January of '77. So it's a hard argument to make.\n\nAnd then he says Obama will be the third Carter campaign. Well, that doesn't really ring a lot because the last Democratic administration was not Carter, but Clinton, and his economy was relatively strong.\n\nI think McCain has to get away \u2014 look, he'll fight Obama to a draw on taxes. But he has to do a bold thing, and I think he can win the economic argument in going after energy and gas. That's what's hurting. That's why Americans are angry \u2014 high gas prices.\n\nHe ought to say, two years ago, with gasoline at $2 a barrel(ph), I was against drilling. Conditions have changed, I have changed. Obama isn't a guy who changes. He is stuck in the past. We have to drill in the artic, we have to drill domestically.\n\nAnd every American understands if you get an American supply, we will be energy independent, and the price will come down. It is a case he can make, the Republicans are making it in Congress, but McCain has disarmed himself.\n\nHUME: Do you think there is any chance McCain would switch on that issue?\n\nKRAUTHAMMER: He's got to.\n\nBARNES: If he has a chance to be president, he might switch.\n\nIf you had united Republicans in Congress with the presidential candidate saying exactly what Charles is saying, that Republicans might thwart the cycle and do better than the otherwise would.\n\nHUME: You think it will take that, though?\n\nBARNES: I think it will.\n\nHUME: Do you agree with that, Mort?\n\nKONDRACKE: Yes. One interesting populist note is McCain is tougher on CEO pay than Obama actually is. McCain actually wants stockholders to approve the CEO's compensation package, whereas Obama just wants to have an advisory vote by stockholders.\n\nSo McCain has the populist ground on that one.\n\nHUME: When we return with our panel, Barack Obama says he will not replace one of his advisors over issues about his mortgages. We'll discuss that further in a moment.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: I am not vetting my V.P. search committee for their mortgages. It is a volunteer, unpaid position. And they're giving me information, and I will then exercise judgment in terms who I want to select as a vice presidential candidate. So these aren't folks who are working for me.\n\nCARLY FIORINA, MCCAIN CAMPAIGN ADVISER: Well, first, I find Barack Obama's statement today that Jim Johnson doesn't work for him naive at best. Of course Jim Johnson works for him.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHUME: Carly Fiorina, a McCain surrogate, responding there to what Barack Obama said today when he had a question put to him about Jim Johnson, whom we spoke about yesterday.\n\nJim Johnson is, of course, the former Mondale campaign chairman and long-time senior Washington Democrat, highly respected man of discretion, and generally believed to be a man of great integrity, headed the search committee, in addition to what he did for Mondale, also for John Kerry a few years ago.\n\nHe was for a number of years, of course, the head of Fannie Mae, at time in which he made a tremendous fortune. And while he was doing that, one of the companies that Fannie Mae did a lot of business with was Countrywide Mortgage, a company Barack Obama has repeatedly and specifically blamed for the nation's mortgage ills and has specifically singled out the former CEO of that company for his criticism.\n\nIt turns out Jim Johnson received some friendly terms loans from that company, Countrywide, and did so because he was a friend of the CEO. So the question arises is he the right guy to be vetting the candidate, and the real question is, are the answers that Barack Obama given to the questions that have been raised about Jim Johnson, someone we all know and have generally liked and admired over the years, are the answers sufficient \u2014 Charles?\n\nKRAUTHAMMER: I don't think it's a Johnson problem, I think it's an Obama problem. Johnson, there is no evidence to date that he has done anything either illegal or improper.\n\nHUME: I know, but is it proper for a guy who is a head of a company, who is farming out business and doing business with another company, to receive loans courtesy \u2014 special loans under a program courtesy of the CEO of the company?\n\nKRAUTHAMMER: But we don't know that there were any conditions that were unusual or favorable. Until that is established, then there is no impropriety.\n\nHUME: OK, got it.\n\nKRAUTHAMMER: The Obama problem is this \u2014 he is the guy who has two affectations. The first is he rises above politics. He is not a guy who is going to do business, he is going to clear the temple of all the insiders. Well, Johnson is an insider, and, by his own standard, he is getting somebody to help him who is what he has been demonizing for the last six months.\n\nHis other affectation, which he shares with other Democrats, is that when you have a national problem, you blame it on corporations and on individuals in those corporations. Senate Democrats are blaming oil prices on the oil companies and gouging. And Obama, he identifies the crisis as a matter of unfair practices by corporations, and he names them, including Countrywide.\n\nSo he is the one who claims that this large issue, which have to do with a lot of other causes, is a matter of misconduct on the part of corporations. Then, by his standard, he shouldn't be having somebody in his employ who has associations of any kind with those corporations, and specifically with the one corporation that he has demonized.\n\nKONDRACKE: He said today in his statement that Jim Johnson was not somebody that he was putting in his administration.\n\nNow, I think that's significant. Jim Johnson is somebody who has been talked about as a possibility for Treasury Secretary, and he certainly does have the qualifications as somebody who knows the financial markets very well to be Treasury Secretary. But if this kind of association is off limits in the Barack Obama administration, then he can't get people who have got any kind of taint at all connected with them. And this cozy deal with an insider that is a pariah now with Obama could be disqualifying.\n\nWhat's more, the fact that \u2014\n\nHUME: So is his answer going to hold up?\n\nKONDRACKE: Obama's? I don't think. I don't think he will have to get rid of Johnson, but he will have to come up with a better explanation than he is just doing this discreet job over here and I have nothing to do with it.\n\nHUME: He doesn't work for me.\n\nKONDRACKE: Yes, exactly. BARNES: And this is, of course, the biggest decision that Obama will make as a candidate, picking his running mate.\n\nHUME: At this stage, anyway.\n\nBARNES: And at this stage Johnson is running that.\n\nThis story is going to die, and, by the way, we don't know how much under market these loans might have been. We do know they were in a special program of Countrywide, the friends of the president of company, got the special treatment.\n\nBut the only way for this story, I think, to continue \u2014 it takes one person to step up and talk very strongly about it, and that's John McCain. His response yesterday was pathetic, and, I mean, he farms out Carly Fiorina. That's not enough.\n\nMcCain has to take it up. If he does, it will have legs. If he doesn't, it's gone.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2008 FOX News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Transcription Copyright 2008 Voxant, Inc.

Here are five facts about the Illinois Senator who aims to  become the first black president of the United States:           *Obama's father was born and raised in a village in Kenya; his  mother, who was white, grew up in Kansas.           *Obama grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia. He earned his law  degree from Harvard in 1991 and was the first African-American  president of the Harvard Law Review.           *He is married to wife Michelle and has two young  daughters.           *He was a member of the Illinois State Senate before being  elected to the U.S. Senate. His speech at the Democratic  National Convention in 2004 earned him national attention and  acclaim.           *On issues key to many Democratic voters, Obama favors  withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq, reducing carbon emissions to  fight climate change, and eliminating tax breaks from companies  that move jobs overseas.

      "Text": "A year after electing Barack Obama president, and five years after his star turn at the Democratic National Convention, we are still trying to figure him out.\n\nIs he a left-wing radical or is he a crowd-pleasing moderate? Is he a uniter? Is he actually religious? Is he a socialist? Does he hate America? And, in light of the confidence he projects, why can\u2019t he seem to take criticism?\n\nBut we could, of course, write that first sentence another way: Only a year after electing Barack Obama president, and we are already trying to figure him out.\n\nRather than it being kind of late to attempt a rigorous analysis of President Obama\u2019s psyche, his political philosophy and his managerial style, perhaps it\u2019s a little too soon. Presidential personalities, after all, develop over time. And the famous saying is true that great leaders aren\u2019t born, but made.\n\nNonetheless, because I\u2019m too young for caution, and too old for fear, I\u2019m more than happy to take a stab at it.\n\nLet me first assuage the fears of many of my conservative friends and colleagues: Barack Obama is not a left-wing radical. He is not a socialist, a communist or a Marxist, and he\u2019s not a black liberation theologist. He\u2019s not un-American, he\u2019s not an atheist, and he\u2019s not a racist.\n\nHe is none of those things, because all would require Barack Obama to have a belief system, a worldview, a set of convictions about political philosophy, theology, and socioeconomics that he simply doesn\u2019t have. He is, instead, empty. He is an empty vessel.\n\nThis will shock and offend his legion of admirers on the left, as it stands in stark contrast to the breathless, leg-thrilling declarations by liberal America that Obama is a deep-thinking, complex, contemplative scholar of soaring intellect, a new kind of leader, exquisitely built for a changing world, who knows the war isn\u2019t between good and evil, but between silence and diplomacy, and for whom indecision is a mark of judicious caution.\n\nBut he\u2019d done nothing to deserve those early accolades, of course. So all of that was pre-ordained and pre-packaged, the result of a coordinated and deliberate campaign by a coalition of marketers, politicos, and members of the press to brand Barack Obama as \u201chope and change\u201d before anyone even knew what his selling points were, or if he actually had any.\n\nThe proof of his ideological emptiness is practically undeniable. He has been, over the short course of his political career, the great abandoner, ever-willing to denounce those ideals that were previously sold to his constituents as \u201chis convictions.\u201d\n\nAfter 20 years in Reverend Wright\u2019s church, he simply got up and left. The man who baptized his children, who was marketed (to black voters in particular) as Obama\u2019s spiritual adviser, who was so integral in shaping Barack Obama\u2019s adult life, that he publicly denounced him, and left his church altogether. And he also denounced black liberation theology, despite giving numerous interviews about the ways in which it had helped shape his religious worldview. After initially defending Rev. Wright, suddenly he and his brand of religion were chucked out the window of a moving campaign bus. He has yet to find a replacement, unsurprisingly, but his interest in evangelicals like Rick Warren and Carey Cash means he is open to the theological polar opposite of Rev. Wright.\n\nThe same sort of dance occurred with other politically inconvenient allies, like domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, Wright apologist Father Michael Pfleger, and convicted felon Tony Rezko. Obama distanced himself from all of them and then eventually dumped them altogether when it became politically necessary. Van Jones was merely a post-election victim of Obama\u2019s willing abandonment. And there have been others.\n\nSo would a real radical disown his radical mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s? Would a real extremist and true-believer insist with a straight face that he didn\u2019t really believe all that stuff? Would a real ideologue be persuaded by a public opinion poll to abandon whole ideology?\n\nActual radicals like Wright and Ayers and Jones defend their beliefs, regardless of the pushback and potential fallout. What Obama did, in contrast, was purely political. Because, despite the insistence by the left that Obama somehow transcends politics, that\u2019s what he is \u2013 a politician. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nWe can also look at the shift in his policy positions over the past few years. He was once quoted as saying that he supported a single-payer health care system. The best political decision now, however, was to abandon that for a more docile public option. Once that failed to garner the groundswell of support his advisers thought it would, he appeared altogether indifferent to it. If he were reallya radical, he\u2019d be rallying us around universal health care right now, not some watered-down 1990-page bureaucratic hodge podge that is neither revolutionary nor practical.\n\nHis impassioned pledges to end \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d close Gitmo, bring troops home, end military tribunals, and myriad other promises, suddenly seem less like the stuff of real political conviction, and more like political headaches that require a clever exit strategy.\n\nAnd his reaction to any kind of opposition \u2013 from the right, from the citizenry, from Fox News \u2013 is equally telling. If Obama\u2019s agenda were based on conviction instead of political expedience and an unquenchable thirst for popularity, criticism would bounce right off him. Instead he seems frighteningly flappable. That\u2019s because leadership without convictions is leadership of empty rhetoric. Convictions can be defended against criticism. Empty rhetoric cannot.\n\nSo why all the radical friends and the radical proposals and the radical rhetoric if he\u2019s not himself a radical? Because his lack of conviction and his inability to forge his own philosophical and theological identity, have made him incredibly susceptible to external influence and pressure. He is easily led. He is, as such, the perfect prospect for someone like Bill Ayers or Reverend Wright, whose radical agendas require vulnerable recruits who are malleable and willing.\n\nI don\u2019t know if President Obama is a man of conviction, if he is a man of faith, or if he is the intellectual giant the left really wants him to be. He very well may be all of those things. But I haven\u2019t seen proof of any of it yet, and neither have you, because there hasn\u2019t been any.\n\nThe only thing we do know for sure, one year after anointing this relative unknown the forty-fourth president of the United States, is that he\u2019s a politician, pure and simple. Calling him a radical gives him way too much credit.\n\nS.E. Cupp is a write and co-author of \"Why You're Wrong About the Right.\" She is a frequent contributor to the Fox Forum.",

      "Text": "    Jan 20 (Reuters) - Barack Obama will be sworn in as the  44th president of the United States at noon on Tuesday.      Here are some biographical facts about the first  African-American to hold the nation's highest office.        Age: 47      Birthdate: Aug. 4, 1961      Birthplace: Honolulu, Hawaii      Education: Columbia University; Harvard Law School      Wife: Michelle Robinson Obama      Children: Daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7      Religious affiliation: United Church of Christ      Party: Democrat        Family: Barack Obama was born to a Kenyan father and a  white American mother. His father, Barack Obama Sr., married  his mother, Ann Dunham, while studying at the University of  Hawaii. The couple separated two years after Obama was born.  His father ultimately returned to Kenya, where he became a  noted economist. He died in a car accident in 1982.      Obama's mother's second marriage was to an Indonesian man  named Lolo Soetoro. The family moved to Indonesia and Obama  remained there until he was 10 when he moved back to Hawaii and  lived with his grandparents while studying on a scholarship at  the elite Punahou Academy.      He has seven half brothers and sisters in Kenya from his  father's other marriages, and a half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng,  from his mother's second marriage.        Career: After finishing college in 1983, Obama worked for a  New York financial consultancy and a consumer organization. He  landed a job in Chicago in 1985 as an organizer for Developing  Communities Project, a church-based group seeking to improve  living conditions in poor neighborhoods.      Three years later, Obama left to go to Harvard Law School,  where he became the first black president of the law review. He  worked as a summer associate at the Sidley Austin law firm in  Chicago, where he met his future wife. After graduation from  Harvard in 1991, Obama practiced civil rights law at a small  firm in Chicago, then became a lecturer in constitutional law  at the University of Chicago in 1993.        Elective office: Obama won a seat in the Illinois state  Senate in 1996. During his time in the Legislature, he worked  on welfare and ethics legislation, as well as a measure  requiring electronic recording of police interrogations and  confessions in homicide investigations.      Obama won a heavily contested U.S. Senate seat in 2004,  carrying 53 percent of the Democratic primary vote in an  eight-candidate race. He easily won the general election as  well. In the U.S. Senate he compiled a liberal voting record,  but was one of the few Democrats to back a measure on  class-action lawsuits. He opposed the appointment of Chief  Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito to the U.S.  Supreme Court.      The nonpartisan National Journal ranked him as the most  liberal member of the U.S. Senate early this year based on his  voting record in 2007. He was ranked 10th most liberal in 2006  and 16th most liberal in 2005.           Presidential campaign: Obama announced his presidential  candidacy on Feb. 10, 2007. Though New York Sen. Hillary  Clinton was initially seen as the front-runner for the  Democratic nomination, Obama quickly showed an ability to raise  large amounts of money and draw record-breaking crowds who were  attracted to his rhetorical skill, his opposition to the Iraq  war, and his promise to move beyond the divisive politics of  the past 40 years.      Obama won the first contest of the Democratic primary in  Iowa in",

      "Text": "(Refile to update headline)      Nov 5 (Reuters) - Barack Obama is the U.S. president-elect.  Following are some of his biographical details:        Age: 47      Birthdate: Aug. 4, 1961      Birthplace: Honolulu, Hawaii      Education: Columbia University; Harvard Law School      Wife: Michelle Robinson      Children: Two daughters      Religious affiliation: United Church of Christ        Family: Barack Obama was born in Hawaii to a Kenyan father  and a white American mother. His father, Barack Obama Sr.,  married his mother, Ann Dunham, while studying at the  University of Hawaii. The couple separated two years after  Obama was born. His father ultimately returned to Kenya, where  he became a noted economist. He died in a car accident in 1982.      Obama's mother's second marriage was to an Indonesian man  named Lolo Soetoro. The family moved to Indonesia and Obama  remained there until he was 10 when he moved back to Hawaii and  lived with his grandparents while studying on a scholarship at  the elite Punahou Academy.      He has seven half brothers and sisters in Kenya from his  father's other marriages, and a half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng,  from his mother's second marriage.        Career: After finishing college in 1983, Obama worked for a  New York financial consultant and a consumer organization. He  landed a job in Chicago in 1985 as an organizer for Developing  Communities Project, a church-based group seeking to improve  living conditions in poor neighborhoods.      Three years later, Obama left to go to Harvard Law School,  where he became the first black president of the law review. He  worked as a summer associate at the Sidley Austin law firm in  Chicago, where he met his future wife. After graduation from  Harvard in 1991, Obama practiced civil rights law at a small  firm in Chicago, then became a lecturer in constitutional law  at the University of Chicago in 1993.        Elective office: Obama won a seat in the Illinois state  Senate in 1996. During his time in the legislature, he worked  on welfare and ethics legislation, as well as a measure  requiring electronic recording of police interrogations and  confessions in homicide investigations.      Obama won a heavily contested U.S. Senate seat in 2004,  carrying 53 percent of the Democratic primary vote in an  eight-candidate race. He easily won the general election. In  the Senate he compiled a liberal voting record, but was one of  the few Democrats to back a measure on class-action lawsuits.  He opposed the appointment of Chief Justice John Roberts and  Justice Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court.      The nonpartisan National Journal ranked him as the most  liberal member of the Senate early this year based on his  voting record in 2007. He was ranked 10th most liberal in 2006  and 16th most liberal in 2005.

The plan would include an immediate $250 tax credit to workers  that could double if the economy worsens; a one-time $250  supplement to Social Security retirement payments, a $10 billion  fund to help homeowners facing foreclosure, and a $10 billion fund  to bolster states facing budget shortfalls.      The Illinois senator's office unveiled the proposals while  campaigning in Nevada, which holds the next contested Democratic  primary on Saturday. His leading rival, New York Sen. Hillary  Clinton, also recently unveiled an economic stimulus package.

      "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Barack Obama was voted the  most influential man of 2008 in an online poll released on  Tuesday that asked men to decide who most impacted the way they  behave, buy and think.      The U.S. Democratic presidential candidate was ranked No.1  by readers on the AskMen.com lifestyle Web site, beating Apple  chief executive Steve Jobs and Olympic swimming champion  Michael Phelps, who landed in the No. 2 and No. 3 spots,  respectively.      Republican presidential candidate John McCain was ranked  No. 10 on the list, which was compiled on the basis of 200,000  votes from readers of the Web site whose average age is 27-28  years-old.      Last year's winner, British soccer star David Beckham, fell  to No. 25 on the 2008 list, which asked men to go beyond  professional success and likability when picking their top 49  choices.      James Bassil, editor-in-chief of AskMen.com, said he  thought Obama's top place was not so much a political  endorsement of his candidacy as 'a reflection of the interest  the presidential race has ignited in the United States.'      Stephen Colbert, host of the satirical news show 'The  Colbert Report,' was the only other politically-minded name in  the Top 10 of the 2008 list, which was dominated by sports  stars, actors and musicians.

Here are five facts about the Illinois Senator who aims to  become the first black president of the United States:           *Obama's father was born and raised in a village in Kenya; his  mother, who was white, grew up in Kansas.           *Obama grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia. He earned his law  degree from Harvard in 1991 and was the first African-American  president of the Harvard Law Review.           *He is married to wife Michelle and has two young  daughters.           *He was a member of the Illinois State Senate before being  elected to the U.S. Senate. His speech at the Democratic  National Convention in 2004 earned him national attention and  acclaim.           *On issues key to many Democratic voters, Obama favors  withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq, reducing carbon emissions to  fight climate change, and eliminating tax breaks from companies  that move jobs overseas.

      "Text": "Tension is rising between India and Pakistan because it looks like the killers who attacked Mumbai were based inside Pakistani territory. If shooting breaks out between these two countries, the world will have yet another crisis created by Muslim terrorists.\n\nIt is obvious to sane people that the American intelligence agencies must continue to stay ahead of the terror-killers and disrupt plots like Mumbai should they be directed here. To do that, information from captured terror suspects becomes vital.\n\nBut President-elect Obama has committed himself to an undefined no torture policy and is also having some difficulty finding someone to head up the CIA. Former CIA Chief of Staff John Brennan has taken himself out of the running because some far-left loons criticized him for taking an aggressive anti-terror stance after 9/11.\n\nThis is very disturbing. The far-left wants the CIA to go by the Army Field Manual when interrogating suspects. If that happens, all of us will be in danger.\n\nWhy? Well, here's what the manual says: \"Prisoners of war who refuse to answer (questions) may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.\"\n\nNow \u2014 and this is important \u2014 that is fine for the military. It is not their job to break down terror suspects. It's their job to kill or capture them on the battlefield. The CIA should interrogate high-value targets.\n\nBut if Obama orders the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies not to employ any tough interrogation methods, trust me, many people will die. The terrorists are not going to stop, and only very aggressive action against them has kept us safe since 9/11.\n\nBut these far-left loons, these despicable people who blame America for worldwide terrorism, now have far more power in this country than they did just one month ago.\n\nI believe Barack Obama understands the danger the Muslim terrorists pose to the world. I believe Mr. Obama will not destroy the CIA's ability to break down terror suspects. He has to know that hardcore terrorists are not going to give up information easily.\n\nBut still some people don't get it, and these people are foolish and dangerous, so crazed by their far-left ideology they'd allow innocent people to die for it.\n\nThe USA should never torture, but coerced interrogation at the direction of the president is vital when lives are on the line. Of course, the loons will never acknowledge that. They don't want to do anything \"unpleasant\" to terror suspects.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nAs you may know, actor Patrick Swayze is waging a valiant fight against pancreatic cancer. The 56-year-old actor is working on a new TV show and generally fighting the good fight.\n\nBut a number of tabloids continue to sound the death knell for him, and Mr. Swayze would like them to knock it off. We hope they do, because the man is brave and a patriot.\n\nOn the pinhead front, you make the call on this one. At the opening of a new visitors' center at the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said this:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID, D-NEV.: My staff has always said, \"Don't say this,\" but I'm going to say it again, because it's so descriptive, because it's true.\n\nLeader Boehner mentioned that tourists lined up in the summer and winter, long lines coming into the Capitol. In the summertime, because of the high humidity and how hot it gets here, you could literally smell the tourists coming into the Capitol.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nNo matter how bad the folks smell, it doesn't compete with some of the stuff going on in the Senate.\n\nPinhead? You make the call.\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads & Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

      "Text": "    By Caren Bohan      EVANSVILLE, Ind., April 23 (Reuters) - Barack Obama's rapid  rise from relative obscurity toward winning the Democratic  Party nomination for U.S. president hit another bump when he  lost to rival Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania.      Obama's defeat on Tuesday in the state's nominating contest  slowed his momentum, but he still holds the lead in delegates  who will decide the party's nominee to run against Republican  John McCain in the November presidential election.      Just four years after he burst onto the national political  scene with a keynote speech at the Democratic Party convention,  the questions for those deciding whether to support Obama have  been mostly about his relative inexperience.      Is the 46-year-old first-term senator who would be the  first black U.S. president just a 'phenomenon' desired by a  war-weary nation eager for a fresh face or does he have what it  takes to be an effective president?      Obama cast his scant time on the national political scene  as an advantage, saying it meant his hope and ideals had not  been compromised. His rousing oratory and can-do message struck  a chord early with the public, drawing large crowds and  enthusing young voters.      Doubts over whether voters were 'ready' for a black  president diminished as he steadily chipped away at Clinton's  large early lead and eventually moved past her in the long  run-up to the presidential election.      Once the race was down to two Democratic candidates, there  was little to distinguish them on policy issues.           MULTICULTURAL AMERICA      Obama often points to his roots -- his father was Kenyan  and his mother a white woman from Kansas -- as one reason he  should be picked to run the country, saying he is   representative of multicultural America.      One of his favorite lines --- 'When you're a black guy  named Barack Obama and you're running for president you've got  to have hope' -- regularly draws laughs.      But it is clear Obama has also asked serious questions  about his heritage.      A two-time bestselling author who also won two Grammy  awards for the audio version of his books, Obama chronicled his  struggles to understand himself and his race in 1995 in 'Dreams  from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance.'      He followed up the memoir in 2006 with 'The Audacity of  Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream' outlining his  political principles.      While attracting wide support among African Americans,  Obama eschewed the rhetoric of race struggle and structured his  campaign to appeal to all races.      He has also described himself as a 'blank screen' on which  people of all different political leanings can project their  own views.        CLOSER SCRUTINY      As he moved ahead in the polls and the race for delegates  who pick the party nominee, Democratic and Republican opponents  took a closer look at his record and associates.      Video of Jeremiah Wright, his black pastor at the Trinity  United Church of Christ in Chicago, giving racially and  politically charged sermons, including saying U.S. policies  were partially responsible for Sept. 11 attacks, surfaced on  the Internet in March.      Obama, who borrowed the words 'audacity of hope' from  Wright, was forced to disavow his pastor and ended up giving a  much-praised speech on race in America.      Suddenly, every word and action was under a microscope.  Comments to a closed-door fund-raiser earlier this month sayi",

      "Text": "  - Bernd Debusmann is a Reuters columnist. The opinions  expressed are his own -      By Bernd Debusmann      WASHINGTON, June 18 (Reuters) - Barack Obama has won the  endorsement of the Ku Klux Klan in his bid to become the first  black president of the United States. His campaign is financed  by Hugo Chavez, the vocally anti-American leader of Venezuela.  Obama is a Muslim. And possibly, he is the anti-Christ.      So say e-mails circulating on the Internet, whose  importance as a marketplace for the exchange of unverified  information, sometimes outlandish ideas and often toxic rumors  has exploded over the last decade. It is now playing a key role  in American politics. According to a new study, almost half of  all Americans use the Internet to follow the presidential  election campaign.      Now Obama, who already made political history by becoming  the first black American to win the Democratic party's  presidential nomination, is making Internet history with a Web  site specifically set up to counter rumors about him and his  wife Michelle. It is a break with the conventional wisdom that  it is counter-productive to respond to rumor and innuendo in  the parallel world of cyberspace. Doing so, the thinking goes,  gives a rumor an air of legitimacy.      The novel Web site, fightthesmears.com, does not deal with  each and every online 'discovery' about Obama. A Ku Klux Klan  endorsement, Chavez financing, and anti-Christ suspicions are  too bizarre to rate a mention.  E-mails on these subjects were  collated by snopes.com, a Web site that features the '25  Hottest Urban Legends, currently circulating most widely.'  Obama e-mails rank No. 2 on the latest list, after e-mails on a  computer virus embedded in greeting cards.      To satisfy the curious: the Ku Klux Klan story originated  as a spoof in the satirical British publication Daily Squib and  gained currency because, as snopes.com put it, 'effective  satire hews closely to what people are inclined to believe.'   Well ... perhaps people on the lunatic fringe. The spoof quoted  a clan leader as saying that 'anything is better than Hillary  Clinton,' the New York senator who lost the primaries to  Obama.      Obama's counter-rumor Web site addresses one of the most  widely circulated, and most widely believed, assertions about  the candidate: that he is Muslim, attended a radical madrassa  (Islamic religious school) and was sworn into the U.S. Senate  using the Koran. The Obama-is-a-Muslim theme has been so  persistent that 10 percent of American voters are convinced he  is, according to a poll in March by the Pew Research Center        WIFE IS TARGET      The rumor that prompted Obama to set up the site last week  involved his wife Michelle. Right-wing bloggers spoke of the  existence of a videotape that showed her making an angry speech  featuring the word 'whitey,' a derogatory term for white  people.  'No such tape exists,' says the anti-rumor site,  'Michelle has not used that word.'      To disprove the notion that Obama was born outside the  United States and therefore ineligible to be president, the Web  site features a facsimile of his birth certificate, issued by  the Department of Health in Honolulu and dated August 8, 1961.  (Hawaii became a state in 1959).      The Internet, being an equal opportunity debating forum,  was alive with arguments earlier in the year over the  eligibility to the highest office in the land of John McCain,  Obama's Republican rival who was",

      "Text": " (Adds details, quote)      LAS VEGAS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Amid growing worries about a  worsening of the U.S. economy, Democratic presidential  candidate Barack Obama proposed a $75 billion economic stimulus  plan on Sunday that includes worker tax credits, a one-time  pension supplement and help to homeowners facing foreclosure.      The plan would include an immediate $250 tax credit to  workers that could double if the economy worsens, a one-time  $250 supplement to Social Security payments, a $10 billion fund  to help homeowners facing foreclosure and a $10 billion fund to  bolster states facing budget shortfalls amid lower tax  revenues.      'We need that middle-class tax cut now more than ever --  not five months from now or five weeks from now, but now,'  Obama said in a statement. 'I'm announcing a plan to jump-start  the economy by putting money in the pockets of those who need  it most and will spend it quickly.'      The Illinois senator's office unveiled the proposals at the  start of a day of campaigning in Nevada, which holds the next  contested Democratic primary on Saturday.      His leading rival, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, on Friday  unveiled an economic stimulus package she said would be worth  $70 billion. Her plan placed more of an emphasis on helping  families unable to make mortgage payments -- a major issue in  Nevada where 'for sale' signs are common on homes across Las  Vegas, its major city.      The plan also includes a $10 billion extension of  unemployment insurance to help those who have been unable to  find a job for more than half a year.      Last year, the senator proposed tax credits of up to $500  for 150 million workers. His revised economic plan calls for  $250 of that to come in an immediate credit, and the rest as  soon as three months later if the nation's unemployment rate  worsens.

His visit thrusts U.S. strategy in Iraq and troop levels to  the centre of the November election race between the first-term  senator from Illinois and Republican candidate John McCain.  There are more than 140,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq.      Obama has called for the removal of U.S. combat troops  within 16 months of taking office should he win the election.      Iraqiya state television and witnesses said Obama met Prime  Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad. There were no further  details on Obama's visit, which has been shrouded in secrecy for  security reasons.      Obama visited Afghanistan over the weekend, the other big  foreign policy challenge the next American president will face.  He called the situation in Afghanistan 'precarious and urgent'  and said Washington should start planning to transfer more  troops there from Iraq.      Maliki suggested earlier this month setting a timetable for  U.S. troops to leave Iraq but has given no dates.      Obama has welcomed Maliki's suggestion but some Iraqis  insist that the army and police cannot go it alone and that a  premature withdrawal of U.S. troops could open the door to the  sort of violence that nearly tore Iraq apart not so long ago.      On Sunday the Iraqi government denied Maliki told a German  magazine in an interview that he backed Obama's plan to withdraw  combat troops within 16 months. The government said Maliki's  remarks to Der Spiegel were translated incorrectly.       McCain has attacked Obama for not visiting Iraq recently to  get a first-hand look at conditions.      The Republican candidate has been to Iraq eight times while  Obama's only other trip was in January 2006, a month before  militants blew up a revered Shi'ite shrine in Samarra in an  attack that plunged Iraq into vicious sectarian fighting.      The U.S. embassy said Obama, who is visiting Iraq as part of  a U.S. congressional delegation, would also meet U.S. military  commanders and American troops.      Commanders are likely to tell Obama that security gains are  fragile and could be jeopardised by a hasty troop withdrawal.      Obama, trying to boost his foreign policy credentials, will  travel to other countries in the Middle East and visit major  powers in Europe this week.      He has scheduled no news conferences in Iraq.            OBAMA SAYS WANTS TO END THE WAR      Obama courted controversy on July 3 when he said he might  'refine' his views on withdrawing combat troops from Iraq within  16 months but later said his stance had been unchanged for more  than a year and that he intended 'to end this war'.      McCain says the U.S. troop buildup last year helped boost  stability in Iraq and has criticised the Democrat's vow to order  a quick withdrawal as 'reckless'.      But the dramatic reduction in violence has led Baghdad to  become increasingly assertive about its own security  capabilities.      Indeed, Maliki and President George W. Bush agreed last week  to set a 'time horizon' for reducing American forces in Iraq.      It was the closest the",

'I'm announcing a plan to jump-start  the economy by putting money in the pockets of those who need  it most and will spend it quickly.'      If he won his party's nomination and then the November  election, Obama would take office in January 2009.      The Illinois senator's office unveiled the proposals at the  start of a day of campaigning in Nevada, which holds the next  contested Democratic primary on Saturday.      The 'goal would be to help the U.S. economy from going into  recession,' his economic advisor Austan Goolsbee told  reporters.      Obama's leading rival, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, on  Friday unveiled an economic stimulus package she said would be  worth $70 billion. Her plan placed more of an emphasis on  helping families unable to make mortgage payments -- a major  issue in Nevada where 'for sale' signs are common on homes  around heavily populated Las Vegas.      'There are some similarities,' Goolsbee said of the two  plans. The biggest difference with Obama's plan is that 'the  absolutely most imperative thing is to get the money into the  people's hands immediately so they can spent it.'      'The stimulus does increase the deficit in the immediate  term,' the economic adviser said, adding that preventing a  recession could have 'profound' budget implications.      The Obama plan also includes a $10 billion extension of  unemployment insurance to help those who have been unable to  find a job for more than six months.      The foreclosure help plan would be aimed at 'responsible  homeowners' who live in their primary residences, Goolsbee  said. Las Vegas has been hit hard by the subprime loan crisis,  but many of those suffering bought additional houses hoping  that fast rising prices amid a prosperous local economy would  lead to easy money.      Last year, Obama proposed tax credits of up to $500 for 150  million workers. His revised economic plan calls for $250 of  that to come in an immediate credit, and the rest as soon as  three months later if the nation's unemployment rate worsens.

      "Text": "With the announcement Friday that President Obama will leave about 50,000 troops in Iraq after the bulk of U.S. forces withdraw in 2010, it is becoming clear that on foreign policy the president will govern from the center.\n\nBut it is also now certain that he is a far-left guy on domestic policy. The new budget is simply stunning. Mr. Obama wants to spend more money than at any time since World War II.\n\nPredictably, quasi-socialists like New York Times columnist Paul Krugman are delirious with joy. Here comes the nanny state, starring President Obama and Fran Drescher.\n\nAlso predictably, conservatives like Glenn Beck are outfitting caves in the mountains. The decline and fall of America is at hand.\n\n\"Talking Points\" cannot imagine any Republican senator supporting the massive budget, so it will have trouble getting passed.\n\nBut the die has been cast. President Obama is \"all in\" for a colossal change in American society. That change means the rich will support the poor. Americans who do not succeed will have their bills paid by people like me \u2014 and Barack Obama when he becomes a private citizen again.\n\nThat also means we'll have some kind of new energy in this country, but nobody knows when or what. However, there's plenty of money that will fund the mystery.\n\nAnd gazillions more dollars will flow into America's schools. What this will do, I don't know because if the kids walk around all day with iPods in their ears and rings in their noses, money simply won't matter.\n\nNow, \"Talking Points\" knows he's a mean guy. Criticizing the kids? Come on, how can I do that? Whining about paying other people's bills? That's just downright mean, is it not?\n\nWell that's how the far-left is portraying it. Listen to this new commercial from some progressive loons:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: An economy in crisis, a president determined to act, but what did Republican leaders say to President Obama's jobs and recovery plan?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did they say to 3.5 million jobs?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did they say to tax cuts for 95 percent of working Americans?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: So who are Republican leaders listening to?\n\nRUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: I want him to fail.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tell them America won't take no for an answer anymore.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nThat's what passes for debate these days on the far left: running down anyone with whom they disagree.\n\nBut as \"Talking Points\" said Thursday night, President Obama is taking an enormous gamble, one that will affect all of our lives. He has audacity, no question. But the outcome is still mostly hope.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nOnce a year the Filene's Basement department store here in New York City mounts a sale called the \"Running of the Brides.\" The ladies line up hours ahead of time to get discounts on wedding dresses, and then when the doors open the track meet begins. The excitement is generated by dresses that once cost thousands of dollars marked down to hundreds of dollars.\n\nNow this might be a stretch, but I'm making the ladies patriots because they are thrifty, and we need that in America. So there.\n\nOn the pinhead front, welcome to Will Ferrell's world. The comedian, currently starring in the hit Broadway play about President Bush, started out as the \"Senior Prince of the Winter Ball\" at University High School in Irvine, California.\n\nClick here to see the picture!\n\nNow anyone seeing this picture back then could have predicted Mr. Ferrell would achieve great success. The only mystery: in what area?\n\nPinhead? You make the call.\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads & Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

      "Text": "    * Obama to meet Iraqi leaders, U.S. commanders      * Wants U.S. combat troops out in 16 months if wins election      * Obama last visited Iraq in January 2006            By Dean Yates      BAGHDAD, July 21 (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential  candidate Barack Obama flew into Baghdad on Monday, officials  said, thrusting U.S. strategy in Iraq and troop levels to the  centre-stage of the November election race.      Obama has called for the removal of U.S. combat troops from  Iraq within 16 months of taking office should he win the  election. He visited Afghanistan over the weekend, the other big  foreign policy challenge the next American president will face.      Obama has come under attack from Republican candidate John  McCain for not making a recent visit to assess conditions in  Iraq, where violence is at a four-year low. McCain has been to  Iraq eight times while Obama's only other trip was in 2006.      The U.S. embassy said Obama, who is visiting Iraq as part of  a U.S. congressional delegation, would meet senior Iraqi  officials and U.S. military commanders.      Seeking to boost his foreign policy credentials, Obama will  travel to other countries in the Middle East and also visit  major powers in Europe this week.      Obama courted controversy on July 3 when he said he might  'refine' his views on withdrawing combat troops from Iraq within  16 months but later said his stance had been unchanged for more  than a year and that he intended 'to end this war'.      McCain says a U.S. troop buildup last year helped boost  stability in Iraq and has criticised Democrats' vows for a quick  withdrawal as 'reckless'.      But with violence down dramatically, Baghdad has become  increasingly assertive about its own security capabilities.      Indeed, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and President  George W. Bush agreed late last week to set a 'time horizon' for  reducing American forces in Iraq.      It was the closest the Bush administration has come to  acknowledging the need for a timeframe for U.S. troop cuts. Bush  has long opposed deadlines for troop withdrawals.      Maliki earlier this month suggested setting a timetable for  U.S. troops to leave Iraq, although he had given no dates.      But the Iraqi government has denied Maliki told a German  magazine in an interview released on Saturday that he backed  Obama's plan to withdraw combat troops within 16 months.      The government has said Maliki's remarks to Der Spiegel were  misunderstood and translated incorrectly.       In a speech last Tuesday, Obama said a 'single-minded' focus  on Iraq was distracting the United States from other threats,  and he promised to shift resources to fighting al Qaeda and the  Taliban in Afghanistan.      Obama called the situation in Afghanistan 'precarious and  urgent' on Sunday and said Washington should start planning to  transfer more troops there from Iraq.

Bush, who leaves office on Jan. 20 when Barack Obama is  sworn in, will give a 10-15 minute speech in front of an  audience in the East Room of the White House, press secretary  Dana Perino said Monday.      It will be Bush's last scheduled public event before he  steps down, and comes as he tries to burnish a presidential  legacy marked by the unpopular war in Iraq and the worst  financial crisis in nearly 80 years.      'This is not going to be a swan song to the president's  administration, although he will defend his record, but it will  be very gracious to President-elect Obama,' Perino said.      'It's not something where he's trying to refight old  battles. It's a very thoughtful, forward-looking speech in  which the president will share the lessons he learned in office  and his views on the future,' Perino said.      The White House has asked the major television networks for  a slot to broadcast his address, but an exact time has not yet  been set.      Bush's farewell speech will be in keeping with a ritual  followed by his recent predecessors in the White House.

Olmert, who resigned in September in a corruption scandal  but remains prime minister until a new government is formed after  Israel's Feb. 1O election, also will meet U.S. Jewish leaders  before departing on Tuesday.      A spokesman for Olmert said that besides taking stock of the  ongoing Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, Monday's talks in  the White House will also focus on Iran's nuclear program.      No major announcements are expected after the meeting, but  the spokesman said: 'When the president of the United States and  the prime minister of Israel get together, they always have  serious matters to discuss.'

      "Text": " (Adds details, background)      By Matt Spetalnick      BAGHDAD, Dec 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush  made an unannounced farewell visit to Baghdad on Sunday, just  weeks before he leaves office and bequeaths the unpopular Iraq  war to President-elect Barack Obama.      Slipping out of the White House over the weekend, Bush flew  secretly to the Iraqi capital to hold talks with Prime Minister  Nuri al-Maliki and address a rally of U.S. troops.      'Bush has come to meet Iraqi leaders, thank the troops and  celebrate the new security agreement,' a White House official  said.      Bush arrived first by helicopter at the presidential palace  for talks with President Jalal Talabani and his two  vice-presidents. He planned to meet later with Maliki.      Bush's trip -- his fourth to Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led  invasion -- follows approval of a security pact between  Washington and Baghdad last month that paves the way for U.S.  forces to withdraw by the end of 2011.       Bush was greeted on the heavily guarded tarmac in Baghdad  by General Raymond Odierno and Ambassador Ryan Crocker.      The decision to land in broad daylight reflected confidence  that Baghdad was more secure this time than during Bush's last  visit to the capital in 2006 when sectarian violence was raging.     Though Iraq has slipped down the list of Americans' concerns  as the recession-hit U.S. economy has taken center stage, polls  show most people think the war was a mistake.      It will now be left to Obama, a Democrat and early opponent  of U.S. military involvement in Iraq, to sort out an exit  strategy after he takes office on Jan. 20.      About 140,000 U.S. troops will still be in Iraq nearly six  years into a war that has killed more than 4,200 American  military personnel and tens of thousands of Iraqis.      Bush's visit, just 11 days before Christmas, was a final  chance for him to bid farewell to troops on the ground there.      Mindful of the threat still posed by militants, the White  House kept a tight lid of secrecy on Bush's trip before he  landed at Baghdad International Airport.      His movements were expected to be limited to the heavily  fortified sites in and around the Iraqi capital.      Bush was last in Iraq in September 2007, when he flew into a  U.S. air base in the restive Anbar province to underscore  improved security amid a 30,000-troop buildup and growing  support of Sunni tribal chiefs in the fight against al Qaeda.      Since then, there has been further progress in Baghdad and  elsewhere, and Iraqi security forces are increasingly taking  charge of policing streets and going after militants.            PULLOUT TIMETABLE      U.S. Gen. David Petraeus said last week that violence in  Iraq in the past few weeks had fallen to its lowest level since  mid-2003 and that security gains, while still at risk of  reversal, were less fragile than before. Car bombings and  suicide blasts are still common.      Bush will meet Maliki for the first time since the Iraqi  government won a key concession -- Washington's agreement on a  pullout timetable, something the U.S. president long opposed.      Obama pledged during the campaign to withdraw U.S. combat  troops in 16 months, which will now have to reconciled with the  timetable set in the new security deal.      As he prepares to step down, Bush has insisted toppling  Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was the right thing to do.      But he said in a recent ABC interview that the 'big",

      "Text": " (Adds details)      By Matt Spetalnick      BAGHDAD, Dec 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush  made an unannounced farewell visit to Baghdad on Sunday, just  weeks before he leaves office and bequeaths the unpopular Iraq  war to President-elect Barack Obama.      Bush flew secretly to the Iraqi capital to hold talks with  Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and address a rally of U.S.  troops.      'Bush has come to meet Iraqi leaders, thank the troops and  celebrate the new security agreement,' a White House official  said.      Bush arrived first by helicopter at the presidential palace  for talks with President Jalal Talabani and his two  vice-presidents. He planned to meet later with Maliki.      Bush's trip -- his fourth to Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led  invasion -- follows approval of a security pact between  Washington and Baghdad last month that paves the way for U.S.  forces to withdraw by the end of 2011.      The brief visit was meant to showcase recent security gains  in Iraq but was also a stark reminder of how heavily the war  will weigh on the Republican president's foreign policy legacy.      Though Iraq has slipped down the list of Americans' concerns  as the recession-hit U.S. economy has taken center stage, polls  show most people think the war was a mistake.      It will now be left to Obama, a Democrat and early opponent  of U.S. military involvement in Iraq, to sort out an exit  strategy after he takes office on Jan. 20.      About 140,000 U.S. troops will still be in Iraq nearly six  years into a war that has killed more than 4,200 American  military personnel and tens of thousands of Iraqis.      Bush's visit, just 11 days before Christmas, was a final  chance for him to bid farewell to troops on the ground there.      He was greeted on the heavily guarded tarmac in Baghdad by  the top U.S. commander in Iraq, General Ray Odierno, and U.S.  Ambassador Ryan Crocker.      The decision to land in broad daylight reflected confidence  that Baghdad was more secure this time than in Bush's last visit  to the capital in 2006 when sectarian violence was raging.            'REGRET'      Until Air Force One touched down, Bush's trip was conducted  in strictest secrecy. The presidential jet was rolled out of its  giant hangar only after everyone was onboard. Journalists'  electronic devices, from cellphones to iPods, were confiscated  until mid-flight.      Bush, dressed casually and wearing a black baseball cap  after his night-time getaway from the White House, made a rare  appearance in the press cabin just before takeoff.      'Nobody knew who I was,' he joked when an aide complimented  him on his disguise.      His movements were expected to be limited to the heavily  fortified sites in and around the Iraqi capital.      Bush was last in Iraq in September 2007, when he flew into a  U.S. air base in the restive Anbar province to underscore  improved security amid a 30,000-troop build-up and growing  support of Sunni tribal chiefs in the fight against al Qaeda.      Since then, there has been further progress in Baghdad and  elsewhere, and Iraqi security forces are increasingly taking  charge of policing streets and going after militants.      U.S. General David Petraeus said last week that violence in  Iraq in the past few weeks had fallen to its lowest level since  mid-2003 and that security gains, while still at risk of  reversal, were less fragile than before. Car bombings and  suicide blasts are still common.      B",

      "Text": "    By Benet Koleka      FUSHE-KRUJE, Albania, Jan 17 (Reuters) - At the 'George W.  Bush' cafe in this little Albanian town, owner Festim Cela gives  a solemn reply when asked if it will change its name when the  U.S. President leaves office on Tuesday.      Many beyond U.S. shores may welcome the end of Bush's  presidency, but in zealously pro-American Albania, he is feted  as a hero.      'As long as this building stands, its name will be George W.  Bush,' Cela said as he watched television pictures of Bush's   farewell speech the week before Barack Obama succeeds him.      Below the TV is a table where Bush sat to discuss a  U.S.-funded micro-loan programme with a baker, a barber, a  tailor and a shepherd when he visited Fushe-Kruje on June 10,  2007.      The chairs bear a copper plate with names of Bush and his  wife Laura.      People in Fushe-Kruje said they were sad to see him leave  and cherished the memory of his visit.      Waving and blowing kisses, a shirt-sleeved Bush crossed the  main street from Cela's cafe to Klarita Topi's bakery, where  pictures of his visit hang on the wall.      'His visit was a big blessing for the people of Fushe-Kruje,  for our business and the whole of Albania,' Topi said.      'It was a day of great joy. He got us into NATO, made us  known to the world, and all has gone well for us.'      Topi's bakery and Cela's cafe have turned into landmarks for  Albanians and foreigners keen to see places Bush visited.      Topi, who received a loan under the U.S. programme, said  Albanian migrant workers returning home came to see the shop.  Italian tourists thought the photos were fakes.      'President Bush came to Fushe-Kruje with the independence of  Kosovo. This is a big debt which can never be returned. Thanks  U.S.,' Rasim Qorraj from Decani in Kosovo wrote in a book Cela  keeps at the cafe along with the Albanian, U.S. and EU flags.      Albania, once an isolated state, has blossomed since the  fall of communism in 1990 and now embraces all things Western.      It's people reserve special affection for the United States,  which they credit not only with ending their Cold War isolation  but also for leading NATO in 1999 to rescue the Albanians of  neighboring Kosovo from 'ethnic cleansing' by Serbia.      'Thank you Mr. Bush! Thank you U.S.A.! God Bless U.S. Semper  Fidelis (Always Faithful),' wrote Agim Gashi.      Bush backed Kosovo's independence during the visit and urged  the Kosovo Albanians to be patient. The United States was one of  the first countries to recognize Kosovo's independence in  February 2008.      The visit was also marked by reports Bush lost or had his  watch stolen there but television pictures showed he had given  it to a bodyguard.     'I wish he had another mandate,' Cela said.'      Bush, the first U.S. President to visit the ex-communist  state, dived into a throng of waiting Albanian fans and enjoyed  a rock-star reception.      While meeting the crowd, Bush stopped and embraced  70-year-old Thomaidha Kaziu.      'I started shaking with emotion. There were a lot of people  behind me who wanted to meet him. I was told he said I resembled  his mother. It was a great day for me,' Kaziu said.

      "Text": " (Updates with speech)      By Matt Spetalnick and Tabassum Zakaria      WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - President George W. Bush on  Thursday defended his actions to avert a collapse of the  financial system and protect America from another terrorist  attack as he mounted a farewell bid to polish his troubled  legacy.      Five days before handing over the presidency to Barack  Obama, Bush delivered a televised final address to the American  people in which he sought to define a White House record that  some historians are already ranking among the worst ever.      But even as he focused on what he saw as his successes,  Bush was preparing to leave Obama with unfinished wars in Iraq  and Afghanistan, a bitter conflict in Gaza, a U.S. economy deep  in recession and a U.S. image badly tarnished overseas.      'Facing the prospect of a financial collapse, we took  decisive measures to safeguard our economy,' Bush said from the  White House, referring to a massive government intervention he  ordered, counter to his free-market roots. 'The toll would be  far worse if we had not acted.'      Trying to reassure recession-weary Americans, Bush said:  'Together, with determination and hard work, we will restore  our economy to the path of growth. We will show the world once  again the resilience of America's free enterprise system.'      Obama has said dealing with the economic meltdown, the  worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and one that  has sent shockwaves across the globe, will be a top priority.      Bush warned, however, that the gravest challenge facing the  incoming president remained the threat of another terrorist  attack like the al Qaeda strikes on Sept. 11, 2001.      He acknowledged that some of his actions in response to  9/11 had been controversial but he stood by them and reasserted  his with-us-or-against-us doctrine widely criticized overseas.      'There is legitimate debate about many of these decisions.  But there can be little debate about the results,' the two-term  Republican said. 'America has gone more than seven years  without another terrorist attack on our soil,' he said.      Some of Bush's actions after the 9/11 attacks, such as  establishing a detention center for terrorism suspects at  Guantanamo and approving harsh interrogation methods that human  rights groups said amounted to torture, severely damaged  America's image abroad. Obama has vowed to close the facility.      'Our enemies are patient, and determined to strike again,'  Bush said in a brief address from the White House with Vice  President Dick Cheney, his Cabinet and several dozen selected  citizens in attendance. 'Good and evil are present in this  world, and between the two there can be no compromise.'           POSITIVE SPIN      With the clock ticking down on his presidency, Bush and his  aides used his last day of public events before Inauguration  Day to try to put a positive spin on his record.      Farewell speeches are a ritual for departing U.S. leaders,  but the stakes are especially high for Bush, who will step down  with one of the lowest public approval ratings of any   president in modern times -- in the mid-20 percent range.      In a final ceremony at the State Department earlier on  Thursday, Bush defended his foreign policy -- from the  unpopular war in Iraq to nuclear standoffs with Iran and North  Korea. 'We have made the world freer,' he said.      Bush touted security gains in Iraq as vindication for a  U.S. tr",

      "Text": "By Andrea TantarosRepublican Political Commentator/FOXNews.com Contributor\n\nAs I watched President George W. Bush say a final farewell to the nation last night, my emotions were mixed. Though I admired the humility of his speech, I was left to wonder where thatPresident Bush, and that tone, had been hiding for the last eight years. Mysteriously, there was no real acknowledgment of our current economic calamity, or at a minimum the reassurance that the situation was top of mind, and that he and President- elect Obama were working together to ensure a seamless hand off.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_5553\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"President George W. Bush gives a farewell address to the nation, Thursday, Jan. 15, 2009, in the East Room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Ron Edmonds)\"][/caption]\n\nWhile he still remains a somewhat popular figure in the Republican Party, Bush has angered many in the GOP, including me. That is not to say I don't respect my President. I do. But Bush and I have something in common: we both are always going to tell you exactly what we think, politically correct or not, no matter whom we tick off.\n\nPresident Bush will largely be known for two things: the decision to invade Iraq and for presiding over the largest and most dramatic expansion of government this country has ever seen, which is a long term threat to liberty.\n\nWhile his compassionate conservatism produced positive results like an unprecedented level of funding to combat AIDS in Africa, it also bought into the notion that it is the federal government's job to provide material success to people -- a terrible premise to operate from.\n\nOn foreign policy, he rightly supported Israel and refused to back down to radical Islamic jihadists. His tough-talkin' cavalier character put the fundamentalists who seek to destroy us on notice, but his second Inaugural was an ideological orgy promoting democracy. As someone who is conservative, I do not want the United States to be a crusader for democracy. That is Napoleonic.\n\nDomestically he saw successes with Medicare Part D and CAFTA, but the back story to each of these successes was filled with late night votes and congressional cloakroom arm twisting. Bush created a massive fault line in the Republican Party with his proposal for easy immigration, and by the time Hurricane Katrina rolled around it seemed as though he given up. He politicized his decision-making by having Karl Rove present in all his policy meetings and he put allegiance above ability when it came to selecting a staff whose modus operandi was insular, bullish, close-minded and off-putting. Sadly, this has left the Republican Party badly bruised, divided and disoriented.\n\nWhile he deserves enormous credit for keeping this country safe, his most overlooked achievements were his admirable positions on the judiciary and the social issues. He genuinely struggled to formulate an ethical position on stem cells. He picked outstanding justices and that is his biggest, untold legacy. He also picked a wife that could arguably be considered the most gracious and respected First Lady in United States' history. Moreover, as a person, he is a man of class and grace, a role model as a father and a man with a genuine conscience. It is hard not to admire him for that reason.\n\nWhen it comes to his legacy, President Bush deserves more credit than he will get, especially when it comes to the mainstream media. In order for Obama to be a success, they must paint Bush as a failure. However, no president is perfect. Bush's biggest downfall was not that his intentions were misguided, it was that he forgot how to communicate with the American people. The last week of one's presidency is a terrible time to remember.",

      "Text": " (Adds quotes after meeting with Talabani, reaction)      By Matt Spetalnick      BAGHDAD, Dec 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush  made a farewell visit to Baghdad on Sunday, flying in secret out  of Washington just weeks before he bequeaths the unpopular Iraq  war to President-elect Barack Obama.      Bush held talks with President Jalal Talabani and Prime  Minister Nuri al-Maliki, and was due to address U.S. troops. He  made a show of the improved security in Baghdad after five years  of sectarian bloodshed by landing in daylight and venturing out  beyond the heavily fortified international Green Zone.      Bush's visit was intended to thank U.S. troops for their  efforts and 'pat the Iraqis on the back for all they've  accomplished this last year', said General Douglas Lute, White  House coordinator for Iraq and Afghanistan.      Bush arrived first by helicopter at the presidential palace  for talks with Talabani and his two vice-presidents.      Talabani called Bush a great friend of the Iraqi people 'who  helped us to liberate our country and to reach this day, which  we have democracy, human rights, and prosperity gradually in our  country'. He said he hoped that friendship would continue when  Bush went back to Texas after leaving the presidency.      Bush's trip -- his fourth to Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led  invasion -- follows approval of a security pact between  Washington and Baghdad last month that paves the way for U.S.  forces to withdraw by the end of 2011.      Bush, beaming with obvious delight during the meeting with  Talabani, said he had come to herald the passage of the security  pact. 'And the work hasn't been easy, but it has been necessary  for American security, Iraqi hope, and world peace,' he said.      The pact has its critics in Iraq, who doubt the United  States will live up to its promise to leave Iraqi cities by the  end of June next year and withdraw completely by end-2011.      'We reject this visit, as it occurs at a time when Iraq is  still under the U.S. occupation and the U.S army has the upper  hand in controlling the security situation,' said Ahmed  al-Massoudi, a spokesman for the parliamentary bloc loyal to  anti-American Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.      'This visit is a show of force.'            SHOWCASE SECURITY GAINS      The brief visit was meant to showcase recent security gains  in Iraq but was also a stark reminder of how heavily the war  will weigh on the Republican president's foreign policy legacy.      Though Iraq has slipped down the list of Americans' concerns  as the recession-hit U.S. economy has taken center stage, polls  show most people think the war was a mistake.      It will now be left to Obama, a Democrat and early opponent  of U.S. military involvement in Iraq, to sort out an exit  strategy after he takes office on Jan. 20.      About 140,000 U.S. troops will still be in Iraq nearly six  years into a war that has killed more than 4,200 American  military personnel and tens of thousands of Iraqis.      Bush was greeted on the heavily guarded tarmac in Baghdad by  the top U.S. commander in Iraq, General Ray Odierno, and U.S.  Ambassador Ryan Crocker.      The decision to land in broad daylight reflected confidence  that Baghdad was more secure this time than in Bush's last visit  to the capital in 2006 when sectarian violence was raging.      Until Air Force One touched down, Bush's trip was conducted  in strictest secrecy. The presidential jet was rolled out",

      "Text": "    By William Schomberg and Matt Spetalnick      LJUBLJANA, June 10 (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush  goes into his farewell European summit on Tuesday seeking to  work with allies to ratchet up pressure on Iran over its nuclear  programme but still at odds with them over climate change.      Bush is due to meet European Commission President Jose  Manuel Barroso and Janez Jansa, prime minister of current  European Union president Slovenia, before he heads off to the  capitals of Europe's four biggest powers.      Washington and European governments have played down the  chance of dramatic announcements during the visit, which comes  in the twilight of a presidency marked by fierce opposition from  many Europeans to the U.S.-led war in Iraq.      Divisions over Iraq have eased somewhat, even as Europeans  look increasingly past Bush to his successor who will be chosen  in the November election.      Despite that, a draft of the summit statement obtained by  Reuters showed the United States and EU were ready to threaten  extra measures against Iran on top of U.N. sanctions if Tehran  keeps defying demands to suspend sensitive nuclear work.      The U.N. Security Council passed a third sanctions package  against Tehran in April, and Washington has pressed the EU to  deny some Iranian banks access to the world financial system.      EU diplomats have said recently the bloc was prepared to go  beyond the approved sanctions, citing previous travel bans and  asset freezes on Iranian officials.            MORE COOPERATIVE APPROACH      Bush, accused by critics of 'cowboy diplomacy' during much  of his presidency,' has tried to take a more cooperative  approach with allies in his second term. He hopes to forge a  foreign policy legacy defined by more than Iraq.      With low approval ratings at home, Bush acknowledges,  however, he is also unpopular in Europe. 'A lot of people like  America. They may not sometimes necessarily like the president,'  Bush told Slovenia's Pop TV before arriving in Ljubljana late on  Monday.      On climate change, EU policymakers say they have given up  trying to get Washington to join with the bloc in signing up now  for binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions.      U.S. officials insist that big developing nations such as  China and India have to make similar commitments for the United  States to join in too, and say Europeans hoping for big changes  with a new president will be disappointed.      'Barack Obama and John McCain are very close to the  positions of the administration and there is no difference with  the administration on the need to engage China,' the U.S. envoy  to the EU, C. Boyden Gray, told reporters.      But polls show Europeans are especially fond of Obama, a  Democrat who would be the first black U.S. president, for his  opposition to the Iraq war, which has frayed America's image.      Obama and McCain both win high marks in Europe for calling  for the closing of the Guantanamo military prison where  terrorism suspects are held. Bush says he wants to shut it down  too but only after other arrangements are made for detainees.            THE DOLLAR      Money matters will also figure in Bush's weeklong trip,  which will see stops in Germany, Italy, France and Britain.      He made clear before leaving Washington that he would press  his commitment to a 'strong dollar' -- its weakness is seen as a  barometer of the U.S. economic slowdown -- and his concern about  record oil prices.

      "Text": "    By William Schomberg      LJUBLJANA, June 9 (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush  begins a farewell tour of Europe on Monday when he arrives in  Slovenia for an U.S.-EU summit which is expected to gloss over  disputed issues such as climate change.      In a sign of waning ambitions before Bush leaves office, a  row over chicken carcasses is likely to vex transatlantic  advisers at the summit as much as higher profile issues.      The summit is the starting point for a visit which will also  take Bush to Germany, Italy, France and Britain - partners with  whom he has had mixed relations over the past eight years.      European Union officials say differences with Bush's  administration over greenhouse gas emissions are too big to  bother trying to broach yet again when leaders meet at the  summit on Tuesday, just months before Bush stands down.      On other issues such as the Middle East, differences have  been less acute since Bush began his second term, beset by  problems in Iraq following the 2003 invasion, and he has focused  more on cooperating with European allies.      In the absence of geopolitics, a decade-old trade row over  how to wash poultry meat has risen up the summit agenda.      The United States has expressed increasing frustration with  the EU's ban on imports of U.S. poultry, introduced in 1997 over  American producers' use of a low-concentration chlorine wash on  chickens, a practice that is not permitted in Europe.      The ban affects U.S. exports worth at most $300 million a  year, a small fraction of the world's biggest trade  relationship. But U.S. officials have taken it as the test of a  new body designed to smooth a broad range of transatlantic  business.      'Despite the frustrations on the poultry issue which will be  vented at the summit, both sides agree that the Transatlantic  Economic Council is far more important than just the poultry  issue,' an EU official told reporters.      The European Commission has proposed ending the ban, albeit  with strict conditions. But that plan was blocked last week by  national-level veterinary experts, dashing hopes in Brussels for  progress towards settling the dispute before the summit.            NO CHANGE ON CLIMATE      Brussels and Washington will talk about climate change on  Tuesday but they remain at odds over how to tackle the problem.      'The Bush administration is not on the same wavelength as  the EU about the seriousness of the climate change problem and  what to do about it,' the EU official said.      The EU is looking more for signs of what the next president  intends to do on emissions. But Europeans hoping that either  Barack Obama or John McCain will take a sharply new approach are  likely to be disappointed, a senior U.S. official said.      'I don't think they will find the next administration to be  very different on the fundamental disagreement ... the central  question of whether China and other advanced developing  countries need to make a commitment of some level.'      On Iran, Bush will be seeking assurances from the EU that it  will rigorously implement a set of sanctions approved by the  United Nations in April, the U.S. official said.      The EU hoped to persuade Washington to take a less sceptical  view of Syria's potential role in the Middle East peace process,  the EU official said.      The EU side will also renew calls on the United States to  move more quickly to relax visa requirements from citizens of  all EU count",

      "Text": "    By Matt Spetalnick and Oleg Shchedrov      SOCHI, Russia, April 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President George W.  Bush and Russia's Vladimir Putin will have one last chance on  Sunday to try to mend frayed relations face-to-face but with  little hope of resolving the biggest dispute that divides them.      In a farewell summit at the Russian president's Black Sea  holiday villa, the two leaders -- both in the twilight of their  terms -- will use their personal chemistry to try to bridge  differences that have driven ties to a post-Cold War low.      Bush will also hold his first substantive talks with Putin's  prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 and successor, Dmitry Medvedev, who will be sworn in as  president on May 7.      The summit opened on a positive note after Bush's arrival at  Putin's seaside retreat on Saturday as the two joined in a  Russian folk dance during an informal dinner of red caviar and  veal loin. But once the night's festive mood has worn off, the  leaders still face a long list of grievances.      The thorniest issue is Bush's plan for a U.S. missile shield  based in eastern Europe, a system Washington says is needed to  protect against Iran but Moscow says threatens its security.      After holding out hope a deal on missile defence might be  reached at Sochi, the White House all but ruled that out on the  eve of Sunday's formal talks.      'We're going to have to do more work after Sochi,' White  House spokeswoman Dana Perino said on the Bush's Air Force One  presidential jet as it headed to Russia. She called it  'premature' to predict a deal though negotiations over  compromise proposals were 'headed in the right direction'.      Despite that, Bush hopes to capitalise on a less strident  tone struck by Putin at a NATO summit in Bucharest last week,  where he attacked Western military expansion near Russia's  borders but also implored: 'Let's be friends, guys.'      The two men are expected to sign an agreement on the  'strategic framework' of U.S.-Russian relations, aimed at  encapsulating the legacy they will bequeath to their successors.            'HEART-TO-HEART'      Bush, who leaves office in January, was meeting the Russian  leader seven years after saying he had peered into Putin's soul  and trusted him. Critics had roundly mocked Bush as na\u00c3\u00afve.      Since then, disputes over Kosovo, missile defence and  Russia's rights records have led to talk of a Cold War-style  atmosphere.      Bush says he expects his last heads-of-state meeting with  Putin -- they have met more than 20 times before -- to be  another 'heart-to-heart.'      Showing their rapport was still intact, the two leaders  shared a hug as Bush arrived at Putin's compound and exchanged  jokes as they were briefed on plans for the 2014 Winter Olympic  Games in Sochi, Putin's pet project.      Bush is out to salvage a foreign policy record dominated by  the Iraq war, which has damaged U.S. credibility.      He is also struggling to stay relevant on the world stage  now that his economic stewardship is under fire and attention is  focused on whoever will succeed him in the White House.      For his part, Putin is looking for a smooth transition of  the presidency to Medvedev, elected in a landslide last month  after the Russian leader endorsed him.      Bush had a chance to start forging a bond with Medvedev over  dinner, and will hold separate talks with him on Sunday.      This may give Bush a chance to gauge how much power Putin,  who will become prime minister, will continu",

      "Text": " (Adds new Bush quote in paragraph 13)      By Matt Spetalnick      BAGHDAD, Dec 14 (Reuters) - An Iraqi reporter called U.S.  President George W. Bush a 'dog' and threw his shoes at him on  Sunday, sullying a farewell visit to Baghdad meant to mark  greater security in Iraq after years of bloodshed.      Just weeks before he bequeaths the unpopular Iraq war to  President-elect Barack Obama, Bush sought to underline improved  security by landing in daylight and venturing out beyond the  city's heavily fortified international Green Zone.      He declared the war 'not over' despite recent gains.      In a sign of lingering anger over the war that will define  the Republican president's foreign policy legacy, an Iraqi  journalist shouted in Arabic 'this is a goodbye kiss from the  Iraqi people, dog,' and hurled his shoes at Bush during a news  conference with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.      Throwing shoes at somebody is a supreme insult in the Middle  East. One of the shoes sailed over the president's head and  slammed into the wall behind him and he had to duck to miss the  other one. Maliki tried to block the second shoe with his arm.      'It's like going to a political rally and have people yell  at you. It's a way for people to draw attention,' Bush said. 'I  don't know what the guy's cause was. I didn't feel the least bit  threatened by it.'      The journalist was leapt on by Iraqi security officials and  U.S. secret service agents and dragged from the room screaming  and struggling.      Bush's fleeting visit to Baghdad was aimed at marking the  recent passage of a U.S.-Iraq security pact that paves the way  for U.S. troops to pull out of Iraqi cities by July next year  and withdraw completely by the end of 2011.      It was also meant to hail a recent sharp fall in the  sectarian violence and insurgency that raged after the 2003 U.S.  invasion to topple Saddam Hussein, and to show support for Iraqi  police and soldiers as they take on increasing responsibility.      Asked whether he had come to Iraq on a victory lap, Bush  said: 'No, I consider it an important step on the road toward an  Iraq that can sustain itself, govern itself and defend itself.'      'There's still more work to be done. The war is not over.'             PRAISE FOR BUSH      Bush thanked U.S. forces for their service in Iraq at a  rally of about 1,500 cheering troops inside Saddam's old al-Faw  palace at the sprawling U.S. military base of Camp Victory.      'The surge is one of the greatest successes in the history  of the U.S. military,' Bush said, referring to the decision to  send an additional 30,000 troops to Iraq last year.      Bush held talks with President Jalal Talabani and Maliki  during the visit. Talabani called Bush a great friend of the  Iraqi people 'who helped us to liberate our country.'      Maliki, who had a strained look on his face after the  shoe-throwing, praised Bush: 'You have stood by Iraq and the  Iraqi people for a very long time, starting with getting rid of  the dictatorship.'      The U.S.-Iraq security pact, which replaces a U.N. mandate  governing the presence of foreign troops, has its critics in  Iraq, some of whom doubt the United States will live up to its  promise to withdraw.      'We reject this visit, as it occurs at a time when Iraq is  still under the U.S. occupation and the U.S army has the upper  hand in controlling the security situation,' said Ahmed  al-Massoudi, a spokesman for the parliamentary bloc loyal ",

      "Text": " (In paragraphs 17 and 20, White House corrects comment to say  health care workers in Africa instead of Afghanistan)      By William Schomberg and Matt Spetalnick      LJUBLJANA, June 10 (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush  goes into his farewell European summit on Tuesday seeking to  work with allies to ratchet up pressure on Iran over its nuclear  programme but still at odds with them over climate change.      Bush is due to meet European Commission President Jose  Manuel Barroso and Janez Jansa, prime minister of current  European Union president Slovenia, before he heads off to the  capitals of Europe's four biggest powers.      Washington and European governments have played down the  chance of dramatic announcements during the visit, which comes  in the twilight of a presidency marked by fierce opposition from  many Europeans to the U.S.-led war in Iraq.      Divisions over Iraq have eased somewhat, even as Europeans  look increasingly past Bush to his successor who will be chosen  in the November election.      Despite that, a draft of the summit statement obtained by  Reuters showed the United States and EU were ready to threaten  extra measures against Iran on top of U.N. sanctions if Tehran  keeps defying demands to suspend sensitive nuclear work.      The U.N. Security Council passed a third sanctions package  against Tehran in April, and Washington has pressed the EU to  deny some Iranian banks access to the world financial system.      EU diplomats have said recently the bloc was prepared to go  beyond the approved sanctions, citing previous travel bans and  asset freezes on Iranian officials.            MORE COOPERATIVE APPROACH      Bush, accused by critics of 'cowboy diplomacy' during much  of his presidency, has tried to take a more cooperative approach  with allies in his second term. He hopes to forge a foreign  policy legacy defined by more than Iraq.      With low approval ratings at home, Bush acknowledges,  however, he is also unpopular in Europe. 'A lot of people like  America. They may not sometimes necessarily like the president,'  Bush told Slovenia's Pop TV before arriving in Ljubljana late on  Monday.      On climate change, EU policymakers say they have given up  trying to get Washington to join with the bloc in signing up now  for binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions.      U.S. officials insist that big developing nations such as  China and India have to make similar commitments for the United  States to join in too, and say Europeans hoping for big changes  with a new president will be disappointed.      'Barack Obama and John McCain are very close to the  positions of the administration and there is no difference with  the administration on the need to engage China,' the U.S. envoy  to the EU, C. Boyden Gray, told reporters.      But polls show Europeans are especially fond of Obama, a  Democrat who would be the first black U.S. president, for his  opposition to the Iraq war, which has frayed America's image.      Obama and McCain both win high marks in Europe for calling  for the closing of the Guantanamo military prison where  terrorism suspects are held. Bush says he wants to shut it down  too but only after other arrangements are made for detainees.            THE DOLLAR      Money matters will also figure in Bush's weeklong trip,  which will see stops in Germany, Italy, France and Britain.      He made clear before leaving Washington that he would press  his commitment to a 'strong dollar",

      "Text": " (Recasts)      By Matt Spetalnick      BAGHDAD, Dec 14 (Reuters) - An Iraqi reporter called U.S.  President George W. Bush a 'dog' and threw his shoes at him on  Sunday, sullying a farewell visit to Baghdad meant to mark  greater security in Iraq after years of bloodshed.      Just weeks before he bequeaths the unpopular Iraq war to  President-elect Barack Obama, Bush sought to underline improved  security by landing in daylight and venturing out beyond the  city's heavily fortified international Green Zone.      He declared the war 'not over' despite recent gains.      In a sign of lingering anger over the war that will define  the Republican president's foreign policy legacy, an Iraqi  journalist shouted in Arabic 'this is a goodbye kiss from the  Iraqi people, dog,' and hurled his shoes at Bush during a news  conference with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.      Throwing shoes at somebody is a supreme insult in the Middle  East. One of the shoes sailed over the president's head and  slammed into the wall behind him and he had to duck to miss the  other one. Maliki tried to block the second shoe with his arm.      'It's like going to a political rally and have people yell  at you. It's a way for people to draw attention,' Bush said. 'I  don't know what the guy's cause was. I didn't feel the least bit  threatened by it.'      The journalist was leapt on by Iraqi security officials and  U.S. secret service agents and dragged from the room screaming  and struggling.      Bush's fleeting visit to Baghdad was aimed at marking the  recent passage of a U.S.-Iraq security pact that paves the way  for U.S. troops to pull out of Iraqi cities by July next year  and withdraw completely by the end of 2011.      It was also meant to hail a recent sharp fall in the  sectarian violence and insurgency that raged after the 2003 U.S.  invasion to topple Saddam Hussein, and to show support for Iraqi  police and soldiers as they take on increasing responsibility.      Asked whether he had come to Iraq on a victory lap, Bush  said: 'No, I consider it an important step on the road toward an  Iraq that can sustain itself, govern itself and defend itself.'      'There's still more work to be done. The war is not over.'             PRAISE FOR BUSH      Bush held talks with President Jalal Talabani and Maliki at  the presidential palace.      Later, he thanked U.S. forces for their service in Iraq at a  rally of about 1,500 cheering troops inside Saddam's old al-Faw  palace at the sprawling U.S. military base of Camp Victory.      Talabani called Bush a great friend of the Iraqi people 'who  helped us to liberate our country.'      Maliki, who had a strained look on his face after the  shoe-throwing, praised Bush: 'You have stood by Iraq and the  Iraqi people for a very long time, starting with getting rid of  the dictatorship.'      The U.S.-Iraq security pact, which replaces a U.N. mandate  governing the presence of foreign troops, has its critics in  Iraq, some of whom doubt the United States will live up to its  promise to withdraw.      'We reject this visit, as it occurs at a time when Iraq is  still under the U.S. occupation and the U.S army has the upper  hand in controlling the security situation,' said Ahmed  al-Massoudi, a spokesman for the parliamentary bloc loyal to  anti-American Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.      'This visit is a show of force.'      Though Iraq has slipped down the list of Americans' concerns  as the recession-hit U.S. economy ",

      "Text": "    By Wangui Kanina       DAR ES SALAAM, Feb 15 (Reuters) - About 2,000 Muslims  marched through Tanzania's capital on Friday and burned U.S.  flags in protest against a visit by President George W. Bush.     Chanting 'Bush is an oil thief' and 'evil is not a foreign  policy', the demonstrators, some wearing traditional Muslim  dress including the Islamic women's black bui-bui, tried to  march from the city's centre to the U.S. embassy on its northern  outskirts.       They were diverted to open ground by a small force of police  but tore down U.S. flags erected for Bush's visit this weekend  and burned them. The police did not intervene and there was no  violence.       The protesters chanted 'Who is a terrorist? Bush.'       The demonstration, which began after Friday prayers, caused  a major traffic jam across the narrow Selander bridge leading  out of Dar es Salaam.       One of the march organisers, Sheikh Mussa Kundecha, told  Reuters: 'We will be the first to receive Bush by protesting  against him and cursing his visit.'      Bush is scheduled to arrive on Saturday night on the second  and longest leg of a five-nation African tour. Tanzania is  considered one of Africa's most stable and democratic nations  and President Jakaya Kikwete is a favourite of Washington.       But Muslims are angered by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,  by U.S. backing of an Ethiopian invasion of Somalia to help  defeat Islamists -- and the subsequent rendition of Muslim  suspects -- and by Tanzanian anti-terrorism laws which they say  discriminates against them.       The fortified U.S. embassy was moved to its current location  after the previous building was badly damaged in a 1998 bomb  blast linked to al Qaeda and coordinated with a devastating  attack on the American mission in neighbouring Kenya.

      "Text": "    GAZA, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Palestinian Islamist group Hamas on  Saturday dismissed U.S. President George W. Bush's upcoming  visit to the Middle East as a 'photo opportunity' and said he  was not welcome in the region.      Hamas, which seized control of the Gaza Strip in June and  opposes Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's bid to make peace  with Israel, said Bush's visit was aimed at shoring up support  for the Jewish state and its occupation of Palestinian land.      'Bush's visit is unwelcome because it aims to serve the  occupation and provide it with political and psychological  support,' Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said in a statement.      'The visit is nothing but a farewell visit to get some photo  opportunities as Bush prepares to leave the White House.'      Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Abbas agreed at a  conference in Annapolis, Maryland, in November to try to forge a  deal on Palestinian statehood by the time Bush leaves office in  early 2009.      Sceptics say the president's hands-off approach to Middle  East peacemaking during his almost seven years in office as well  as Hamas's control of Gaza undermine chances for a breakthrough.      Hoping to bolster fragile peace efforts, Bush will make his  first presidential visit to Israel and the West Bank next week.      Israel and its Western allies are trying to bolster Abbas  against his Hamas rivals and have shunned the Islamist group for  refusing to renounce violence and recognise the Jewish state.      Abu Zuhri said Bush's visit was meant to fuel internal  Palestinian divisions, and said the president's policies were  'completely biased' in favour of Israel.      Hamas seized control of Gaza after routing Abbas's Fatah  forces in June, prompting Abbas to sack a Hamas-led government  and appoint a new administration led by Western-educated Salam  Fayyad, paving the way for U.S. talks with Israel.      Fayyad told a Palestinian radio station on Saturday  Palestinians would press Bush on Israel's settlement activity --  an issue that has already soured talks and which Bush this week  called 'an impediment' to peace efforts.      Talks launched at Annapolis have faltered since Israel  announced plans to build hundreds of new homes on occupied land  -- a move the Palestinians say contravenes its obligations under  a 2003 U.S. peace 'road map'.      Israel argues the Palestinians have failed to meet their own  road map commitments on reining in militants.

Bush made an  unannounced visit to Afghanistan on Monday with assurances that  the United States will stand by the war-torn country despite a  transition of power at the White House.       Moving from one war zone to another, Bush flew secretly from  Baghdad to Kabul, landing under cover of darkness for talks with  Afghan President Hamid Karzai and meetings with U.S. troops  spearheading the fight against a resurgent Taliban.       'I want to be in Afghanistan to say thank you to President  Karzai and let the people of Afghanistan know that the United  States has stood with them and will stand with them,' Bush told  reporters before landing at Bagram Air Base outside the capital.      On his farewell visit to Baghdad on Sunday, meant to mark  greater security in Iraq after years of bloodshed, an Iraqi  reporter called Bush a 'dog' and threw his shoes at him.       After Air Force One touched down under heavy security, Bush  strode across the tarmac and into a giant tent where hundreds of  troops greeted him with raucous cheers as he thanked them for  their service. 'I am confident we will succeed in Afghanistan  because our cause is just,' he told them.       Bush, who has ordered a troop increase in Afghanistan,  appeared to lend tacit support to President-elect Barack Obama's  pledge to increase troop levels after he takes office on Jan. 20.       'I recognized that we needed more troops. President-elect  Obama is going to make decisions on troops. And we've been  calling on our NATO allies to put in more troops,' Bush said.       Obama has promised to make Afghanistan a higher priority,  saying the Bush administration has been too distracted by the  unpopular Iraq war to pay Afghanistan the attention it deserves.       Bush also said it was important for the United States to  keep working with Pakistan to pressure militants along its border  with Afghanistan. Osama bin Laden and his top al Qaeda lieuteants  are believed to be hiding out in the remote, lawless region.       'If Pakistan is a place from which people feel comfortable  attacking infrastructure, citizens, troops, it's going to make it  difficult to succeed in Afghanistan,' Bush said.       'The more we can get Pakistan and Afghanistan to cooperate,  the easier it will be to enforce that part of the border  regions,' Bush added.

      "Text": "    By Matt Spetalnick and Mohammed Assadi      RAMALLAH, West Bank, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Making his first  presidential visit to the occupied West Bank on Thursday,   George W. Bush passed potent symbols of the conflict he hopes to  solve -- Jewish settlements and Israel's imposing barrier.      On day two of a trip to Israel and the West Bank to try to  invigorate Middle East peace talks, Bush was forced by bad  weather to travel to a meeting with Palestinian President  Mahmoud Abbas by motorcade instead of helicopter.      The drive to the city of Ramallah took him past Israel's  towering concrete and barbed wire barrier, through a military  checkpoint and around craggy West Bank hills dotted with the  red-roofed houses of Jewish settlements -- highlighting some of  the thorniest problems facing peacemakers.      Bush and Abbas met at the presidential 'Muqata' compound --  spruced up with a fresh coat of paint -- which stirred memories  of late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who spent the last  three years of his life under siege there by Israeli forces.      Arafat came to embody the Palestinian struggle against  Israel but was reviled by Bush as an obstacle to peace. A  photograph of the leader in his trademark chequered kaffiyeh  hung above Bush as the U.S. president voiced confidence that a  deal to create a state of Palestine was in reach.      After the meeting, Bush's helicopter took off from a  re-paved parking lot next to Arafat's mausoleum -- which the  president bypassed. Snipers stood atop the muqata.      Many in Ramallah said Bush was biased in favour of Israel  and doubt he will press the Jewish state to halt settlement  activity in the West Bank and ease security restrictions they  say amount to collective punishment.      While echoing Israel's argument that military checkpoints  are needed to protect its citizens, Bush also acknowledged the  'massive frustrations' they cause Palestinians and joked about  his own journey to the West Bank.      'You'll be happy to hear that my motorcade of 45 cars was  able to make it through without being stopped but I'm not  exactly sure that's what happens to the average person,' he  said.      Ramallah, usually a bustling business hub, came to a  standstill for the visit -- the first by a sitting U.S.  president to the city about 20 km (12 miles) from downtown  Jerusalem.      Shops straddling the road to Abbas's compound closed and  pedestrians were banned from the streets, while hundreds of  armed Palestinian security officers patrolled key intersections.      Some locals complained about the disruption, especially  given scant hopes for the visit.      'His weapons are being used to kill our kids so he cannot be  an honest mediator,' said Abu Haitham, a father of eight who  sells spinach in Ramallah's market. 'I'm incurring losses  because of him.'      A devout Christian, Bush headed to Bethlehem to visit the  traditional birthplace of Jesus on Thursday.

      "Text": "    By Zoran Radosavljevic      ZAGREB, April 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush  visits Croatia on Friday as the West seeks to strengthen NATO's  presence in the Balkans around Serbia after Kosovo's  independence.      Bush will spend almost two days in Zagreb after visiting  Ukraine and attending a NATO summit in Bucharest, expected to  yield an invitation to join the alliance for Croatia and  possibly two more Balkan states, Macedonia and Albania.      Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said the length of  Bush's stay showed particular importance Washington attached to  the visit.      'President Bush is coming to celebrate what we expect will  be Croatia's invitation (to join NATO) and to recognise the hard  work Croatia has done,' U.S. Ambassador Robert Bradtke told  reporters in Zagreb on Tuesday.      'It should also show other countries in the region that if  they do the hard work in economic, political and military  reforms, the door to NATO is open,' he said.      An EU diplomat with extensive knowledge of the region, said  the visit had more important undertones.      'The NATO invite and the Bush visit are coordinated. This is  not because the West really cares so much about Croatia, but  because they are protectively creating a safety cordon around  Serbia and potential instability there,' the diplomat said.      Political analyst Zeljko Trkanjec said Washington obviously  aimed to put most of Serbia's neighbours under NATO's umbrella.      'This will put Serbia under pressure to turn to the West and  not Russia, and reduce possibilities for the spillover of any  crisis,' Trkanjec said.      Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in February,  reviving bitter anti-NATO feelings among Serbs. NATO bombed  parts of Serbia in 1999 to try to halt ethnic cleansing in  Kosovo.            PATH TO EU      Croatia hopes NATO could also boost its bid for European  Union membership -- which Zagreb expects around 2011 -- as was  the case with eight east European countries that joined the  alliance in 2002 and the EU two years later.      'The visit of the U.S. president is an honour for every  country, including Croatia. It will boost our image,' said  President Stjepan Mesic, who will host Bush and his wife Laura  at a dinner in the presidential palace in Zagreb.      On Saturday morning, Bush will address the Croatian public  at the historic St. Mark's square, which houses government and  parliament buildings.      He will later have lunch with Mesic, Prime Minister Ivo  Sanader and their counterparts from Macedonia and Albania.      But not all Zagreb residents were happy about the visit.      Citizens feared traffic jams and several local  anti-globalisation groups announced protest rallies in Zagreb.      And a busker who plays the guitar and sings near the  government building will be asked to move a few blocks away.      'It's a shame. I know quite a few American rock'n'roll songs  I could play for him,' said the man, who gave his name as Vlado.

      "Text": " (Adds quotes after meeting with Talabani, reaction)      By Matt Spetalnick      BAGHDAD, Dec 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush  made a farewell visit to Baghdad on Sunday, flying in secret out  of Washington just weeks before he bequeaths the unpopular Iraq  war to President-elect Barack Obama.      Bush held talks with President Jalal Talabani and Prime  Minister Nuri al-Maliki, and was due to address U.S. troops. He  made a show of the improved security in Baghdad after five years  of sectarian bloodshed by landing in daylight and venturing out  beyond the heavily fortified international Green Zone.      Bush's visit was intended to thank U.S. troops for their  efforts and 'pat the Iraqis on the back for all they've  accomplished this last year', said General Douglas Lute, White  House coordinator for Iraq and Afghanistan.      Bush arrived first by helicopter at the presidential palace  for talks with Talabani and his two vice-presidents.      Talabani called Bush a great friend of the Iraqi people 'who  helped us to liberate our country and to reach this day, which  we have democracy, human rights, and prosperity gradually in our  country'. He said he hoped that friendship would continue when  Bush went back to Texas after leaving the presidency.      Bush's trip -- his fourth to Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led  invasion -- follows approval of a security pact between  Washington and Baghdad last month that paves the way for U.S.  forces to withdraw by the end of 2011.      Bush, beaming with obvious delight during the meeting with  Talabani, said he had come to herald the passage of the security  pact. 'And the work hasn't been easy, but it has been necessary  for American security, Iraqi hope, and world peace,' he said.      The pact has its critics in Iraq, who doubt the United  States will live up to its promise to leave Iraqi cities by the  end of June next year and withdraw completely by end-2011.      'We reject this visit, as it occurs at a time when Iraq is  still under the U.S. occupation and the U.S army has the upper  hand in controlling the security situation,' said Ahmed  al-Massoudi, a spokesman for the parliamentary bloc loyal to  anti-American Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.      'This visit is a show of force.'            SHOWCASE SECURITY GAINS      The brief visit was meant to showcase recent security gains  in Iraq but was also a stark reminder of how heavily the war  will weigh on the Republican president's foreign policy legacy.      Though Iraq has slipped down the list of Americans' concerns  as the recession-hit U.S. economy has taken center stage, polls  show most people think the war was a mistake.      It will now be left to Obama, a Democrat and early opponent  of U.S. military involvement in Iraq, to sort out an exit  strategy after he takes office on Jan. 20.      About 140,000 U.S. troops will still be in Iraq nearly six  years into a war that has killed more than 4,200 American  military personnel and tens of thousands of Iraqis.      Bush was greeted on the heavily guarded tarmac in Baghdad by  the top U.S. commander in Iraq, General Ray Odierno, and U.S.  Ambassador Ryan Crocker.      The decision to land in broad daylight reflected confidence  that Baghdad was more secure this time than in Bush's last visit  to the capital in 2006 when sectarian violence was raging.      Until Air Force One touched down, Bush's trip was conducted  in strictest secrecy. The presidential jet was rolled out",

      "Text": "    By Matt Spetalnick      KABUL, June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. first lady Laura Bush made  an unannounced visit to Afghanistan on Sunday with an appeal to  the international community not to abandon the war-torn country  in the face of resurgent Taliban violence.      She flew into Kabul under tight security for an 8-1/2-hour  trip to a place that her husband, President George W. Bush, has  declared a main front in the battle against Muslim militants.      Mrs. Bush depicted her visit as a chance to showcase  'hopeful signs' of reconstruction and improved women's rights  since U.S.-led forces ousted the fundamentalist Taliban  government more than six years ago.      Another major thrust of her mission was to shore up the  international commitment to the country as Afghan, U.S. and  NATO forces struggle to contain a Taliban guerrilla war.      'We don't need to be intimidated by them,' Mrs. Bush,  making her third visit to Afghanistan, told reporters on her  plane heading for Kabul.      'The international community can't drop Afghanistan now at  this very crucial time,' she said.      It was important for the Afghan people to get the message  that 'the rest of the world is with you and that we're not  going to leave you right now when the Taliban and al Qaeda is  trying to intimidate you,' she said.      Washington, the biggest contributor to NATO's force in  Afghanistan, has met resistance from some of its European  allies to its calls to boost troop levels.      Aid donors have also become increasingly alarmed by rising  violence in the country, which over the past two years has been  the bloodiest since the Taliban's ouster.      Mindful of the Taliban threat, the White House kept a tight  lid of secrecy on Mrs. Bash's travels until the moment she  landed. Only then were journalists accompanying her allowed to  report her arrival.           MUCH TO BE DONE      Mrs. Bush said she hoped her visit would help her make the  case at an Afghan donors conference in Paris next week that the  international community 'needs to stay with Afghanistan.'      Some partners in Europe have been irked by the calls to do  more in a war they believe the United States neglected to focus  on Iraq. Bush's critics say Afghanistan is the more important  battle against Islamic militants.      The Taliban and their al Qaeda allies have vowed to step up  suicide bombings in an effort to wear down Western public  opinion about keeping international forces in Afghanistan.      Asked whether she was concerned that the international  community would abandon Afghanistan, Mrs. Bush said: 'I don't  think they will. I just don't want them to be discouraged.'      Her visit was to begin with a helicopter ride to Bamiyan  province, an impoverished region on the ancient Silk Road trade  route, to inspect a U.S.-funded road building project.      On the way, she was to get an aerial view of the ruins of  two ancient Buddha statues carved into a mountainside. The  Taliban drew international condemnation in 2001 when it blew  them up, considering them un-Islamic.      Mrs. Bush planned to meet women setting up their own  businesses, training as police officers and studying at  university -- activities forbidden to them under the Taliban.      She was to talk with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and  visit U.S. troops before heading for Slovenia, where she will  be joined by her husband on Monday at a U.S.-European summit.      Defending Karzai, she insisted it is was wrong to bl",

      "Text": "    By Tabassum Zakaria      JERUSALEM, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President George W.  Bush visits the Church of the Beatitudes on the shore of  the Sea of Galilee on Friday during a Holy Land visit aimed  at breathing life into Middle East peace talks.      After separate meetings with Palestinian President  Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud  Olmert in Jerusalem, Bush is leaving them with the message:  'now is the time to make difficult choices.'      His first visit to Israel and the West Bank in seven  years as president sought to create momentum towards  establishing a Palestinian state, after a November summit  in Annapolis, Maryland intended to jump-start peace talks.      The White House said he was likely to return to the  region before his term ends in January 2009.      The Church of the Beatitudes, a Catholic Franciscan  chapel, marks the spot where Jesus is believed to have  preached his Sermon on the Mount, laying out core teachings  and his call to 'turn the other cheek'.      The church's shape represents the sermon's eight  Beatitudes listed in the Gospel of Matthew, including  'Blessed are the peacemakers.'      Bush was also expected to visit the ruins of the  ancient city of Capernaum where Christians believe Jesus  performed miracles.      Bush said on Thursday he expected a treaty to be signed  before he leaves office.      'Achieving an agreement will require painful political  concessions by both sides,' he added.      He said the establishment of a Palestinian state was  'long overdue' and would improve regional stability.      'The peace agreement should happen, and can happen, by  the end of this year,' he said. 'I am committed to doing  all I can to achieve it.'            ARABS CAN 'REACH OUT'      Bush is scheduled to leave for Kuwait later on Friday  followed by visits to Arab allies in Bahrain, the United  Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.      He will ask them to support his Israeli-Palestinian  peacemaking efforts and to help curb the growing regional  influence of Iran.      'They can do a lot of things,' Bush said.      Arab allies could provide diplomatic support to Abbas,  give him greater financial support, and 'begin to reach out  to Israel and indicate in a tangible way that they support  this diplomatic process', he said.      Bush's efforts to curb Iran's growing influence comes  at a time of new U.S.-Iranian tensions over an incident  involving ships in the Strait of Hormuz.      The United States protested formally to the Iranian  government on Thursday over the incident, in which it says  Iranian speedboats aggressively approached U.S. Navy ships.      Bush warned Iran this week of 'serious consequences' if  it happened again and said all options were on the table.   (Editing by Andrew Roche)        Keywords: BUSH MIDEAST/       ",

      "Text": "   (Refiles to fix typo in paragraph 10)      By Matt Spetalnick      KABUL, June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. first lady Laura Bush made  an unannounced visit to Afghanistan on Sunday with an appeal to  the international community not to abandon the war-torn country  in the face of resurgent Taliban violence.      She flew into Kabul under tight security for an 8-1/2-hour  trip to a place that her husband, President George W. Bush, has  declared a main front in the battle against Muslim militants.      Mrs. Bush depicted her visit as a chance to showcase  'hopeful signs' of reconstruction and improved women's rights  since U.S.-led forces ousted the fundamentalist Taliban  government more than six years ago.      Another major thrust of her mission was to shore up the  international commitment to the country as Afghan, U.S. and  NATO forces struggle to contain a Taliban guerrilla war.      'We don't need to be intimidated by them,' Mrs. Bush,  making her third visit to Afghanistan, told reporters on her  plane heading for Kabul.      'The international community can't drop Afghanistan now at  this very crucial time,' she said.      It was important for the Afghan people to get the message  that 'the rest of the world is with you and that we're not  going to leave you right now when the Taliban and al Qaeda is  trying to intimidate you,' she said.      Washington, the biggest contributor to NATO's force in  Afghanistan, has met resistance from some of its European  allies to its calls to boost troop levels.      Aid donors have also become increasingly alarmed by rising  violence in the country, which over the past two years has been  the bloodiest since the Taliban's ouster.      Mindful of the Taliban threat, the White House kept a tight  lid of secrecy on Mrs. Bush's travels until the moment she  landed. Only then were journalists accompanying her allowed to  report her arrival.           MUCH TO BE DONE      Mrs. Bush said she hoped her visit would help her make the  case at an Afghan donors conference in Paris next week that the  international community 'needs to stay with Afghanistan.'      Some partners in Europe have been irked by the calls to do  more in a war they believe the United States neglected to focus  on Iraq. Bush's critics say Afghanistan is the more important  battle against Islamic militants.      The Taliban and their al Qaeda allies have vowed to step up  suicide bombings in an effort to wear down Western public  opinion about keeping international forces in Afghanistan.      Asked whether she was concerned that the international  community would abandon Afghanistan, Mrs. Bush said: 'I don't  think they will. I just don't want them to be discouraged.'      Her visit was to begin with a helicopter ride to Bamiyan  province, an impoverished region on the ancient Silk Road trade  route, to inspect a U.S.-funded road building project.      On the way, she was to get an aerial view of the ruins of  two ancient Buddha statues carved into a mountainside. The  Taliban drew international condemnation in 2001 when it blew  them up, considering them un-Islamic.      Mrs. Bush planned to meet women setting up their own  businesses, training as police officers and studying at  university -- activities forbidden to them under the Taliban.      She was to talk with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and  visit U.S. troops before heading for Slovenia, where she will  be joined by her husband on Monday at a U.S.-European summit.      Defending ",

After a brief stop in Kabul, Mrs. Bush boarded a helicopter  to the central town of Bamiyan, where in 2001 the Taliban blew up  two ancient giant statues of Buddha carved into a mountainside.      In the shadow of the now empty caves where the Buddhas once  stood, Mrs. Bush was met by New Zealand troops who performed the  traditional Maori haka dance, thrusting spears, and poking out  tongues as U.S. bodyguards looked on slightly nervously.      The New Zealand troops in Bamiyan form one of 26 Provincial  Reconstruction Teams across the country, units aimed at bringing  aid and development meant to undercut the insurgency.       But Bamiyan, one of the most peaceful places in Afghanistan,  has received much less aid than other provinces. The United  States and others have focused their assistance on the more  violent south where the Taliban insurgency is most virulent.            MORE TO BE DONE      Mrs. Bush visited a police academy in Bamiyan, the only one  of 34 Afghan provinces to have a female governor, and spoke to  around a dozen women police recruits. She is later due to  inaugurate a U.S.-funded road building project in the town.

      "Text": " (Adds details, background)      By Matt Spetalnick      BAGHDAD, Dec 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush  made an unannounced farewell visit to Baghdad on Sunday, just  weeks before he leaves office and bequeaths the unpopular Iraq  war to President-elect Barack Obama.      Slipping out of the White House over the weekend, Bush flew  secretly to the Iraqi capital to hold talks with Prime Minister  Nuri al-Maliki and address a rally of U.S. troops.      'Bush has come to meet Iraqi leaders, thank the troops and  celebrate the new security agreement,' a White House official  said.      Bush arrived first by helicopter at the presidential palace  for talks with President Jalal Talabani and his two  vice-presidents. He planned to meet later with Maliki.      Bush's trip -- his fourth to Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led  invasion -- follows approval of a security pact between  Washington and Baghdad last month that paves the way for U.S.  forces to withdraw by the end of 2011.       Bush was greeted on the heavily guarded tarmac in Baghdad  by General Raymond Odierno and Ambassador Ryan Crocker.      The decision to land in broad daylight reflected confidence  that Baghdad was more secure this time than during Bush's last  visit to the capital in 2006 when sectarian violence was raging.     Though Iraq has slipped down the list of Americans' concerns  as the recession-hit U.S. economy has taken center stage, polls  show most people think the war was a mistake.      It will now be left to Obama, a Democrat and early opponent  of U.S. military involvement in Iraq, to sort out an exit  strategy after he takes office on Jan. 20.      About 140,000 U.S. troops will still be in Iraq nearly six  years into a war that has killed more than 4,200 American  military personnel and tens of thousands of Iraqis.      Bush's visit, just 11 days before Christmas, was a final  chance for him to bid farewell to troops on the ground there.      Mindful of the threat still posed by militants, the White  House kept a tight lid of secrecy on Bush's trip before he  landed at Baghdad International Airport.      His movements were expected to be limited to the heavily  fortified sites in and around the Iraqi capital.      Bush was last in Iraq in September 2007, when he flew into a  U.S. air base in the restive Anbar province to underscore  improved security amid a 30,000-troop buildup and growing  support of Sunni tribal chiefs in the fight against al Qaeda.      Since then, there has been further progress in Baghdad and  elsewhere, and Iraqi security forces are increasingly taking  charge of policing streets and going after militants.            PULLOUT TIMETABLE      U.S. Gen. David Petraeus said last week that violence in  Iraq in the past few weeks had fallen to its lowest level since  mid-2003 and that security gains, while still at risk of  reversal, were less fragile than before. Car bombings and  suicide blasts are still common.      Bush will meet Maliki for the first time since the Iraqi  government won a key concession -- Washington's agreement on a  pullout timetable, something the U.S. president long opposed.      Obama pledged during the campaign to withdraw U.S. combat  troops in 16 months, which will now have to reconciled with the  timetable set in the new security deal.      As he prepares to step down, Bush has insisted toppling  Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was the right thing to do.      But he said in a recent ABC interview that the 'big",

Bush's visit, just 11 days before Christmas, was a final  chance for him to bid farewell to troops on the ground there.      He was greeted on the heavily guarded tarmac in Baghdad by  the top U.S. commander in Iraq, General Ray Odierno, and U.S.  Ambassador Ryan Crocker.      The decision to land in broad daylight reflected confidence  that Baghdad was more secure this time than in Bush's last visit  to the capital in 2006 when sectarian violence was raging.            'REGRET'      Until Air Force One touched down, Bush's trip was conducted  in strictest secrecy. The presidential jet was rolled out of its  giant hangar only after everyone was onboard. Journalists'  electronic devices, from cellphones to iPods, were confiscated  until mid-flight.      Bush, dressed casually and wearing a black baseball cap  after his night-time getaway from the White House, made a rare  appearance in the press cabin just before takeoff.      'Nobody knew who I was,' he joked when an aide complimented  him on his disguise.      His movements were expected to be limited to the heavily  fortified sites in and around the Iraqi capital.      Bush was last in Iraq in September 2007, when he flew into a  U.S. air base in the restive Anbar province to underscore  improved security amid a 30,000-troop build-up and growing  support of Sunni tribal chiefs in the fight against al Qaeda.      Since then, there has been further progress in Baghdad and  elsewhere, and Iraqi security forces are increasingly taking  charge of policing streets and going after militants.      U.S. General David Petraeus said last week that violence in  Iraq in the past few weeks had fallen to its lowest level since  mid-2003 and that security gains, while still at risk of  reversal, were less fragile than before. Car bombings and  suicide blasts are still common.      B",

      "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The Bush administration  explicitly endorsed the use of waterboarding and other harsh  interrogation methods against al Qaeda suspects in a pair of  secret memos to the CIA in 2003 and 2004, The Washington Post  reported on Wednesday.      The previously undisclosed classified memos were requested  by then CIA Director George Tenet more than a year after the  start of the secret interrogations, the newspaper reported,  citing administration and intelligence officials familiar with  the documents.      A White House spokesman had no comment on the report.      According the newspaper, intelligence officials sought  cover from the White House because they were worried about a  possible backlash if details of the interrogation program  became public.      Justice Department lawyers signed off on the the agency's  interrogation methods beginning in 2002, but senior CIA  officials were troubled that White House policymakers had never  endorsed the program in writing, the Post reported.      Repeated requests by the CIA chief for a paper trail  reflected growing worries within the agency that the  administration might later distance itself from decisions about  the handling of captured al Qaeda leaders, the Post said,  citing former intelligence officials who spoke on condition of  anonymity.      The officials told the newspaper Tenet first pressed the  White House for written approval in June 2003 during a meeting  with members of the National Security Council.      A few days later, Tenet received a brief memo conveying the  administration's approval for the CIA's interrogation methods,  the officials were cited as saying.      Tenet made a second request for written approval in June  2004, after the public outcry over the Abu Ghraib prison  scandal, the Post said.      Administration officials confirmed the existence of the  memos, but neither they nor former intelligence officers would  describe the still classified documents in detail, the  newspaper reported.

Bush on Saturday vetoed legislation passed by Congress that  would have banned the CIA from using waterboarding and other  controversial interrogation techniques.      Lawmakers included the anti-torture measure in a broader  bill authorizing U.S. intelligence activities.      'Because the danger remains, we need to ensure our  intelligence officials have all the tools they need to stop the  terrorists,' Bush said in his weekly radio address. He added  that the vetoed legislation 'would diminish these vital  tools.'      The House of Representatives approved the legislation in  December and the Senate passed it in February despite White  House warnings it would be vetoed.      CIA Director Michael Hayden told Congress last month that  government interrogators used waterboarding on three suspects  captured after the Sept. 11 attacks.      The simulated drowning technique has been condemned by many  members of Congress, human rights groups and other countries as  a form of illegal torture.      The U.S. Army Field Manual prohibits waterboarding and  seven other interrogation methods and the bill would have  aligned CIA practices with the military's.      In a message to CIA employees on Saturday after Bush's  veto, Hayden said the CIA would continue to work strictly  within the law but said its needs were different from that of  the U.S. Army and that the CIA needed to follow its own  procedures.      'There are methods in CIA's program that have been briefed  to our oversight committees, are fully consistent with the  Geneva Convention and current U.S. law, and are most certainly  not torture,' Hayden said.      In his remarks, Bush did not specifically mention  waterboarding.      But he said: 'The bill Congress sent me would not simply  ban one particular interrogation method, as some have implied.   Instead, it would eliminate all the alternative procedures  we've developed to question the world's most dangerous and  violent terrorists.'      It is unlikely that Democrats, the majority party in  Congress, could muster enough votes to overturn Bush's veto.  The bill passed the House and Senate on partisan votes, short  of the support needed to reverse the president.

      "Text": "    NEW YORK, May 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ordered the  Central Intelligence Agency on Thursday to submit to the court  a 2002 memo said to specify harsh interrogation methods used on  suspected terrorists held abroad.      The American Civil Liberties Union said the memo was  written by the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel  and sent to the CIA in August 2002. The ACLU described the memo  as 'one of the most important torture documents still being  withheld by the Bush administration.'      In a copy of the order posted on the ACLU's Web site, Judge  Alvin Hellerstein told the government to produce the memo so he  can determine whether it should be made public as part of a  lawsuit the ACLU and other organizations filed in June 2004  requesting records concerning the treatment of prisoners in  U.S. custody abroad.      Hellerstein has scheduled a review of the document for  Monday.      'This memo authorized the CIA to use specific torture  techniques -- including waterboarding,' Jameel Jaffer, ACLU's  national security project director, said in a statement.      'CIA agents waterboarded prisoners because this memo told  them that they could,' he said. 'The memo is being withheld not  for legitimate security reasons, but in order to protect  government officials from accountability for their decisions.'      Waterboarding is a simulated drowning technique.      The ACLU said more than 100,000 pages of government  documents have been released in response to its lawsuit.      Among those was a declassified 2003 memo, released by the  U.S. Justice Department on April 1, that justified the use of  harsh interrogation methods for suspected terrorists held  abroad.      A subsequent decision overruled the memo, which said  President George W. Bush's authority as commander-in-chief  superseded international law regarding wartime interrogations.      The U.S. military has banned the use of waterboarding and  other harsh methods considered by some rights advocates to be  torture. The U.S. intelligence community has not.      Bush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding after the  Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, but he has repeatedly insisted that  the United States does not torture prisoners.      The CIA has said it used waterboarding during the  interrogations of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who faces murder  charges in the U.S. military court at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

      "Text": " (Adds reaction, analysis)      By Andy Sullivan      WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - President-elect Barack Obama  has chosen former White House chief of staff Leon Panetta to  lead the CIA, which has been widely criticized for harsh  interrogation of terrorism suspects, Democratic officials said  on Monday.      The surprise pick of Panetta for Central Intelligence  Agency director was one of the last major nominations for the  incoming Obama administration, which takes over from President  George W. Bush on Jan. 20.      Panetta has relatively little experience in national  security matters, though he did participate in daily  intelligence briefings with President Bill Clinton when he  served as Clinton's chief of staff between 1994 and 1997.      He is best known as a budget expert who tamed deficits in  the White House and during a prior 16-year stint in Congress.      He was a member of the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan  commission that was charged with assessing a way to end the  Iraq war. Its recommendations for a phased troop withdrawal  were largely ignored by the Bush administration, which chose to  increase the U.S. military presence there instead.      Intelligence experts said Panetta's knowledge of the inner  workings of government, and his strong bipartisan reputation  for fairness, would prove valuable.      'It was a surprise, but I think he will prove to be a  valuable pick,' said a source with close ties to U.S.  intelligence.      Panetta would succeed Michael Hayden, who has been  criticized by some Democrats and human rights groups for his  defense of Bush administration counterterrorism tactics. Hayden  has sought to restore stability at the spy agency.        CIA CONTROVERSIES      The CIA has been at the center of a number of major  controversies during Bush's presidency, beginning with the  intelligence failures before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and  then the faulty prewar intelligence about Iraq's weapons  programs.      The agency also has been criticized for the use of  waterboarding, or simulated drowning, and other harsh  interrogation methods on al Qaeda suspects, for the secret  transfer of captured terrorism suspects to countries known to  use torture and for the use of secret prisons overseas for  high-level captives.      Obama has vowed to 'put a clear end to torture' and restore  a balance between security and constitutional protections.      'The CIA still is in a politically fragile moment,' said  Princeton professor Julian Zelizer. 'Bringing a politically  skilled person into this position can help the CIA revitalize  its political standing.'      The position of CIA director is not as influential as it  used to be after the creation in 2004 of a Director of National  Intelligence to oversee all U.S. intelligence agencies.      Sources say Obama has picked retired Navy Adm. Dennis Blair  to fill that position.      After leaving the White House, Panetta has directed a  public policy center at California State University, Monterey  and served in other positions within California's state  university system. He has also sat on a number of corporate and  nonprofit boards.      Panetta's choice could appease some liberal activists who  have said that Obama's other picks for key national-security  posts are too hawkish and insufficiently antiwar.      Obama has picked retired Marine Gen. James Jones for his  national security adviser and has asked current Defense  Secretary Robert Gates to remain in c",

      "Text": "    By Alonso Soto      QUITO, April 5 (Reuters) - Ecuador's leftist president on  Saturday accused the CIA of controlling many of his country's  spy agencies and said it had shared Ecuadorean intelligence  with U.S. ally Colombia during last month's regional crisis.      'Many of our intelligence agencies have been taken over by  the CIA,' Rafael Correa said during his weekly radio show.  'Through the CIA, information found here was passed to Colombia  to improve their position' in the dispute.      Ecuador broke off diplomatic ties with Bogota after  Colombian forces attacked a rebel camp inside Ecuadorean  territory, killing a top guerrilla leader and more than 20  other people.      The bombing raid raised the specter of war after Ecuador  and Venezuela briefly sent troops to their borders with  Colombia. Nerves quickly calmed during a regional meeting.      But the recent confirmation that an Ecuadorean died in the  March 1 raid has renewed tensions between the neighbors.      Correa charged the United States with financing some  officers in the Ecuadorean spy agencies and said reforms to the  Andean country's intelligence were needed.      A close ally of U.S. foe Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez,  Correa said he hoped the diplomatic spat would be over soon,  but warned of legal actions against Colombia for the killing of  the Ecuadorean citizen who was in the rebel camp.      Correa added that Ecuador's decision on to sue Colombia in  international court over Colombia's anti-drug spraying along  its border was in retaliation for the raid.      The suit filed on Monday has again strained relations  between the neighbors who share a 400-mile (600 km) border  often crossed by rebels fighting a four-decade war against the  Colombian government.      Correa, whose popularity has rebounded for his handling of  the dispute, is a critic of U.S. foreign policy in Latin  America.      He has said U.S. President George W. Bush was worse than  Satan and once vowed to cut off his arm before renewing a lease  that allows U.S. troops to use a key anti-drug air base.

      "Text": "    NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - Recent letters from the  Justice Department to Congress state that U.S. intelligence  agents working to prevent terror attacks can legally use  interrogation techniques banned by international law, The New  York Times reported on Sunday.      President George W. Bush issued an executive order last  summer in which he said the CIA would observe international  regulations regarding detainee treatment. The letters indicate  the Bush administration now contends these boundaries may be  stretched in some interrogations.      A March 5 letter from the Justice Dept. to Congress makes  clear the Bush administration has not defined which  interrogation methods might violate the Geneva Convention's  bans on 'outrages upon personal dignity,' the Times said.      The letters were provided by the staff of Sen. Ron Wyden,  an Oregon Democrat and member of the Senate Intelligence  Committee. The panel received classified briefings on the  matter and Wyden requested further information, which yielded  the letters, the Times said.      'The fact that an act is undertaken to prevent a threatened  terrorist attack, rather than for the purpose of humiliation or  abuse, would be relevant to a reasonable observer in measuring  the outrageousness of the act,' wrote Brian Benczkowski, a  deputy assistant attorney general, in one letter.      A senior Justice Department official, speaking on condition  of anonymity, said of the classified information: 'I certainly  don't want to suggest that if there's a good purpose you can  head off and humiliate someone.'      But, he said, 'the fact that you are doing something for a  legitimate security purpose would be relevant ... There are  certainly things that can be insulting that would not raise to  the level of an outrage on personal dignity.'      The Geneva Conventions prohibit humiliating and degrading  treatment of prisoners.

President Rafael Correa has fired a top intelligence  officer and plans to overhaul spy agencies for belatedly  informing him about links between Colombian rebels and an  Ecuadorean who died in Colombia's raid inside Ecuador last  month that sparked a regional crisis.      'Many of our intelligence agencies have been taken over by  the CIA,' the leftist leader said during his weekly radio show.  'Through the CIA, information found here was passed to Colombia  to improve their position' in the dispute.      Correa also charged the United States with financing some  officers in the Ecuadorean spy agencies.      U.S. Embassy spokesman in Quito Arnaldo Arbesu declined to  comment on the charges but said, 'We are always willing to work  with the Ecuadorean government in any type of issue.'      Correa, whose popularity has rebounded for his handling of  the dispute and is an ally of U.S. foe Venezuelan leader Hugo  Chavez, is a critic of U.S. foreign policy in Latin America.      He has called U.S. President George W. Bush worse than  Satan, and once vowed to cut off his own arm before renewing a  lease that allows U.S. troops to use a key anti-drug air base.      The March 1 raid, which killed a Colombian rebel leader and  more than 20 other people, raised the threat of war after  Ecuador and Venezuela briefly sent troops to their borders with  Colombia. Nerves quickly calmed during a regional meeting a  week later.      Correa said he hoped the diplomatic spat would be over  soon, but warned of legal actions against Colombia for the  killing of the Ecuadorean citizen who was in the rebel camp.      Correa added that Ecuador's decision to sue Colombia in  international court over Colombia's anti-drug spraying along  its border was in response to the raid.      The suit filed on Monday has once again strained relations  between the neighbors who share a 400-mile (600-km) border  often crossed by rebels fighting a four-decade war against the  Colombian government.

      "Text": " (Adds Hayden quote, comments by FBI, national intelligence  director, background)      By Randall Mikkelsen      WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The CIA used a widely  condemned interrogation technique known as waterboarding on  three suspects captured after the Sept. 11 attacks, CIA  Director Michael Hayden told Congress on Tuesday.      'Waterboarding has been used on only three detainees,'  Hayden told the Senate Intelligence Committee. It was the first  time a U.S. official publicly specified the number of people  subjected to waterboarding and named them.      Critics call waterboarding a form of illegal torture.  Congress is considering banning the technique.      Those subjected to waterboarding were suspected Sept. 11  mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and senior al Qaeda leaders  Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, Hayden said at the  hearing on threats to the United States.      He said waterboarding has not been used in five years.      'The circumstances are different than they were in late  2001, early 2002,' Hayden said. 'Very critical to those  circumstances was the belief that additional catastrophic  attacks against the homeland were imminent. In addition to  that, my agency ... had limited knowledge about al Qaeda and  its workings. Those two realities have changed.'      Hayden told reporters later that the interrogations of  Mohammed and Zubaydah were particularly fruitful.      From the time of their capture in 2002 and 2003 until they  were delivered to Guantanamo Bay prison in 2006, the two  suspects accounted for one-fourth of the human intelligence  reports on al Qaeda, Hayden said.      Some analysts have questioned Mohammed's credibility under  interrogation. But Hayden said most of the information was  reliable and helped lead to other al Qaeda suspects.      He told the committee he opposed limiting the CIA to using  interrogation techniques permitted in the U.S. Army Field  Manual, which bans waterboarding. CIA interrogators are better  trained, and the agency works with a narrower range of suspects  in its interrogations, he said.           HARSH TACTICS      Hayden said fewer than 100 people had been held in the  CIA's terrorism detention and interrogation program launched  after the Sept. 11 attacks, with fewer than one-third of them  subjected to any harsh interrogation techniques.      But applying the field manual's limitations to the CIA, he  said, 'would substantially increase the danger to America.'      The CIA is the only U.S. agency that uses harsh  interrogation techniques, National Intelligence Director  Michael McConnell told the hearing. The entire military adheres  to the Army Field Manual and FBI Director Robert Mueller told  the hearing his agency does not use coercive techniques.      A senior intelligence official said after the hearing that  it was unclear whether the CIA could legally use waterboarding  in the future, given changes in U.S. law. The Bush  administration says it neither uses nor condones torture.      The CIA said in December that it had destroyed videotapes  depicting the interrogations of Zubaydah and Nashiri, prompting  a Justice Department investigation.

      "Text": " (Adds Sen. Durbin, Human Rights Watch)      By Randall Mikkelsen      WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The CIA used a widely  condemned interrogation technique known as waterboarding on  three suspects captured after the Sept. 11 attacks, CIA  Director Michael Hayden told Congress on Tuesday.      'Waterboarding has been used on only three detainees,'  Hayden told the Senate Intelligence Committee. It was the first  time a U.S. official publicly specified the number of people  subjected to waterboarding and named them.      Congress is considering banning the simulated drowning  technique. A Democratic senator and a human rights advocacy  group urged a criminal investigation after Hayden made his  remarks.      'Waterboarding is torture, and torture is a crime,' Human  Rights Watch said in a statement.      Those subjected to waterboarding were suspected Sept. 11  mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and senior al Qaeda leaders  Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, Hayden said at the  Senate hearing on threats to the United States.      He said waterboarding has not been used in five years.      'The circumstances under which we are operating ... are  frankly, different than they were in late 2001 and early 2002,'  Hayden said. 'Very critical to those circumstances was the  belief that additional catastrophic attacks against the  homeland were imminent. In addition to that, my agency ... had  limited knowledge about al Qaeda and its workings. Those two  realities have changed.'      Hayden told reporters later that the interrogations of  Mohammed and Zubaydah were particularly fruitful.      From the time of their capture in 2002 and 2003 until they  were delivered to Guantanamo Bay prison in 2006, the two  suspects accounted for one-fourth of the human intelligence  reports on al Qaeda, Hayden said.      Some analysts have questioned Mohammed's credibility under  interrogation. But Hayden said most of the information was  reliable and helped lead to other al Qaeda suspects.      He told the committee he opposed limiting the CIA to using  interrogation techniques permitted in the U.S. Army Field  Manual, which bans waterboarding. CIA interrogators are better  trained, and the agency works with a narrower range of suspects  in its interrogations, he said.           HARSH TACTICS      Hayden said fewer than 100 people had been held in the  CIA's terrorism detention and interrogation program launched  after the Sept. 11 attacks, with fewer than one-third of them  subjected to any harsh interrogation techniques.      But applying the field manual's limitations to the CIA, he  said, 'would substantially increase the danger to America.'      The CIA is the only U.S. agency that uses harsh  interrogation techniques, National Intelligence Director  Michael McConnell told the hearing. The entire military adheres  to the Army Field Manual and FBI Director Robert Mueller told  the hearing his agency does not use coercive techniques.      A senior intelligence official said after the hearing that  it was unclear whether the CIA could legally use waterboarding  in the future, given changes in U.S. law. The Bush  administration says it neither uses nor condones torture.      Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and judiciary  committee member, demanded that Attorney General Michael  Mukasey investigate the CIA waterboarding and vowed to delay  the nomination for Mukasey's deputy until the attorney general  responds to that and other issues.

      "Text": " (Adds additional background)      By Andy Sullivan      WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - President-elect Barack Obama  has chosen former White House chief of staff Leon Panetta to  lead the CIA, which has been widely criticized for harsh  interrogation of terrorism suspects, Democratic officials said  on Monday.      The choice of Panetta for Central Intelligence Agency   director was one of the last major nominations for the incoming  Obama administration, which takes over from President George W.  Bush on Jan. 20.      Panetta has relatively little experience in national  security matters. He is best known for imposing order on  President Bill Clinton's White House during his 1994-1997 stint  as chief of staff and taming budget deficits while there and  during his prior 16-year tenure in Congress.      He was a member of the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan  commission that was charged with assessing a way to end the  Iraq war. Its recommendations for a phased troop withdrawal  were largely ignored by the Bush administration, which chose to  increase the U.S. military presence there instead.      Panetta would succeed Michael Hayden, who has been  criticized by some Democrats and human rights groups for his  defense of Bush administration counterterrorism tactics. Hayden  has sought to restore stability at the spy agency.      The CIA has been at the center of a number of major  controversies during Bush's presidency, beginning with the  intelligence failures before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and  then the faulty prewar intelligence about Iraq's weapons  programs.      The CIA also has been criticized for the use of harsh  interrogation methods, including waterboarding, on al Qaeda  suspects, for the secret transfer of captured terrorism  suspects to countries known to use torture and for the use of  secret prisons overseas for high-level captives.      Obama has vowed to 'put a clear end to torture' and  'restore' a balance between security and constitutional  protections.      After leaving the White House, Panetta has directed a  public policy center at California State University, Monterey  and served in other positions within California's state  university system. He has also sat on a number of corporate and  nonprofit boards.      Panetta's choice could appease some liberal activists who  have said that Obama's other picks for key national-security  posts are too hawkish and insufficiently antiwar.      Sources say Obama has named retired Navy Adm. Dennis Blair  to be the top U.S. intelligence official, who would oversee the  CIA and other arms of the U.S. intelligence apparatus.      He has also picked retired Marine Gen. James Jones to be  national security adviser and has asked current Defense  Secretary Robert Gates to remain in charge at the Pentagon.

      "Text": "    By Randall Mikkelsen      WASHINGTON, May 16 (Reuters) - The FBI is helping to get  information from detainees and prepare terrorism cases against  suspects at Guantanamo Bay, despite differences with the CIA  over harsh interrogation techniques, the bureau's director said  on Friday.      But, in an appearance at the National Press Club, Federal  Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller declined to say  whether a single U.S. interrogation standard was needed to  prohibit coercive tactics like waterboarding, a form of  simulated drowning widely criticized as torture.      'The policy of the bureau ... is not to use coercion,' he  said. 'I will speak for the FBI.'      Mueller spoke before the release of a Justice Department  inspector general's report on the FBI's role in harsh  questioning of detainees, which is expected as early as  Tuesday. A U.S. military commission is also preparing to try  several terrorism suspects held at the U.S. Naval Base on  Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.      Mueller was asked whether the FBI was still interrogating  'enemy combatants' in cases of suspected terrorism and at what  point agents would leave the room to avoid taking part in  coercive techniques.      'We still are participating in the preparation of cases in  Guantanamo, and yes we are participating in debriefings  elsewhere in the world, but I'm not going to get into details,'  he said.      FBI agents are known to have objected to the questioning of  detainees at Guantanamo, but critics say they should have  sought to stop abuses.      President George W. Bush vetoed a bill in March that would  have banned waterboarding by the CIA.      At a congressional hearing in February, CIA Director  Michael Hayden acknowledged that three foreign terrorism  suspects had been subjected to waterboarding five years  earlier. The technique was used under the agency's detention  and interrogation program launched after the Sept. 11.      Mueller told the same hearing the FBI did not use coercion,  and Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell said  the CIA was the only U.S. agency that uses harsh techniques.      Hayden said the CIA's questioning sought to uncover  impending attacks, unlike the FBI's job before the Sept. 11  attacks, which was to gather evidence of past crimes.      FBI spokesman Richard Kolko said the bureau works with  other U.S. intelligence agencies but follows its own  guidelines. 'In coordination with our intelligence community  partners, and in accordance with those guidelines and policies,  the FBI conducts interviews of potential terrorism subjects in  different locations,' he said.

But the spy chiefs must help decide how to  replace it and how to revise detention and interrogation  practices in keeping with Obama's vows for more humane  policies.           CATCHING OSAMA BIN LADEN - Officials of the outgoing Bush  administration say with growing confidence that al Qaeda's  central leadership has been largely neutralized. But bin Laden  and his second-in-command, Ayman al Zawahri, remain at large  more than seven years after the Sept. 11 attacks they  masterminded.           MONITORING IRAN - U.S. spy agencies shifted gears in  December 2007 with a national intelligence estimate that  concluded Iran had stopped developing a nuclear warhead. Some  critics of Iran said the report understated its threat and  undermined a U.S.-led international campaign against Iran's  nuclear program. Congress and others will be watching closely  to see whether any new intelligence merits updating the  estimate.          SECURITY OVERHAUL - Blair and two other intended senior  members of Obama's security team have served on the Project for  National Security Reform, which last November released a  500-page blueprint for overhauling the U.S. security system  across government, and they are likely to bring those ideas  with them. Among the recommendations are to combine the White  House National Security Council and Homeland Security Council,  which the Obama team is known to be considering.           WORKING TOGETHER - The Office of the Director of National  Intelligence -- created in response to intelligence failures  that contributed to the Sept. 11 attacks and Iraq war -- is  relatively new and assumes some duties once held by the CIA.  The effectiveness of the two agencies depends on a strong  working relationship, but how to ensure that and prevent  rivalries is still being worked out.

      "Text": "    By Randall Mikkelsen      WASHINGTON, July 16 (Reuters) - The White House threatened  to veto legislation on Wednesday that would bar CIA contractors  from interrogating suspected terrorists, in the latest debate  over treatment of detainees in the U.S.-declared war on  terrorism.      The White House issued the threat in a notice to Congress  as the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives began  considering a broad measure to authorize funding of U.S.  intelligence activities for the 2009 fiscal year.      The Bush administration also objected to several other  provisions in the multibillion-dollar bill.      They include the establishment of an inspector general with  authority over all federal intelligence agencies and  requirements that the president give Congress more sensitive  national security information.      In addition to such oversight measures, the bill also would  increase funding for intelligence agents and to monitor issues  in Asia, Africa and Latin America.      The bill contains many provisions 'that conflict with the  conduct of intelligence activities,' the White House budget  office told Congress. 'If (the bill) were presented to the  president, the president's senior advisors would recommend that  he veto the bill.'      The contractor provision was the first objection listed by  the White House.      CIA Director Michael Hayden has acknowledged that outside  contractors were used to conduct some interrogations in the  agency's detention program for suspected terrorists, which has  been widely condemned for harsh techniques that critics say  amount to torture.      He told Congress in February he believed contractors helped  conduct 'waterboarding,' the fiercely condemned simulated  drowning technique that he acknowledged using on three al Qaeda  suspects.      Critics say the use of outside contractors could allow the  CIA to dodge accountability for abuses, but the agency has said  contractors are subject to the same laws as agency staffers.      'Our bill will take detention-related activities out of the  hands of private contractors and put the responsibility back  where it belongs, in the hands of authorized government  personnel,' U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, a California Democrat,  said shortly before the House Intelligence Committee passed the  authorization measure in May.      The panel passed the bill on a voice vote with broad  bipartisan support.      But the White House said prohibiting contract interrogators  could deprive the program of necessary questioning skills and  expertise.      'Such a provision would unduly limit the United States'  ability to obtain intelligence needed to protect Americans from  attack,' it said.      The Senate Intelligence Committee passed in May its version  the bill, which also contains a ban on CIA interrogation  contractors. It also would ban CIA harsh interrogations and  require that the Red Cross be granted access to all detainees.      The measure awaits action by the full Senate. Differences  between the House and Senate versions would have be resolved  before any final measure is passed.      Major funding provisions of the intelligence bill are  classified. Last year the the administration bowed to a law  ordering disclosure of the annual intelligence budget and said  it had spent $43.5 billion in fiscal 2007. The law also  requires disclosure of spending in fiscal 2008, which ends in  September, but the U.S. president can waive the requirement  after",

      "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The CIA on three occasions  shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks used a widely condemned  interrogation technique known as waterboarding, CIA Director  Michael Hayden told Congress on Tuesday.      'Waterboarding has been used on only three detainees,'  Hayden told the Senate Intelligence Committee, publicly  specifying the number of subjects and naming them for the first  time, as Congress considers banning the technique.      Those subjected to waterboarding were al Qaeda suspects  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim  al-Nashiri, Hayden said.      He said waterboarding has not been used in five years, but  it was used then because of concerns of imminent catastrophic  attacks on the United States and because authorities had  limited knowledge of al Qaeda.      'The circumstances are different than they were in late  2001, early 2002,' Hayden said.      He said he opposed limiting the CIA to using interrogation  techniques permitted in the U.S. Army Field Manual, which bans  waterboarding. CIA interrogators are better trained, and it  works with a narrower range of suspects in its interrogations,  he said.      Hayden told the committee fewer than 100 people had been  held in the CIA's terrorism detention and interrogation  program, with fewer than one-third of them subjected to any  coercive interrogation techniques.      The CIA said in December that it had destroyed videotapes  depicting the interrogations of Zubaydah and Nashiri, prompting  a Justice Department investigation.

It's your chance to call in and argue with John!\n\nToday John Kerry weighed in on an issue that is now all the rage among liberal politicians. The issue is called the Fairness Doctrine.\n\nThis is a rule that used to exist in broadcasting \u2014 radio and TV \u2014 which required that no opinion could be expressed without a countervailing opinion presented immediately. It was the old salt and pepper rule. If you were on the air with a salt shaker, you had to have a pepper shaker.\n\nNow what this is all about is talk radio. Liberals are complaining that their brand of talk radio fails whenever someone tries to put it on the air, and they have decided the answer is to shut up conservative talk radio. This is the \"Hush Rush\" movement.\n\nLiberals are angry that so many of you listen to talk radio \u2014 conservative talk radio \u2014 and that you cannot be dragged over to a liberal talk show. This argument ignores the fact that something like 20 million people a week listen to NPR, which is the very definition of liberal.\n\nWhat it also ignores is that the Fairness Doctrine applies to all broadcast, not just radio and especially not just talk radio. Liberals should be on notice it will apply to all the liberals who now operate on the airwaves in network TV news, in certain quarters of cable news and, of course, in entertainment TV.\n\nFace it. Liberals own Hollywood. Virtually every movie would be subject to the Fairness Doctrine. Think Al Gore's \"Inconvenient Truth\" could stand up to that scrutiny or Michael Moore's \"Fahrenheit 9/11\"? Not a chance.\n\nDo you think HBO can stand to have the Fairness Doctrine applied to what it airs? Bill Maher is going to have an awful time trying to conform to the Fairness Doctrine, and I can't think of a liberal anywhere who wants to shut him up.\n\nWhat John Kerry and Dianne Feinstein and Dick Durbin are asking for is to only restrict the broadcasting that conservatives do, mainly talk radio, though I have no doubt they have their plans for FOX News, too.\n\nThis is an attempt to take over the airwaves with liberal thought and make sure nothing else gets on. It's already a huge imbalance in favor of liberal thought on the airwaves, and the effort now is to make certain that echo chamber of so-called progressives is undisturbed by any irritating arguments from the right, or debates liberals can't win.\n\nThis is liberals in action. When you can't win the debate, make certain there is no debate. That is what the resurgence of the Fairness Doctrine debate is all about.\n\nThat's My Word.\n\nWatch John Gibson weekdays at 5 p.m. ET on \"The Big Story\" and send your comments to: myword@foxnews.com\n\nRead Your Word",

      "Text": "    By Kim Dixon      WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate passed an  amendment on Thursday that would bar regulators from requiring  broadcasters to give equal time to all points of view, a ban  strongly supported by some Republican lawmakers.      The legislative amendment, sponsored by Republican Sen. Jim  DeMint of South Carolina, would prevent the Federal  Communications Commission from reimposing the so-called  Fairness Doctrine to all broadcasters. It was repealed more  than 20 years ago.      Aides to President Barack Obama have said he has no  intention of trying to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine, but  that has not stopped some Republicans from raising the issue.      Free Press, a media advocacy group that opposes bringing  back the rule, said the issue was a distraction.      'An uncharitable interpretation is that they (Republicans)  need an issue that unites their base and is an easy talking  point for conservative radio,' said Ben Scott, policy director  at Free Press.      Conservative talk show icon Rush Limbaugh recently decried  the doctrine in a Wall Street Journal editorial.      DeMint said the doctrine violates the First Amendment and  would suppress free speech by letting the government decide  what is fair political dialogue.      An appeals court made that ruling, leading the FCC to  repeal it in 1987.      Scott's group agrees the government should not be decided  what is fair and balanced, but said there is no clamor to bring  it back.      The amendment was attached to an unrelated bill on voting  rights for Washington, D.C. residents. Whether it will survive  in the U.S. House of Representatives is uncertain.

      "Text": "First radio, now the Web?\n\nMedia analysts and bloggers are warning that fresh efforts to bring back the so-called Fairness Doctrine could go too far, following a report that one prominent Democrat is looking into ways to apply the media control standards to the Internet.\n\nThe Fairness Doctrine is a policy created decades ago but abolished in the late 1980s that required broadcasters to provide opposing views on controversial issues.\n\nWhile some Democrats have talked about reviving the policy, The American Spectator reported Monday that Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., is taking the call to a new level. The article said aides to the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee met last week with Federal Communications Commission staff to discuss ways to not only enact those policies but give Waxman's panel greater oversight over the Internet.\n\n\"It's all about diversity in media,\" the Spectator quoted a House energy committee staff member as saying. \"Does one radio station or one station group control four of the five most powerful outlets in one community? ... Does one heavily trafficked Internet site present one side of an issue and not link to sites that present alternative views?\"\n\nThe committee vigorously denied the report. A spokesperson called the account \"fictitious\" in a statement to FOX News.\n\n\"The American Spectator report is false and was written without any documentation or attribution,\" the statement said.\n\nFCC spokesman David Fiske also disputed the claims in the piece, saying, \"We're not sure that it's an accurate article.\"\n\nAnalysts treated the report with a dose of skepticism as well -- but noted that the idea is not entirely foreign. Robert McDowell, the current FCC commissioner and a Bush appointee, warned in an interview last year that Fairness Doctrine advocates might try to extend their policies to the Web.\n\nIf that is the case, foes and supporters of the doctrine alike say policing fairness on the Internet will prove impossible. Plus they say it's unnecessary and well beyond the scope of the original policy.\n\n\"This borders between stupidity and sheer insanity,\" said conservative radio talk show host Mike Gallagher, when told about the Spectator report. \"I can't wait until they try to monitor how many conservative posts are on a thread versus how many liberal posts are on a thread.\"\n\nHe added that Democrats would be only neutralizing dominant liberal blogs that currently help them. He predicted any move to extend Fairness Doctrine principles to the Web would \"blow sky high.\"\n\nThe Fairness Doctrine was adopted in 1949 and held that broadcasters were obligated to provide opposing points of views on controversial issues of national importance. It was halted under the Reagan administration.\n\nThe policy is the scourge of conservative radio hosts, who say it would allow the federal government to skew content on their programs. Democratic lawmakers, some of whom have renewed the call to reinstate the doctrine in recent weeks, say it would bring accountability to the airwaves and help increase the number of liberal shows in a landscape dominated by conservatives like Rush Limbaugh.\n\nSteve Rendall, a Fairness Doctrine supporter and senior analyst with Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, said liberals and conservatives both over-state the impact the doctrine would have on media content.\n\nHe said most talk shows, even those on the right, already comply with the requirements, which he said tread \"very lightly\" and do not call for absolute balance on the airwaves.\n\nBut he said there is \"no justification\" for applying the doctrine to the Internet, or any other form of media -- since the doctrine was only meant to apply standards to the privileged holders of limited broadcast licenses. The Internet, by contrast, has infinite outlets for opinion.\n\n\"Cable and Internet are, at least theoretically, limitless in the number of voices that they can present, and it's not at all the same as broadcast,\" Rendall said.\n\nBrent Bozell, president of the conservative Media Research Center, said it would be \"impossible\" to regulate balance and neutrality on the Internet. He said he thinks Democrats eventually want to bring those standards to the Web but are struggling to rally the political will to revisit the Fairness Doctrine.\n\nHe said any legislative efforts to reinstate it will probably occur behind closed doors, since doing it out in the open could cause political repercussions.\n\nThe Spectator reported that Waxman's advisers were discussing ways to implement Fairness Doctrine policies without actually calling it the \"Fairness Doctrine.\"\n\nOther Democrats have openly called for a modern-day Fairness Doctrine in recent weeks, though they were referring more to radio than the Internet.\n\n\"I absolutely think it's time to be bringing accountability to the airwaves,\" Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., told liberal radio host Bill Press two weeks ago. She said she expects hearings soon on reviving the policy, though her office has reportedly backed off that prediction. (Stabenow's husband, Tom Athans, is and has been an executive at several liberal radio talk groups.)\n\nAnd Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, told Press last week: \"We gotta get the Fairness Doctrine back in law again.\"\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, a spokesman said then-candidate Barack Obama did not favor reinstating the Fairness Doctrine. But Obama's White House aides are now leaving open the question.\n\nAsked if the White House would rule out imposing the doctrine on \"FOX News Sunday,\" senior adviser David Axelrod ducked.\n\n\"I'm going to leave that issue to Julius Genachowski, our new head of the FCC ... and the president to discuss. So I don't have an answer for you now,\" he said.\n\nDespite the speculation, nobody has introduced a bill this session to reinstate those policies.\n\nMeanwhile, Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe introduced a bill this year to prevent reinstatement of the Fairness Doctrine.\n\nFOXNews.com's Judson Berger and FOX News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",

      "Text": "    By Paul Taylor, European Affairs Editor      BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - As the Soviet empire began to  crumble in 1989, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's spokesman  coined the phrase 'the Sinatra doctrine' to describe the process  of each nation going its own way.      'The days of the Brezhnev doctrine are over,' Gennady  Gerassimov said, referring to former leader Leonid Brezhnev's  iron rule that no communist state could leave the fold. 'We now  follow the Frank Sinatra doctrine: I'll do it my way.'      The European Union has struggled to overcome an outbreak of  the 'Sinatra doctrine' since the global financial crisis swept  into Europe from the United States last month, felling giant  banks, rattling markets and panicking savers.      Each country began by acting for itself, some taking  measures with negative consequences for neighbours or partners.      The Irish enacted an unlimited guarantee for deposits in  Irish-owned banks, sucking cash away from British rivals.  National regulators and governments in various countries banned  some or all short-selling of shares.      The Dutch and Italians called for a U.S.-style bank rescue  fund for Europe. France canvassed the idea privately, then  disowned it when Germany objected loudly.      French President Nicolas Sarkozy, holder of the 27-nation  bloc's revolving presidency, tried to assert leadership,  convening a summit of leaders of the major European economies  and EU institutions who pledged to coordinate their response.      That irked smaller EU states which felt excluded without  immediately instilling much more discipline.      The very next day, German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a  blanket guarantee of savers' deposits apparently without having  informed EU partners or the European Commission in advance.            RENATIONALISATION?      By this week, European Commission President Jose Manuel  Barroso was warning: 'A succession of national responses may  cause the renationalisation of the European financial system,  which would be a setback for European integration.'      He rejected accusations that the Commission, seen by some  critics as a slave to free-market dogma, had failed to press for  greater European regulation of banks and markets.      'We all know that before this crisis there was no chance to  introduce more European regulation. Some of the most relevant  member states in economic and financial dimension would not ever  have accepted it,' he told the Friends of Europe think-tank.      Behind the finger-pointing is fear in Brussels of a rise of  protectionism and disregard for EU competition rules that could  wreak economic damage and lead to big gains for Eurosceptics in  next year's European Parliament elections.      Another casualty could be governments' willingness to adopt  ambitious but initially costly measures to fight climate change  and promote renewable energy, due to be enacted this year.      Public anger at bankers' excesses and fear for savings, jobs  and pensions may fuel support for the anti-globalisation left  and the nationalist right, while disenchanted mainstream voters  stay home.      'No' votes in 2005 to the EU constitution in France and the  Netherlands, and Ireland's rejection this year of the Lisbon  treaty containing the same reforms were warning signs.      'We will have a very, very tough election campaign because  the Eurosceptics ... are coming together. From Ireland to  Denmark, Austria and other countries,' ",

      "Text": "    LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Canadian journalist Naomi Klein  has won Britain's inaugural Warwick Prize for Writing for 'The  Shock Doctrine', her acclaimed investigation into neoliberal  economics which she calls 'disaster capitalism'.      The 2007 book argues that governments and companies use  natural disasters like the Asian tsunami or man-made shocks like  the Iraq war or the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, to push through  corporate-friendly policies.      'The Shock Doctrine is a brilliant, provocative,  outstandingly written investigation into some of the great  outrages of our time,' said fantasy fiction author China  Mieville who chaired the judging panel.      Klein receives 50,000 pounds ($73,000) for winning the  biennial award, which is funded by the University of Warwick and  honours any 'substantial' piece of writing in the English  language, including works in translation.      'At a time when the news out of the publishing industry is  usually so bleak, it's thrilling to be part of a bold new prize  supporting writing, especially alongside such an exciting array  of other books,' Klein said in a statement.      Klein was up against 'Montano's Malady' by Spanish writer  Enrique Vila-Matas, Polish-born Lisa Appignanesi for 'Mad, Bad,  and Sad: A History of Women and the Mind Doctors from 1800' and  U.S. novelist Francisco Goldman for 'The Art of Political  Murder: Who Killed Bishop Gerardi?'.      Rounding off the shortlist of six were U.S. theoretical  biologist Stuart Kauffman ('Reinventing the Sacred: A New View  of Science, Reason, and Religion') and U.S. music critic Alex  Ross ('The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century').

      "Text": "    NEW DELHI, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The son of a wealthy Indian  arms dealer, whose drunken driving killed six people a decade  ago, was jailed for five years on Friday in a case seen as a test  of Indian courts' fairness in judging the rich and powerful.      Sanjeev Nanda, the grandson of a former navy chief, pleaded  innocent in the case that saw the convict's family being accused  of trying to bribe witnesses into lying.      The media kept up pressure on the high-profile case in a  country where the judiciary is often accused of favouring the  wealthy and powerful.      'I found Sanjeev Nanda guilty,' judge Vinod Kumar said,  sentencing him to five years in prison.      The court also jailed three other defendants for six months  to a year on charges of destroying evidence in the case which  came to be known as the BMW case after the car Nanda was driving.      Nanda's lawyer said they would appeal before a higher court  within a week.      Prosecutors said Nanda, who was a student of the Wharton  School of Business and on holiday in India, was returning from a  party with two friends when he ran over seven people. Six,  including three policemen, were killed.   (Reporting by R.

      "Text": "    TEHRAN, Nov 21 (Reuters) - The head of the U.N. nuclear  watchdog Mohamed ElBaradei should report on Iran's nuclear  programme neutrally and with fairness, an influential cleric  said on Friday after this week's report on Iran's atomic work.      Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, also a former president, said in a  sermon to worshippers at Friday prayers broadcast on state radio  that U.S. accusations that Iran was diverting its nuclear  programme to military purposes were not backed up by evidence.      Washington and its allies accuse Tehran of seeking to build  nuclear warheads under cover of a civilian atomic programme, a  charge Iran denies, insisting its aim is to generate electricity  so it can save more of its vast oil and gas reserves for export.      'We have announced everything. The (International Atomic  Energy) Agency (IAEA) has acknowledged ... that we have had no  diversion,' Rafsanjani said.      'But the Americans have raised a claim that we are not  announcing everything. Well, a claim of this nature has no  limits in scope and anybody can make such a claim in relation to  anything. They are not giving any document to support their  claim.'      The IAEA presented its latest report on Iran on Wednesday,  saying the Islamic Republic planned to start installing another  3,000 centrifuges early next year, adding to 3,800 already  enriching uranium and another 2,200 being gradually introduced.      The West worries about the enrichment programme because it  can have both civilian and military uses.       'As for Mr ElBaradei, whenever he speaks he does it  equivocally ... (saying) that, for instance, Iran is not letting  the agency inspect the Arak heavy water facility,' he said,  referring to one of Iran's disputed nuclear sites.      'This is again an example of trying to use compulsion in  relations to us. We ask the agency to judge neutrally and fairly  and avoid speaking equivocally,' the former president said.      'We will not let the certain right of a revolutionary and  innocent nation be trampled,' Rafsanjani added.      The IAEA has been investigating allegations that Iran  carried out research into nuclear warheads. The accusations were  based on intelligence which came from a laptop computer spirited  out of Iran by a defector in 2004 and passed on to Washington,  from some other Western states, and from IAEA inquiries.      Iran dismisses the allegations and says U.N. inspectors have  access in line with legal requirements to verify what it says is  the peaceful nature of the Islamic Republic's plans.

      "Text": "     Sept 12 (Reuters) - Republican vice presidential candidate  Sarah Palin, a little-known Alaska governor before becoming  John McCain's running mate in the Nov. 4 U.S. presidential  election, has begun to outline her foreign policy views.      Following are some of the positions she took in a series of  interviews with ABC News this week.           * On Iran and Israel:      'I believe that under the leadership of (Iranian President  Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad, nuclear weapons in the hands of his  government are extremely dangerous to everyone on this globe,  yes.'      'We have got to make sure that these weapons of mass  destruction, that nuclear weapons are not given to those hands  of Ahmadinejad, not that he would use them, but that he would  allow terrorists to be able to use them. So we have got to put  the pressure on Iran and we have got to count on our allies to  help us, diplomatic pressure.'      Asked whether it would be acceptable for Israel, if it felt  threatened, to take military action against Iran's nuclear  facilities, Palin said: 'We cannot second-guess the steps that  Israel has to take to defend itself.'           * On the 'Bush doctrine':      Asked if she agreed with the 'Bush doctrine,' Palin paused  and then asked, 'In what respect?'      Asked what she interpreted the Bush doctrine to be, she  replied, 'His world view.'      When the interviewer explained he was referring to the  doctrine Bush enunciated in September 2002 before the Iraq war,  Palin said:      'I believe that what President Bush has attempted to do is  rid this world of Islamic extremism, terrorists who are hell  bent on destroying our nation.'      When the interviewer defined the doctrine as U.S. President  George W. Bush's belief the United States has a right to make  pre-emptive strikes against countries that may attack it, Palin  said: 'If there is legitimate and enough intelligence that  tells us that a strike is imminent against American people, we  have every right to defend our country. In fact, the president  has the obligation, the duty to defend.'           * On the pursuit of al Qaeda/Taliban into Pakistan:      Asked if the United States had the right to make  cross-border attacks into Pakistan from Afghanistan without the  approval of the Pakistani government, Palin said:      'As for our right to invade, we're going to work with these  countries, building new relationships, working with existing  allies, but forging new, also, in order to, Charlie, get to a  point in this world where war is not going to be a first  option. In fact, war has got to be, a military strike, a last  option.'           * Pressed on whether the United States had the right to  make such cross-border attacks without approval, Palin said:      'In order to stop Islamic extremists, those terrorists who  would seek to destroy America and our allies, we must do  whatever it takes and we must not blink.'      'I believe that America has to exercise all options in  order to stop the terrorists who are hell-bent on destroying  America and our allies. We have got to have all options out  there on the table.'           * On the Russia-Georgia war:      Asked if the United States should try to restore Georgian  sovereignty over South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Palin said:      'We're going to continue good relations with (Georgian  President Mikheil) Saakashvili there. I was able to speak with  him the other day and giving him my commitment, as John  McCain's running ma",

      "Text": "    By Felix Onuah      ABUJA, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Most Nigerians question whether  the country can hold free and fair elections in an atmosphere of  political violence, vote-rigging and lax federal oversight, the  head of the election reform panel said on Tuesday.      Muhammadu Uwais, a former chief justice, said the government  must do more to ensure electoral bodies are independent enough  to conduct federal and state elections.      'Nigerians now express deep frustration over the lack of  credibility of the electoral process and their inability to  elect leaders of their choice,' he said after a meeting with  President Umaru Yar'Adua.      Yar'Adua, whose own electoral victory more than a year ago  is being challenged in court over alleged fraud, set up an  election reform panel in August 2007 shortly after he took  office.      The 21-member committee was charged with providing a report  to Yar'Adua by the end of August, but the president extended the  deadline on Tuesday to the end of the year.      The panel requested more time to digest all the suggestions  from public hearings on how to improve the electoral process.      Nigeria, a country of 140 million people and Africa's  biggest oil producer, returned to civilian rule in 1999 after  three decades of almost continuous military dictatorship.      Uwais said the committee would recommend that elections be  raised to international standards, the electoral body be made  autonomous, and the performance of political parties improved.      In setting up the committee last year, Yar'Adua noted that  almost every election since 1959 vote that ushered in  independence had been followed by controversy, which threatened  political stability and development.      Nigeria is one of the world's most corrupt countries,  according to independent watchdog Transparency International,  and public office is mostly seen as an avenue to personal  wealth.      Pro-democracy campaigners say politicians stop at almost  nothing to win office and get their slice of the cake.

      "Text": "  (Repeats to additional subscribers, text unchanged)      MOSCOW, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A top Russian general on Friday  said Poland's deal with the United States to set up parts of a  missile defence shield on Polish territory lays it open to a  possible military strike, a Russian news agency reported.      Col-General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, deputy chief of the general  staff, told Interfax that Russian military doctrine would allow  for a possible nuclear strike.      Poland agreed on Thursday to host elements of a U.S. global  anti-missile system after Washington agreed to boost Poland's  own military air defences.      'The USA is engaged in an anti-missile defence for its own  government, and not for Poland. And Poland, in deploying  (elements of the system) opens itself to a military strike. That  is 100 percent,' Interfax quoted Nogovitsyn as saying.      Nogovitsyn said Russia allows nuclear weapons to be used in  circumstances defined by its current security doctrine.      The Russian government revamped its national security  doctrine in 2000, broadening the range of conflicts in which  nuclear weapons could be used.      'It is written clearly: We will use it in instances against  governments that have nuclear weapons; against allies of  countries with nuclear weapons, if they somehow enable them,' he  said.      Washington says the missile system is aimed at protecting  the United States and its allies from long-range missiles that  could in the future be fired by Iran or groups such as al Qaeda.      The Kremlin has long said that was untrue, and has opposed  the shield as a threat to Russia. The 10 interceptor missiles to  be based at a site in northern Poland compare with Russia's own  nuclear arsenal of more than 5,000 ballistic warheads.      In agreeing to deploy elements of the U.S. missile shield,  Poland 'becomes an actionable object. Those targets are  destroyed in the first order,' Nogovitsyn said.      Tension between Moscow and Washington has risen in the past  week, since Georgia's attempt to re-take its separatist region  of South Ossetia by force provoked a massive counter-attack by  Russia.

      "Text": "    By David Brunnstrom      LUXEMBOURG, June 17 (Reuters) - Turkey said on Tuesday it  expected France, long an opponent of Turkish EU membership, to  treat its entry negotiations fairly and openly during its  six-month presidency beginning next month.      At a Luxembourg accession conference, Turkey and the EU  opened two new 'chapters', covering company law and intellectual  property rights, bringing the total under discussion to eight of  35. Ankara, if successful in the slow-moving negotiations, is  not expected to join until 2015 at earliest.      Turkey's progress over the last three years has been  hindered by French resistance, disputes with EU member Cyprus,  EU concerns over human rights in Turkey and the perception in  Europe that Turkey is slow to put reforms into practice.      Turkey's chief EU negotiator, Foreign Minister Ali Babacan,  told a news conference after the talks in Luxembourg that Turkey  expected the EU to honour its commitments and open chapters with  Turkey once it met technical requirements.     'We expect that the French presidency will be a fair,  impartial and transparent presidency as we have been told on  various occasions. We believe our EU accession process will be  further advanced during the French presidency.'      Babacan reiterated complaints that Turkey's progress was  being held up by 'political' considerations of some EU states.            PARTNERSHIP?      'We would like to think that negotiations can advance in  line with the technical readiness of Turkey,' he said.      European Commission Director-General Michael Leigh said the  EU executive was ready to open seven more chapters with Turkey  -- in areas ranging from food safety to social policy -- as soon  as the country met the benchmarks required.      'I expect that during coming months, further progress can be  made,' he told the news conference.      To the annoyance of Ankara and many EU capitals, France  wants to restrict talks to those chapters which could be used as  the basis of a future 'privileged partnership', short of  membership. Turkey rejects any notion of such a 'partnership'.      The European Commission has called on Turkey to implement  stalled reforms on state aid, decentralisation, ombudsman law  and upgrading the powers of the Court of Auditors.      A bid by prosecutors to shut down the ruling AK Party for  alleged Islamist activities is seen casting further political  uncertainty over the accession process.       Opponents to Turkish membership argue that the vast country  would be a drain on EU finances, that as a Muslim nation it  could not integrate well with mainstream European culture, or  that its human rights policies are far short of requirements.      Ankara argues it has a fast growing economy with a young  population and that its cultural and religious roots, tempered  by a strong Western orientation, would allow it to act as a  bridge to the Muslim world.

      "Text": "    By Michael Georgy      JOHANNESBURG, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Intimidation of Angola's  opposition and meddling in the country's electoral commission  threaten chances of a fair vote in the September parliamentary  election, Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday.      It is the first national vote for 16 years in Angola, which  is booming because of soaring oil revenues and recovery from  civil war. Angola wants the vote to set an example on the  continent after flawed polls in Kenya and Zimbabwe.      But Human Rights Watch said in a report that conditions  ahead of the Sept. 5 election did not point to a fair ballot.      'The conditions for free and fair elections start long  before election day,' said Georgette Gagnon, Africa director at  New York-based Human Rights Watch, in a report.      'Less than a month before elections, it's clear Angolans  aren't able to campaign free from intimidation or pressure. And  unless things change now, Angolans won't be able to cast their  votes freely.'      The official campaign kicked off on Aug. 5 with 10 parties  and four coalitions competing for votes. Each party will be  given five minutes of television time each day and 10 minutes on  the radio to lure voters.      A total of 5,198 candidates will fight for 220 parliamentary  seats in a country that rivals Nigeria as Africa's biggest oil  producer, but where two-thirds of the population live on less  than $2 a day.      Based on missions to Luanda and four provinces, Human Rights  Watch said Angola's government is 'failing to fully ensure the  right to free elections, and other rights critical to a fair  poll, including the freedoms of expression and of assembly'.            SECURITY CONCERNS      'Major areas of concern include the government's obligations  to safeguard freedom of assembly and expression and access to  the media by all stakeholders, and to establish an impartial  national electoral body,' it said.      'The government has also failed to provide adequate security  to political parties participating in elections and to ensure  political tolerance and full participation of citizens.'      Angola's government denies accusations of rights abuses.      In a rare radio address this month, dos Santos appealed to  all political parties to maintain the peace as the country  recovers from the 27-year civil war that ended in 2002. he  called for an election that is an example to the world.      On Monday, Angolan police detained 13 people campaigning for  the main UNITA opposition party in the Rangel area outside the  capital Luanda, Catholic Radio Ecclesia reported.      Police told the radio they were accused of holding a rally  without notifying authorities and for disrupting traffic.      Many political observers say UNITA, a former guerrilla  movement, is unlikely to unseat dos Santos's ruling MPLA, which  holds 129 seats out of 220. UNITA has 70 seats.      The parliamentary poll will be followed by a presidential  election in 2009. Dos Santos, who has ruled since 1979, is  expected to run.      The European Union has sent 90 election observers to Angola  and other missions are expected.

      "Text": "    NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - John Lennon's sons and widow,  Yoko Ono, on Monday lost a battle to block the use of the song  'Imagine' in the documentary 'Expelled: No Intelligence  allowed.'      Ono, her son Sean Ono Lennon, and Julian Lennon, John  Lennon's son from his first marriage, along with privately held  publisher EMI Blackwood Music Inc filed suit in April in  Manhattan federal court seeking to bar the filmmakers and their  distributors from continuing to use 'Imagine' in the movie.      They said the film, which looks at alleged discrimination  against scientists and teachers who support so-called  intelligent design as an alternative to Darwin's theory of  evolution, used the song without their permission.      But on Monday U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein found in  favor of the filmmakers based on a 'fair use' doctrine. 'That  doctrine provides that the fair use of a copyrighted work for  purposes of criticism and commentary is not an infringement of  copyright,' the judge said.      The documentary features Ben Stein, an actor, comedian and  former speechwriter for President Richard Nixon.      The suit, which sought unspecified damages, named the  film's producers and distributors -- Premise Media Corporation,  C&S Production LP and Rocky Mountain Pictures.      Lennon recorded 'Imagine' in 1971 and in 2004, Rolling  Stone magazine ranked it No. 3 on their list of the 500  Greatest Songs of All Time, according to the lawsuit.

      "Text": "To watch \"the memo\" click here.\n\nHi, I'm Bill O'Reilly. Thank you for watching us tonight.\n\nWe would like to welcome our new viewers in south Florida on the Adelphia Cable System. We hope you like The Factor.\n\nThe Talking Points Memo this evening is a No Spin look at the Rosie O'Donnell gay adoption controversy. Let's take it step by step.\n\nThe primary objection to gay adoption is that it goes against nature, and that's true. Nature dictates that the primary caregivers for children should be a man and a woman, the people who created the child. That situation is undeniable.\n\nAlso undeniable is that homosexuality is an aberration, a departure from the normal state of nature. Now, whether that aberration is morally wrong is impossible to state as fact. In the consciousness of some, homosexuality is an acceptable alternative lifestyle. But for others, it is sinful. It depends on your belief system.\n\nBut since we live in a secular country where laws and policy are not based on religious beliefs, the immoral argument should not be a basis for banning gay adoption. America is not Saudi Arabia, and the fact that only three states limit gay adoption \u2014Florida, Mississippi, and Utah \u2014 tells us that a blanket rejection of gay adoption is certainly the minority view in this country.\n\nThat being said, there is no question that a child is better off in a mainstream home with responsible heterosexual parents. Confusion is diminished, security heightened. Kids need to feel as secure as possible in order to develop fully.\n\nBut in cases where children face a continuing merry-go-round of foster care as opposed to a stable home run by gays, a caring person must choose the latter. The concern should always be for the child, not for any hatred of an alternative lifestyle.\n\nThere are obviously many good, caring people who are gay. These people should not be rejected as adoptive parents by the state of Florida or anywhere else.\n\nNow, for Miss O'Donnell, I respect her cause but strongly disagree with her methods. There is no reason for her to define her sexuality in public. She could have led her crusade without getting into what she does in her private life. Does she have a right to \u2014 quote \u2014 \"come out\"? Sure she does. Is it a smart thing to do? No.\n\nFrom now on, many people will be judging Rosie O'Donnell. Some will dislike her because she dropped her sexuality into the consciousness of children. I really don't want to explain to a 7-year-old why Rosie called herself a dyke in a comedy club, OK? I don't even want a 7-year-old to know what a dyke is. Call me a Philistine, but kids should have a childhood free of sexual nuance.\n\nThe more famous people blab about what their sexual preferences are, the worse it is for society.\n\nRosie O'Donnell and every other American should just shut up about their sex lives. It's dumb to define yourself by sex anyway. O'Donnell is an Irish American woman, OK? There's your definition. This in-your-face sex stuff is all about power and acceptance. Many gays believe their proclivities should be considered normal, but that will never happen because of the nature thing.\n\nShould gays be denied the rights that other Americans have? Definitely not. They should be allowed to adopt and live their lives without harassment. Should gays embrace discretion and privacy? You bet they should. The kids and everybody else would be better for it.\n\nAnd that's The Memo.\n\nThe Most Ridiculous Item of the Day\n\nTime now for \"Most Ridiculous Item of the Day.\"\n\nAnd it's not ridiculous but informative. Earlier this week, we did a segment on the widow of Pedro Czecko who was killed on 9/11 at the World Trade Center. Because the woman was involved in a common law situation, her compensation by the federal government is in question. But special master Kenneth Feinberg writes to us, \"Based on the information provided on The O'Reilly Factor, the couple's three children should be eligible recipients. We will review the family's individual circumstances.\n\nWell, that is good news and not ridiculous at all. We passed Mr. Feinberg's note along to the family's lawyer.\n\n\u2014 You can watch Bill O'Reilly's Talking Points and \"Most Ridiculous Item\" weeknights at 8 & 11p.m. ET on the Fox News Channel.

Meni Mazuz decided that gay adults will be allowed to adopt  the biological or adopted child of their partner and, in some  cases, even adopt children not connected to them.      Courts in the Jewish state in the past have only allowed gay  adults to adopt the child of their partner, the justice ministry  said.      'It was decided there is no legal hindrance from approving  same-sex couples, or one of the partners, to adopt an unrelated  child who is not the child of either partner,' the justice  ministry said in a statement.      The statement said the decision, made after a debate to  determine the status of same-sex couples, deals only with legal  considerations and individual cases will be decided by Israel's  child welfare services.

      "Text": "    By Ed Stoddard      ST. PAUL, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The Log Cabin Republicans  endorsed Arizona Sen. John McCain's bid for the presidency on  Tuesday, four years after the gay Republican group refused to  back President George W. Bush's bid for reelection.      The endorsement may boost McCain's reputation as a maverick  who reaches across partisan lines, but it may not go down well  with his party's conservative Christian base.      'Sen. McCain is no George Bush when it comes to gay issues.  We are much more optimistic and enthusiastic about Sen.  McCain,' Patrick Sammon, the group's president, told Reuters.      The 20,000-member group backed Bush in 2000, but did not  endorse him in 2004 when the Republican Party used opposition  to gay marriage as a 'wedge' issue to galvanize evangelical  Christian voters.      But the group appreciates McCain's opposition to a failed  attempt to enact a federal ban on gay marriage -- a position  that angered many conservative evangelical leaders.      'Sen. McCain stood with us. Now we stand with him ... Sen.  McCain showed courage by bucking his own party's leadership and  the president -- twice voting against the amendment,' the Log  Cabin Republicans said.      The group said it would take a 'wait and see approach'  regarding McCain's choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his  vice presidential running mate.      'We have a wait and see approach with Gov. Palin about her  views on gay issues,' Sammon said.      Jimmy LaSalvia, the group's director of programs and  policy, said there were encouraging signs.      'We don't know that much about her ... In her public  statements she has said that she has gay friends and that she  doesn't judge,' he said.      Palin is a conservative Christian who has excited that wing  of the Republican Party mostly because of her strong opposition  to abortion rights.      Sammon said the organization was pleased that McCain's  campaign was not inflaming passions around the issue of gay  marriage. Proposals to ban same-sex unions will be on the  ballot during the Nov. 4 election in California and Florida.      The group said there were some two dozen openly gay  delegates at the convention in St. Paul.      Being openly gay is not easy in a party with a strong base  of evangelical Christians who read the Bible as the literal  word of God and believe there are biblical sanctions against  homosexuality.      Members of the Log Cabin Republicans say they stick with  the party because of core principles such as fiscal  conservatism and support for a strong national defense. Little  polling has been done on the topic, but most gay voters favor  the Democratic Party.

      "Text": "    By Jon Hurdle      PHILADELPHIA, May 12 (Reuters Life) - Philadelphia's gay  community sought to dispel some sexual stereotypes when it held  the city's first gay rodeo.      About 50 contestants roped steers, cracked whips, and  wrestled cattle to the ground during the weekend in an attempt  to prove to themselves - and the rest of the world - that they  are just as capable of tackling a traditionally macho sport as  their straight counterparts.      'This proves that we are normal,' said Jen Vrana, president  and founder of the Liberty Gay Rodeo Association, a 240-member  group that was founded two years ago.      'This is an all-American sport, and we are all-American  people.'      But the event - like other longer-established gay rodeos  elsewhere in the United States - distinguishes itself from  mainstream rodeos by injecting a little fun along with the  strength and skill required to control a bucking animal.      Interspersed with familiar events like steer riding and  calf roping were 'goat dressing' - in which pairs of  contestants try to put hot-pink underwear on the hind quarters  of an uncooperative goat in the shortest time - and 'steer  decorating' in which one partner of a team has to tie a ribbon  on the tail of a struggling steer while the other tries to hold  on to its horns.      Chuck Curry, a 45-year-old contestant in three events, came  to the rodeo from Fort Lauderdale Florida. He said he had  already participated in five other gay rodeos over the last  three years and works two jobs, as a barman and a taxi driver,  to support his hobby.      Asked why the rodeo appeals to him so much, he replied: 'I  get to meet people - that's as politely as I can put it.'      Curry said gay rodeos, which were started in the mid-1970s,  have caught on so much that his father, who wanted him to  become a football player, comes to watch.      Scott Jackson, one of about 500 mostly male spectators,  said gay rodeos appeal to the gay community because they  reinforce a sense of masculinity among a population that has  stereotypically feminine traits. It also allows participants to  aspire to a 'country and western lifestyle' even if they are  city dwellers.      'It's a very dangerous event, and we are doing things that  the professionals do,' said Jackson, 38, a government worker  from Oklahoma City who had come to Philadelphia to support its  first gay rodeo.      Although the Philadelphia event was held in suburban Devon,  home to a blue-blood horse show, the gay crowd did its best to  create a western atmosphere, wearing cowboy hats and boots, and  tight jeans with oversize belt buckles.      Dan Williamson, 44, a graphic designer from Washington DC,  said he attends gay rodeos because they are a chance to be  among friends. 'It's not so much about being gay,' he said.  'It's like a church picnic, you know everybody, it's very  accepting.'

Following are some facts about adoption in the United  States:           * Between 130,000 and 140,000 children are adopted each  year. Half of these are adopted by step-parents as new  relationships are formed.      * Around 20,000 children are adopted from abroad each year,  the majority of whom are adopted transracially.      * Between 50,000 and 60,000 children are adopted from  foster care each year, mostly by a parent or parents of the  same race.      * Black children are under-represented among children  adopted from foster care relative to the number of children  waiting in foster care for adoption.      * White children, who make up 58 percent of children in  U.S. society, represent 38 percent of those in foster care but  45 percent of those adopted, according to fiscal year 2006  figures.      * Black children make up 15 percent of total number of  children in the United States but represent 32 percent of those  in foster care and 27 percent of the total number adopted.      * Hispanic children make up 19 percent of children in  society, 20 percent of those waiting for adoption and 19  percent of those adopted.      * The two main laws governing the placement of children in  transracial adoption are the Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994  and the Removal of Barriers to Interethnic Adoption Provisions  of 1996.

      "Text": "    By Axel Bugge      LISBON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Portugal's parliament rejected a  proposal on Friday to allow gay marriage, sparking anger among  gays who say they face discrimination in the conservative  Catholic country.      The proposal by the small Left Bloc and Green parties to  overturn an existing ban was overwhelmingly rejected as the  ruling Socialists, who hold a majority, joined the centre-right  opposition in opposing the move.      Parliament president Jaime Gaime did not give a final vote  breakdown but said the proposal had been rejected, the  legislature's television channel showed.      Outside parliament, about thirty gays protested by staging  two mock marriages.      'I am here because there are citizens who are full citizens  in their duties but not citizens in their rights and that is a  very serious mistake in a democracy,' Joana, a woman who married  her partner, told Reuters Television.      'Old homophobes!' a gay protester shouted inside the voting  chamber after the vote, before being led out by police.      Gays were encouraged that a referendum in Portugal last year  overturned a ban on abortion, hoping it would usher in what they  see as more progressive and modern values elsewhere in Europe.  Neighbouring Spain has allowed gay marriages since 2005.      But Catholic values still hold sway on many social issues in  Portugal. Cardinal Jose Policarpo, the patriarch of Lisbon,  warned that allowing gay marriages would be a violation of the  family.      'What is in question is breaking the profound conception of  the family,' he said on Radio Renascenca, a Catholic radio  station.      Alice Ferreira, a 70-year-old pensioner, told SIC television  that gays could have their own sexual preferences but they  should not be allowed to marry.      'I don't think they could be real marriages because  marriages are intended to create families,' she said.      Supporters of the change argue that the ban on gay marriage  included in Portugal's civil code is illegal under the 1975  constitution, which bans sexual discrimination.      Polls have shown under 30 percent of Portuguese approve of  gay marriage against an average around 45 percent in the  European Union, according to Eurobarometer.

      "Text": "    By Mabvuto Banda      LILONGWE, April 3 (Reuters) - Malawi's government has  recommended that its High Court approve American pop star  Madonna's adoption of David Banda, the child she met in a  Malawian orphanage a year and a half ago.      Madonna began adoption proceedings in 2006 and the  2-year-old has been living with the pop star and her film  director husband Guy Ritchie in their London home since then.      The adoption has been controversial, with critics accusing  the government of skirting laws that ban non-residents from  adopting children in Malawi, which has been badly hit by an AIDS  epidemic leaving more than one million orphans.      But in a confidential report dated March 25, 2008, signed by  Probation Officer S. Chisale at the Ministry of Women and Child  Development, the government said Madonna and Ritchie had proved  to be suitable parents for the Malawian boy.      'In the best interest of the child, I do recommend the  petitioners to your Lordship for your consideration that they be  granted an adoption order having proved that they are suitable  parents and satisfied the conditions in the Interim Adoption  Order,' the report.      In February, Malawian Information Minister Patricia Kaliati  praised Madonna's efforts to rally support for orphans in the  impoverished country and said it would be wrong for the  government to deny the pop star's adoption of a child there.      Meanwhile, Madonna's lawyers have asked the courts to delay  the singer's appearance in court for the adoption hearing from  next week to the end of April, because she has another  engagement in the United States.      'They have made that application at (the) High Court today  and the judge is expected to respond this afternoon,' a court  official said.

      "Text": "    By Alex Dobuzinskis      LOS ANGELES, June 5 (Reuters) - Hollywood's 'glass closet'  may not be shattered, but with stars such as Ellen DeGeneres  and T.R. Knight openly out and shows like 'The L Word' proving  popular in recent years, insiders say being gay or lesbian is  no longer a career breaker for celebrities.      The California Supreme Court on Wednesday gave a final  approval for gay marriages in the state, clearing the way for  talk show host DeGeneres and her girlfriend of four years,  actress Portia de Rossi, to marry as planned.      Last week actress Lindsay Lohan, 21, was the subject of  widespread talk in celebrity magazines that she was having a  lesbian affair with friend Samantha Ronson, prompting some in  Hollywood to encourage her to go public with the relationship.      If she did, it might not hurt her career, as it most  definitely would have only a few years ago. In fact, say many  gay Hollywood players, it has not hurt theirs.      'After publicly coming out, I haven't noticed a  difference,' 'Grey's Anatomy' star T.R. Knight told Reuters at  an event to celebrate gay marriage in West Hollywood.      But Knight, who was forced by a colleague to disclose  publicly he was gay, noted he had a steady job, which cannot be  said for others.      Actor Rock Hudson kept his homosexuality a secret for  decades for fear it would hurt his ability to win leading-man  roles. His death to AIDS-related illness in 1985 shocked  Americans, and when DeGeneres publicly came out in the late  1990s it caused a media sensation.      But by early this decade, TV show 'Will & Grace,' about the  lives of a gay man and straight woman, had become a critical    and audience hit, a sign of increasing public acceptance.           CRACKS IN 'GLASS CLOSET'      Still, experts say a 'glass closet' exists for some actors,  but because many openly gay celebrities such as Knight,  DeGeneres, De Rossi and Rosie O'Donnell are breaking barriers  that have stood for years, that closet is cracking.      Ilene Chaiken, creator and executive producer of 'The L  Word,' the popular lesbian-themed show on the cable channel  Showtime, said Hollywood's attitude toward gay content has  improved and that soon any gay 'stigma' will be irrelevant.      'Our kids think it's absurd gay people can't get married,  and by the time they are the dominant consumer culture, most of  these issues are going to be non-issues,' she said.      But some actors, especially men, still fear coming out.      Film and TV fans are more likely to warm to a lesbian  actress than a gay actor, the experts said. Women are less  likely to feel threatened by a lesbian woman. Some men see them  as sexy, and gay men as challenging their own sexuality.       Howard Bragman, a veteran Hollywood publicist who is  openly gay, noted that Hollywood still has no shining example  of a megastar leading man who came out of the closet and  thrived in his career.      Still, in recent years, a few gay actors such as Knight and  Neil Patrick Harris, who plays a womanizing man about town on  TV's 'How I Met Your Mother,' have remained high-profile stars  since breaking out of the glass closet.      Compare that to actor Leslie Jordan, 53, of the former NBC  program 'Will & Grace' and author of the recently released book  'My Trip Down the Pink Carpet,' who faced steep adversity when  he stepped off the bus in Hollywood more than 25 years ago.      Jordan has always been openly gay, but early in his ca",

      "Text": "    LILONGWE, May 15 (Reuters) - Malawi's High Court has delayed  its final ruling on whether U.S. pop diva Madonna may adopt a  two-year-old Malawian boy until next week, her lawyer said on  Thursday.      'We are finished with the proceedings today from our side,  and the judge has decided to reserve his ruling on the case  until next week because he has to review the recommendations  from the Malawi Human Rights Commission on the adoption laws of  Malawi,' Alan Chinula said.      The Human Rights Commission is set up by the government. Its  position on the adoption of toddler David Banda has not been  made public. An exact date for next week's ruling was not  announced.      The adoption has been controversial, with critics accusing  the government of skirting laws that ban non-residents from  adopting children in Malawi, which has been ravaged by an AIDS  epidemic leaving more than one million orphans.      But Malawi's government and David's father -- his only  surviving parent -- had endorsed the adoption, and a local  rights group that had opposed the case said earlier this week it  was no longer interested in pursuing the case, removing another  obstacle.      Madonna could not attend the court session on Thursday  because she was too busy with other engagements, her lawyer said  earlier this week.      Madonna began adoption proceedings for David in 2006 and the  boy has been living with her and her film director husband Guy  Ritchie in their London home since then. She took David when he  was 13 months old after his father had placed him in an  orphanage following the death of his wife.

Nepal put on hold adoption of its children last year after  news of widespread corruption and criticism that some children  were being sold off, leaving hundreds of families in confusion.      Prakash Kumar Adhikari, a senior official in the Ministry of  Women, Children and Social Welfare said foreign agencies could  work as 'intermediaries' between potential adopting families in  their respective countries and the Nepali authorities.      He said the government would accept requests through firms  from Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Italy, Spain,  Norway, the United States and Canada for adoption of Nepali  children.      'These countries have a good social security system,  including education and health care,' he said.      'We'll soon start accepting applications from prospective  families for adoption through the accredited agencies.'      The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and a Swiss child  relief agency, Terre des hommes (Tdh), said in a report in August  that the sale, abduction and trafficking of children was common  and Nepal should press for adoption by local families.

      "Text": "    By Sandor Peto and Krisztina Than      BUDAPEST, July 5 (Reuters) - Hungarian riot police used  water cannon and tear gas on Saturday to stop far-right  extremists from throwing petrol bombs and breaking up the annual  gay parade in the capital Budapest.      Hundreds of far-right demonstrators threw petrol bombs and  stones at the police as the police tried to separate them from  the participants of the 'Gay Pride' march. They also threw eggs  and firecrackers at people in the parade.      Riot police detained 45 people, police spokeswoman Eva  Tafferner said.      Ambulance workers and police said at least eight people were  wounded in the clashes, including two policemen.      The anti-gay demonstrators attacked a police car carrying  Socialist European Parliament member and human rights activist  Katalin Levai. They slammed a stone through the window of the  police car but she was not hurt.      'This is outrageous and shameful that some 20 years after  the change of regime, this is what we have ... such  intolerance,' Levai told Reuters.      'This (violence) is sad,' said 32-year-old book editor  Istvan Ruzsacz, who took part in the parade.      'Those people simply don't accept that gays exist and use  this as an opportunity to advertise themselves.'      A leading liberal politician Gabor Horn was also attacked  according to local news agency Index.      Although homosexuality was legalised in eastern Europe after  the collapse of communism, same-sex couples rarely display   their affection publicly and gay parades have sparked scorn and  violence in several other countries in the region.      A week ago, about 60 far-right extremists were arrested in  Bulgaria's capital, Sofia, after they tried to break up the  country's first gay parade.      Participants in a parade in the Czech city of Brno were also  attacked by anti-gay activists last week.      Hungary passed a law last year which will legalise  registered partnerships of same-sex couples from 2009. Hungarian  gay groups have argued they should be allowed to adopt children.      Last year, when participants of the gay parade were pelted  with eggs in Budapest, rights group Amnesty International  criticised Hungary for what it said was a failure of police to  protect the peaceful march.

      "Text": "    By Adam Tanner      SAN FRANCISCO, March 4 (Reuters) - Four years after San  Francisco ignited passionate embraces and heated national  debate by briefly allowing gay marriage, California's top court  hears arguments on Tuesday as to whether matrimony should be  limited to a man and a woman.      The hearing brings into focus the highest-profile U.S.  fight over gay rights in recent years and the outcome could end  up influencing legislation and litigation in other states.      San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom forced the issue by suddenly  issuing gay marriage licenses in February 2004. More than 4,000  homosexual couples took him up on the offer, including comedian  Rosie O'Donnell and her partner, until a lower court halted the  process.      Later that year California's Supreme Court ruled that  Newsom, mayor of a city long at the forefront of gay rights,  had no authority to wed gays and voided the marriages.      The same court just across the street from City Hall where  the gay marriages took place now decides the larger question  whether California can legally bar same-sex matrimony.      Gay marriage supporters won an initial battle when a  Superior Court judge ruled in their favor in 2005. The  following year a state appeals court judge overruled that  decision and backed existing state law.      Californians in 2000 approved a ballot measure defining  marriage as the union of man and woman. But domestic  partnership legislation as of 2005 gave registered gay couples  many of the same privileges enjoyed by married couples.      Since 2005 California's legislature twice voted to allow gay  marriages, but Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who is  liberal on many social issues, vetoed the bills, saying voters or  the courts should decide the issue.           UNUSUAL SESSION      It now falls to the seven justices of the California  Supreme Court to resolve the matter, and they have 90 days from  the hearing to issue an opinion. With six of the judges  appointed by Republican governors and one appointed by a  Democrat, the panel is considered politically moderate.      The court has made a rare exception to its one-hour total  limit on oral arguments and will hold a three-hour session.      'I can't recall any where there were three hours of  arguments, I really can't,' Cruz Reynoso told Reuters about his  years as a California Supreme Court justice from 1982-87.      'Not often, but sometimes, oral arguments actually make a  difference in difficult cases and I assume that the court  considers this a difficult case.'      More than half of U.S. states have passed constitutional  amendments barring gay marriage, and President George W. Bush has  proposed a U.S. Constitutional amendment.      State supreme courts in Massachusetts, New Jersey and  Vermont have ruled against limiting marriage to a man and a  woman. Massachusetts responded by becoming the only U.S. state  to allow gay marriage, while New Jersey and Vermont instead  passed civil union laws similar to those in California.      Several other state supreme courts, including those in New  York, Washington and Maryland, found that marriage can be  limited to one man, one woman.

      "Text": "    STOCKHOLM, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Three of the four parties in  Sweden's centre-right coalition government unveiled a bill on  Wednesday paving the way for legalising gay marriage.      Six out of the seven parties in Sweden's parliament have now  said they are in favour of gay marriage, which has raised the  likelihood of new legislation dramatically.      But the fourth member of the coalition, the Christian  Democrats, refused to back the bill which will now need the  support of at least one of the centre-left opposition parties.      The three opposition parties said they were ready to work  together with the centre-right parties, with the aim of having  the new legislation in place as soon as possible.      'We are very pleased to finally be able make these changes,'  Moderate party MP Lars Lindblad told a news conference.      'There is a firm basis for a broad agreement between six  parties,' he added, referring to a possible deal including all  parties in the Swedish Riksdag except the Christian Democrats.      The change in the law, which currently allows gay couples to  register unions but not formal marriage, would come into force  by May 1 this year under the timetable set out in the bill.      The proposed new legislation would eliminate legal  distinctions between heterosexual and homosexual spouses, but it  would not force dissenting clergy to wed gay couples.      The Swedish Lutheran church, which split from the state in  2000, has said it was open to celebrating and registering  same-sex unions, though it wanted to reserve the term matrimony  for heterosexual marriages.      The church already performs blessing ceremonies for gay  couples who have registered unions with civil authorities after  a church council decision in 2005 which outraged conservatives.

      "Text": "    ISTANBUL, May 29 (Reuters) - A Turkish court closed  Istanbul's only gay rights association on Thursday after the  prosecutor said it broke public morality laws.      The prosecutor argued the association's aims broke the law  for the protection of family and public morality, and a court  ruled in favour of closing the association.      LambdaIstanbul, set up in 1993, will be the first gay rights  association to be closed in the European Union candidate nation.      Homosexuality is legal in Turkey and central Istanbul has a  thriving gay night scene, but there are no laws to protect gay  men and lesbians from discrimination.      State-run Anatolian news agency said the judge made the  ruling at a court in Istanbul's central Beyoglu district.      'We are in a country where a closure case has been opened  against the ruling party. The political atmosphere is  anti-democratic and it lacks tolerance,' Bawer Cakir, a gay  rights activist in LambdaIstanbul, told Reuters.      Turkey's ruling AK Party faces possible closure in a  Constitutional Court case, and 71 members including Prime  Minister Tayyip Erdogan could be banned, because of alleged  anti-secular activities.      The association will appeal against the court decision at  the Court of Appeals and, if necessary, will go to the European  Court of Human Rights, Cakir said.

      "Text": "    BLANTYRE, April 19 (Reuters) - U.S. pop star Madonna has  asked a Malawian court to delay a hearing to finalise her  adoption of a boy from the southern African nation, a lawyer  close to the case said.      The singer's law firm in Malawi filed an application  requesting the High Court in Lilongwe to hear her adoption of  David Banda on May 15 instead of April 22, as originally  scheduled, the lawyer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.      Madonna's need to travel to the United States for business  reasons was cited as the reason for the delay, the lawyer said.      Court officials refused to confirm the application.      'Adoption is a confidential matter and we separate adoption  files from the regular case files,' Thomson Ligowe, assistant  registrar in the High Court, told Reuters.      Malawi's government recommended earlier this month that the  court approve the adoption of Banda.      The pop diva met the boy in an orphanage in 2006 and began  adoption proceedings soon after. He has been living with Madonna  and her film director husband Guy Ritchie in London since  shortly after the adoption process began.      The adoption has been controversial, with critics accusing  the government of skirting laws that ban non-residents from  adopting children in Malawi, one of the countries in Africa  hardest hit by AIDS.      The epidemic has left an estimated one million orphans in  the country.

      "Text": "    By Edith Honan      NEW YORK, Nov 26  (Reuters) - New York is close to becoming  the first U.S. state to pass legislation making gay marriage  legal but, like many political issues in the state capital  Albany, it has fallen victim to a power struggle.      Democrats won a majority in the upper house Senate for the  first time in more than 40 years in the Nov. 4 election, but  three Democratic senators refuse to back fellow Democratic Sen.  Malcolm Smith as majority leader without concessions.      The Republicans could regain their power in the Senate if  the three Democratic senators, who include longtime gay  marriage opponent Sen. Ruben Diaz, opt to vote with them.      'I will not give my vote to a leader that will bring gay  marriage to the state,' Diaz, a Pentecostal minister, said in  an interview. 'Have a voter referendum. Let the people  decide.'      Connecticut and Massachusetts are the only U.S. states that  allow same-sex marriage as a result of court rulings. No state  legislature has instituted gay marriage into law.      After Californian voters passed Prop 8 on Nov. 4 reversing  the state's Supreme Court decision in May to allow same-sex  marriage, the next battleground state for gay mariage is  expected to be New York. The New York Assembly passed a  marriage bill in June 2007 but the Senate has yet to act.      The Senate power struggle has delayed appointment of a  majority leader until January and upset gay rights activists  who believed gay marriage would be legalized once Democrats  took control of the Senate.      Albany has a reputation for bickering and power struggles,  which critics say was demonstrated when the legislature last  week rejected Democratic Gov. David Paterson's emergency budget  cuts for many reasons, including the Senate leadership battle.      Gay marriage has broad support in the Democratic-controlled  lower house, the State Assembly, where it passed in a vote of  85 to 61 last year. It was never put to a vote in the upper  house when the Republicans controlled the Senate.      Paterson, who in May ordered all state agencies to  recognize out-of-state gay marriages, has said he would sign  such a bill into law.      'It's going to happen. It's not an if, it's a when,' said  Sen. Tom Duane, a same-sex marriage campaigner.      Gay rights groups say they are still hopeful New York and  New Jersey legislatures will pass gay marriage bills as soon as  2009 and are unfazed by the New York State Senate leadership  struggle.      'When the dust settles, and we do consider it dust, there  will be a Democratic majority leader who will put forth a  marriage equality bill,' said Marty Rouse, national field  director for Human Rights Campaign, a major U.S. gay rights  group.      Alan Van Capelle, executive director of Empire State Pride  Agenda, said the gay marriage issue had not proven to be toxic  as none of the Republican assembly members who voted for  same-sex marriage in 2007 were voted out of office.      But Duane Motley, executive director of the Christian lobby  group New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms, said that even  if Smith is named majority leader, passage of gay marriage is  by no means assured.      'It's not a done deal,' he said. 'The rank and file people  of New York State are not in favor of homosexual marriages.'      Smith has not said publicly how he will handle the gay  marriage issue if he is made majority leader at the next  legislative session in January.      'Re",

      "Text": "    BUCHAREST, May 24 (Reuters) - Around 200 gay activists  marched through Bucharest on Saturday in a heavily policed pride  parade that defied efforts by religious and far-right groups to  have the annual event banned.      Earlier this week, anti-gay groups tried to get a court to  rule against the march, Romania's fifth annual gay festival.      Two counter-demonstrations were held ahead of the parade. At  one, members of a far-right group chanted 'Romania does not want  you' in a protest they said was 'against sin'.      Romania decriminalised homosexuality in 2001, but gay people  often face hostility in this largely conservative country of 22  million where the powerful Orthodox church views homosexuality  as a sin and a disease.      Police said the gay rights march passed off without  incident.      'It is encouraging,' riot police spokesman Marius Militaru  told reporters. 'People are becoming aware that we are heading  towards a degree of normality.'      Last year riot police detained dozens of protesters who  tried to break up a gay rights march.       About 1,200 police were deployed to protect the parade this  year.      'I want to thank the police here today ... but we should be  able to march and be ourselves without the police marching  along,' Michael Cashman, a British member of the European  Parliament, told activists.

      "Text": "    HANOI, April 28 (Reuters) - U.S. investigators said they had  found evidence of baby trafficking and corruption in Vietnam's  adoption system, prompting Hanoi to end adoptions to the United  States, officials said on Monday.      Communist-run Vietnam's adoption system has had a turbulent  history and it came under the spotlight a year ago when actress  Angelina Jolie visited the Southeast Asian country to adopt a  boy.      A U.S. embassy spokeswoman said the Vietnamese government  sent a letter to the Hanoi embassy saying it would stop taking  adoption applications after July 1.      Official figures show that Americans adopted 828 Vietnamese  children in 2007.      U.S. investigators said it received credible reports from  current and former employees of Adoption Service Providers  working in Vietnam regarding corruption in the adoption system,  beginning with the licensing procedures.      'The survey reflects findings from investigation of hundreds  of cases,' said U.S. embassy spokeswoman Angela Aggeler.      Vietnamese officials denied the corruption and bribery  allegations in the report.      Investigators said several providers reported they were told  they had to fund tours to the United States for government  officials in order to receive their licenses and that the tours  included shopping sprees, where the agencies were expected to  pay for all of the purchases of the Vietnamese delegation.      Others said they had to pay bribes for provincial licences.      Agencies also reported that cash and in-kind donations were  diverted by orphanage officials and used to finance personal  property, private cars, jewellery and, in one case, a commercial  real estate development, the report said.      Aggeler said the government would process cases of families  matched with babies before July 1 until an adoption agreement  between Hanoi and Washington expires on Sept. 1.      The United States resumed adoptions from Vietnam in 2006  after the two governments signed a new agreement following the  suspension of an earlier pact in 2003 over suspicions of  corruption.

      "Text": "    By Peter Henderson      SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Same-sex marriage  advocates plan to 'Call in gay' on Wednesday in a protest  designed to show Americans how big a part of daily life -- and  the economy -- gays and their supporters are.      The Internet-organized project, which follows California's  passage of anti-same-sex-marriage Proposition 8, urges 'Day  Without a Gay' participants to skip work and volunteer in the  community.      The idea is creating a controversy over how to garner  support without protesters hurting their cause.      Californians struck down same-sex marriage last month,  reversing a court decision that had affirmed the right. The  Nov. 4 vote stopped gay unions in California -- one of a  handful of states, provinces and mostly European countries that  allowed it.      After the vote, protest marches targeted U.S. temples of  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Mormons,  who were top supporters of California Proposition 8, which  limits marriage to a man and a woman. That led to a nationwide  protest day on Nov. 15.      'In order for this movement to continue it can't just be  about marching and being pissed off. It's got to be creative in  different ways to get into the hearts and minds of moderate  voters,' said daywithoutagay.org creator Sean Hetherington.      The Los Angeles comedian and his boyfriend, Aaron Hartzler,  put the focus on volunteering, although one of the groups  behind the Nov. 15 rallies, jointheimpact.com, urges people to  shut businesses and avoid spending anything.      The protest appears inspired by the 2004 film 'A Day  Without a Mexican' which imagines the effect on California of a  day when there are no Latinos, leading to chaos on the state.

      "Text": "    SINGAPORE, April 25 (Reuters) - Singapore's state-owned  television was fined S$15,000 ($11,040) by the country's censor  for promoting gay lifestyle by airing a programme that showed a  gay couple and their adopted baby, a newspaper said on Friday.      The Straits Times reported that Singapore's Media Development  Authority said the episode of home and decor series Find and  Design, in which the host helped the couple decorate a nursery,  'normalises and promotes a gay lifestyle'.      The pro-government newspaper said the censor had also  objected to scenes of the couple and their baby as well as the  host's acknowledgement of them as a family, because it broke a  rule 'which disallows programmes that promote, justify or  glamorise gay lifestyles'.      Under Singapore law, homosexuality is illegal and a man who  is found to have committed an act of 'gross indecency' with  another man can be jailed for up to two years, though  prosecutions are rare.      Authorities have banned gay festivals and censored gay films  in the past, saying homosexuality should not be advocated as a  lifestyle. But, despite the official ban, Singapore has a  thriving gay scene.

      "Text": "    By Ed Stoddard      DALLAS, June 19 (Reuters) - This week's start of gay  marriages in California has pushed a hot-button social issue  into the U.S. presidential campaign, but will it be a sideshow  or a main event?      When voters in California and Florida choose between  presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama and Republican John  McCain in November, they will also be asked to weigh amendments  to the state constitutions seeking to ban same-sex marriage.      Such ballot initiatives played a key role in President  George W. Bush's 2004 re-election as they galvanized the  Republican Party's conservative Christian base.      But several key things are very different this year.      The first is McCain. In sharp contrast to Bush, the Arizona  senator is regarded with suspicion by many conservative  evangelicals because of his past lack of support for a federal  ban on same-sex marriage and other 'liberal' offenses.      'McCain is a Republican nominee who has to appeal to the  base but he is much queasier on social issues with the  exception of abortion. He is much less confrontational on  things like gay marriage,' said Cal Jillson, a political  scientist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.      The evangelical movement, which counts one in four U.S.  adults among its ranks, has also undergone change since 2004 as  it broadens its biblical agenda beyond abortion and gay  marriage to embrace issues like global warming that were  previously seen as causes of the left.           BACK ON THE RADAR      Neither Obama nor McCain have made gay marriage a  centerpiece of their campaigns. Obama, an Illinois senator, has  said states should make their own decisions on marriage but  believes 'same-sex couples should enjoy equal rights under the  law.'      The California Supreme Court has put the issue on the 2008  electoral agenda just when it seemed to have faded far behind  concerns about a recession, the housing crisis, soaring fuel  prices and the war in Iraq.      Same-sex weddings kicked off in California on Monday after  a ruling by the court paved the way for their recognition. And  unlike Massachusetts, the only other state where gay marriage  is legal, California will wed couples from other states.      With or without a staunch religious conservative in the  White House race, this has the 'Religious Right' seeing red.      The Southern Baptist Convention, America's largest  evangelical denomination, last week called on its 400,000  members in California to support the amendment against gay  marriage in November.      But California is viewed as safely Democratic and not seen  tilting Republican because of the issue, although voters could  reject gay marriage in the ballot initiative.      The same cannot be said of Florida, which has a large  evangelical community and where the presidential contest is  shaping up to be tight.      According to the latest Quinnipiac University Swing State  poll released on Wednesday, Obama's lead over McCain in Florida  is 47 percent to 43 percent -- hardly a wide margin.      'Florida is close enough ... that energized social  conservatives could affect the outcome there,' said Jillson.      Social conservatives are gearing up in Florida, where the  amendment needs 60 percent support by voters to pass.      The issue could also heat up elsewhere if a couple from  Kansas or some other heartland state gets married in California  and then demands that local authorities recognize their un",

      "Text": "    By Alex Dobuzinskis      LOS ANGELES, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Battling to save the right  to same-sex marriage in what is expected to be a close state  vote next month, California gay rights backers are turning to  Hollywood celebrities for help at a major fundraiser.      Actress and singer Barbra Streisand is expected at the  event on Tuesday and singers Melissa Etheridge and Mary J.  Blige will perform, organizers said on Thursday.      Supermarket billionaire Ron Burkle will host the event at  his Beverly Hills home, with a private $25,000-a-plate dinner.  Among other entertainment figures planning to attend are  actor/director Rob Reiner.      In recent weeks, director Steven Spielberg and actor Brad  Pitt each donated $100,000 in support of the campaign to  preserve the right to gay marriage.      The fundraiser comes as backers of same-sex marriage fight  to stem a tide of support for Proposition 8, a Nov. 4 ballot  measure that seeks to define marriage under the California  Constitution as only between a man and a woman.      A poll released last week by Survey USA showed 47 percent  of Californians supported the measure, while 42 percent opposed  it.      'We're feeling very good about the surge in the campaign,'  said Sonja Eddings Brown, a spokeswoman for Protect Marriage,  the group advocating for a 'Yes' vote on Proposition 8.      The 'Yes' campaign has raised $25.4 million, compared with  $15.8 million for those who wish to maintain the right to gay  marriage.      In recent weeks, advocates of same-sex marriage have chided  the Hollywood community for failing to contribute cash to the  campaign to defeat Proposition 8.      But Geoff Kors, executive director of Equality California,  said the fundraiser would show Hollywood's support for   same-sex marriage rights.      'Having support from Hollywood leaders who are visible, who  reach a wide audience, is critical to our success,' Kors said.      'It's always really scary when you're being outspent 2 to   1 in an election, and when your rights are at stake and  someone's trying to take your rights away,' he added.      In recent days, opponents of same-sex marriage have stepped  up their television advertising and warned voters that if  Proposition 8 is defeated, children will be taught about gay  marriage in elementary schools.      Gay-marriage supporters call that argument misleading.      In California, an estimated 11,000 same-sex couples have  married since the state's highest court in May overturned a  state ban on same-sex marriage.      Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres and actress Portia de Rossi  wed in August in one the most high-profile same-sex unions.  Etheridge has said she plans to marry girlfriend Tammy Lynn  Michaels before Nov. 4.      DeGeneres released an online video message this week urging  California voters to strike down Proposition 8.      Gay and lesbian marriage was legalized last week in  Connecticut, bringing to three the number of U.S. states that  allow it.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nWatch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET and listen to the \"Radio Factor!\"\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM, GUEST HOST: In the \"Personal Story\" segment tonight: According to a report in the L.A. Times, some gay rights supporters in Hollywood may be starting a blacklist against people who supported traditional marriage by giving money to Prop 8 advocates.\n\nJoining us now from Los Angeles is Andrew Breitbart, publisher of Breitbart.com, and one of a handful of conservatives who are brave enough to speak out in Hollywood. Andrew, great to see you.\n\nClick here to watch the segment.\n\nANDREW BREITBART, BREITBART.COM: Hey, Laura. How are you?\n\nINGRAHAM: I remember when George Clooney was telling us that, you know, the biggest threat to mankind, you know, a few decades back was the blacklisting in Hollywood of people who dared to question authority. And so is this actually happening now on the other side of the political fence?\n\nBREITBART: Well, this is a more conspicuous form of blacklisting. It happens for conservatives every single day in Hollywood. This FEC search mechanism is a way that the left, the activist left, not specifically gay groups, because there are a lot of gay people who are against gay marriage. There are a lot of people who think that it should be up for debate.\n\nBut this is the same group of people back in the 1980s, Michelangelo Signorile, who started OutWeek magazine, who started to out people who were actually gay who didn't agree with the activist left agenda for the gay community. So what's happening right now is those schoolyard bullies are back, playing a bigger game on a bigger playground.\n\nINGRAHAM: Right.\n\nBREITBART: Yes.\n\nINGRAHAM: What are they actually doing? What's being done to people who have given to Prop 8? Because I know the San Francisco Chronicle is allowing people who go to their Web site to find out who gave to what Prop 8 groups.\n\nBREITBART: It's there. That's exactly what they are doing. Scott Eckern, who is the musical \u2014 the director of the California Musical Theater, had his name initially exposed, and he had to step down. To me that's an effective blacklist.\n\nEl Coyote restaurant in Los Angeles, the floor manager, not the owner but the floor manager, gave $100. And people started to protest El Coyote restaurant. So it's not just about blacklisting. It's blacklisting entire institutions if somebody is associated with it.\n\nMy father-in-law, who was blacklisted in the 1950s for being a communist, is a Christian now, believes in the sanctity of marriage, of the definition between a man and a woman, and they are protesting his theater in Venice, California.\n\nINGRAHAM: So right now there clearly is no real free speech in Hollywood. There's no political free speech. If major Hollywood executives don't speak out against this intimidation, they have no credibility. I don't want to see another movie about the blacklist of the 1940s and '50s. I don't want to see it again coming out of Hollywood. They have no credibility with me. None.\n\nBREITBART: Well, what's so important about this issue right now is that George Clooney is silent, and secondly, President-elect Barack Obama is against gay marriage. Joe Biden, Vice President-elect Joe Biden is against gay marriage. So were Bill and Hillary Clinton when they implemented don't ask, don't tell and the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\nWhat they have done specifically is isolate conservative groups, the Mormon Church, which is safe. I asked Michelangelo Signorile to go down to a local mosque with a group of angry activist left people and to protest the Islamic position on gay marriage. He won't do that.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nBREITBART: And he won't go after President-elect Barack Obama. President-elect Barack Obama has an aggressive attitude towards gay rights in this country, and they allow for him to get away with it.\n\nINGRAHAM: Well, Andrew, that is such a great point about the mosque. I mean, that would show true courage, OK? Go after the black churches and the mosques, and we'll see whether they're actually going to put their money where their mouths are.\n\nAndrew, thanks a lot.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2008 FOX News Network, LLC.

      "Text": "    By Edith Honan      NEW YORK, Nov 26  (Reuters) - New York is close to becoming  the first U.S. state to pass legislation making gay marriage  legal but, like many political issues in the state capital  Albany, it has fallen victim to a power struggle.      Democrats won a majority in the upper house Senate for the  first time in more than 40 years in the Nov. 4 election, but  three Democratic senators refuse to back fellow Democratic Sen.  Malcolm Smith as majority leader without concessions.      The Republicans could regain their power in the Senate if  the three Democratic senators, who include longtime gay  marriage opponent Sen. Ruben Diaz, opt to vote with them.      'I will not give my vote to a leader that will bring gay  marriage to the state,' Diaz, a Pentecostal minister, said in  an interview. 'Have a voter referendum. Let the people  decide.'      Connecticut and Massachusetts are the only U.S. states that  allow same-sex marriage as a result of court rulings. No state  legislature has instituted gay marriage into law.      After Californian voters passed Prop 8 on Nov. 4 reversing  the state's Supreme Court decision in May to allow same-sex  marriage, the next battleground state for gay mariage is  expected to be New York. The New York Assembly passed a  marriage bill in June 2007 but the Senate has yet to act.      The Senate power struggle has delayed appointment of a  majority leader until January and upset gay rights activists  who believed gay marriage would be legalized once Democrats  took control of the Senate.      Albany has a reputation for bickering and power struggles,  which critics say was demonstrated when the legislature last  week rejected Democratic Gov. David Paterson's emergency budget  cuts for many reasons, including the Senate leadership battle.      Gay marriage has broad support in the Democratic-controlled  lower house, the State Assembly, where it passed in a vote of  85 to 61 last year. It was never put to a vote in the upper  house when the Republicans controlled the Senate.      Paterson, who in May ordered all state agencies to  recognize out-of-state gay marriages, has said he would sign  such a bill into law.      'It's going to happen. It's not an if, it's a when,' said  Sen. Tom Duane, a same-sex marriage campaigner.      Gay rights groups say they are still hopeful New York and  New Jersey legislatures will pass gay marriage bills as soon as  2009 and are unfazed by the New York State Senate leadership  struggle.      'When the dust settles, and we do consider it dust, there  will be a Democratic majority leader who will put forth a  marriage equality bill,' said Marty Rouse, national field  director for Human Rights Campaign, a major U.S. gay rights  group.      Alan Van Capelle, executive director of Empire State Pride  Agenda, said the gay marriage issue had not proven to be toxic  as none of the Republican assembly members who voted for  same-sex marriage in 2007 were voted out of office.      But Duane Motley, executive director of the Christian lobby  group New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms, said that even  if Smith is named majority leader, passage of gay marriage is  by no means assured.      'It's not a done deal,' he said. 'The rank and file people  of New York State are not in favor of homosexual marriages.'      Smith has not said publicly how he will handle the gay  marriage issue if he is made majority leader at the next  legislative session in January.      'Re",

      "Text": "    By Adam Tanner      SAN FRANCISCO, March 4 (Reuters) - Four years after San  Francisco ignited passionate embraces and heated national  debate by briefly allowing gay marriage, California's top court  hears arguments on Tuesday as to whether matrimony should be  limited to a man and a woman.      The hearing brings into focus the highest-profile U.S.  fight over gay rights in recent years and the outcome could end  up influencing legislation and litigation in other states.      San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom forced the issue by suddenly  issuing gay marriage licenses in February 2004. More than 4,000  homosexual couples took him up on the offer, including comedian  Rosie O'Donnell and her partner, until a lower court halted the  process.      Later that year California's Supreme Court ruled that  Newsom, mayor of a city long at the forefront of gay rights,  had no authority to wed gays and voided the marriages.      The same court just across the street from City Hall where  the gay marriages took place now decides the larger question  whether California can legally bar same-sex matrimony.      Gay marriage supporters won an initial battle when a  Superior Court judge ruled in their favor in 2005. The  following year a state appeals court judge overruled that  decision and backed existing state law.      Californians in 2000 approved a ballot measure defining  marriage as the union of man and woman. But domestic  partnership legislation as of 2005 gave registered gay couples  many of the same privileges enjoyed by married couples.      Since 2005 California's legislature twice voted to allow gay  marriages, but Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who is  liberal on many social issues, vetoed the bills, saying voters or  the courts should decide the issue.           UNUSUAL SESSION      It now falls to the seven justices of the California  Supreme Court to resolve the matter, and they have 90 days from  the hearing to issue an opinion. With six of the judges  appointed by Republican governors and one appointed by a  Democrat, the panel is considered politically moderate.      The court has made a rare exception to its one-hour total  limit on oral arguments and will hold a three-hour session.      'I can't recall any where there were three hours of  arguments, I really can't,' Cruz Reynoso told Reuters about his  years as a California Supreme Court justice from 1982-87.      'Not often, but sometimes, oral arguments actually make a  difference in difficult cases and I assume that the court  considers this a difficult case.'      More than half of U.S. states have passed constitutional  amendments barring gay marriage, and President George W. Bush has  proposed a U.S. Constitutional amendment.      State supreme courts in Massachusetts, New Jersey and  Vermont have ruled against limiting marriage to a man and a  woman. Massachusetts responded by becoming the only U.S. state  to allow gay marriage, while New Jersey and Vermont instead  passed civil union laws similar to those in California.      Several other state supreme courts, including those in New  York, Washington and Maryland, found that marriage can be  limited to one man, one woman.

      "Text": "    By Peter Henderson      LOS ANGELES, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Gay couples are not hiding  any more and that has made all the difference, said health care  administrator Linda Merkens before Tuesday's vote in California  that will decide the legality of same-sex marriage there.      It's one of several important ballot measures voters will  face in states across the country on Election Day.      'A lot more gays are more open about their relationships,  and a lot more people are willing to accept it,' Merkens said  in downtown Los Angeles recently.      Other passersby disagreed. 'Same sex marriage is a sin,'  said city planner Kim Chan.      Tuesday's results will show how far attitudes to gay  marriage have changed. Florida and Arizona will join California  in voting on whether to stop gay marriage.      In the past, such propositions have almost always been  approved, but polls show a close finish in California and many  undecided in all three states.      Legal abortion also faces a key challenge as South Dakotans  consider a measure to severely restrict the procedure. If it  passes, opponents are expected to challenge it all the way to  the U.S. Supreme Court. A poll by the state Argus Leader  newspaper showed that vote a toss-up.      Altogether, 150 measures in about 35 states will be put to  the vote on the same day the next U.S. president is chosen,  with other issues ranging from affirmative action to how farm  animals are treated. [ID:nN01396494].      A California court in May rejected limiting marriage to a  man and a woman. Only a few nations and states agree.      Now Hollywood stars like Brad Pitt are facing off with  conservative foes like the fast-growing Mormon church, the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, over Proposition  8, which would ban same-sex marriage.      Both sides have broad, deep pockets: ban proponents have  raised about $30 million, and opponents recently topped that.           MORE IMPORTANT THAN PRESIDENCY      'This is the most important thing on the November 4th  ballot,' said Tony Perkins, president of the conservative  Family Research Council. 'We've made bad selections as  presidents but survived as a nation. But if we move down the  path towards the dissolution of marriage we cannot divorce  ourselves from the consequences of that.'      Episcopal Bishop Marc Andrus supports gay marriage and said  a ballot loss would slow the process -- not stop it.      Californians in 2000 passed a measure to define marriage as  between a man and a woman. At that time, the San Francisco Bay  Area was the only part of the state that supported gay  marriage, said pollster Mark DiCamillo of the Field Poll.      This year, all the coastal areas support gay marriage, and  support in the inland valleys, which have values similar to the  center of the United States, has grown but remains small.      Los Angeles County had the biggest swing, he said. 'It's  the moderates who have moved,' he said.      John Matsusaka, president of the Initiative and Referendum  Institute at the University of Southern California, said  voters, especially younger ones, were used to homosexuality.     'It doesn't have shock value any more,' Matsusaka said.      A ProtectMarriage.org flyer argues that gay marriage will  be taught in schools if the ban fails, a position their  opponents reject. Same-sex marriage supporters focus on equal  rights for all. 'People you know are asking you to vote no on  Prop. 8' a No on 8 flyer says. ",

      "Text": "    By Peter Henderson      SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Thousands of gay marriage  advocates held boisterous rallies on Saturday across the United  States and abroad in a coordinated protest of California's vote  this month to ban same-sex marriage.      In Manhattan, where some protesters were offering hula-hoop  demonstrations, Sean Petersen, 21, a musician from Brooklyn,  called the vote 'mean-spirited and divisive.'      In Chicago, Andy Thayer, a co-founder of the Gay Liberation  Network, exhorted a crowd that had listened to a gay men's  choir sing a peppy version of the hymn 'Down by the Riverside'  to follow through on the spirit of the protest.      'We can't just let this be a blowing-off-steam rally, as  satisfying as that might be,' he said. 'We're here to win equal  marriage rights right here in Illinois.'      Demonstrations had been organized for Saturday afternoon in  the United States and elsewhere, including Canada, Europe and  Australia, coordinated by a campaign on the Internet.      Los Angeles police estimated 8,000 attended, and thousands  filled the central plaza in San Francisco. Other cities had  crowds estimated in the hundreds or low thousands.      'I am here to protect my marriage and my family,' said  39-year-old Susan Ferris at Los Angeles City Hall.      On Nov. 4, California voters narrowly approved Proposition  8, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman. It  reversed the right of gays and lesbians to marry that had been  granted by the state's Supreme Court this year and triggered a  series of protests.      'A turning point has been reached,' landscape architect  James York, 45, said at the San Francisco rally.           $70 MILLION CAMPAIGN      Measures to ban gay marriage also passed in Florida and  Arizona, while Arkansas barred gay couples from adopting  children.      In 2003, Massachusetts became the first state to legalize  gay marriages. Last month, Connecticut became the second when  the state's top court overturned a ban on same-sex marriage.      The California measure passed by 52 percent after one of  the most expensive ballot campaigns in history in which both  sides combined raised some $70 million.      Gay marriage advocates have asked the California Supreme  Court to overturn the ban, arguing that more than a majority  vote is needed to make a fundamental change in the state  constitution. In May, the court had declared same-sex marriage  a right, unleashing a flood of weddings.      The rallies drew a few opponents of gay marriage.      'We're troubled by the intolerance on their side about what  obviously is the will of the American people,' Peter LaBarbera,  a board member of Protect Marriage Illinois, told Reuters. 'We  think they represent the minority viewpoint.'      Despite the setback in the country's most populous state,  gay marriage advocates said they were upbeat about their cause  in the long run.      'History is on our side,' said Ferris in Los Angeles.

      "Text": "    By Amanda Beck      SAN FRANCISCO, June 3 (Reuters) - U.S. opponents of gay  marriage pushed their campaign on both coasts this week,  setting it up as a potential hot-button issue in the Nov. 4  elections around the country.      Activists said on Tuesday California was set for its  biggest political battle in years after it was announced the  November ballot would include a constitutional amendment  limiting marriage to unions between men and women.      A similar measure also is on the November ballot in  Florida, which is likely to be closely fought in the election,  and there also are national implications.      'Values voters have even more reason to go to the polls in  2008,' said Tony Perkins, a leading religious conservative who  is president of the Family Research Council.      Initiatives to ban gay marriage played a role in President  George W. Bush's 2004 re-election as they propelled the  Republican Party's conservative Christian base to the polls.      In New York, conservative lawmakers were among those who  filed a suit against Gov. David Paterson on Tuesday, charging  that he overstepped his authority by ordering state agencies to  recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages.      California is scheduled to begin marrying gay couples later  this month but until then, Massachusetts is the only state that  allows same-sex marriage. More than 25 states have  constitutional amendments barring gay marriage.      Although Republican presidential candidate John McCain is  viewed by many religious conservatives as soft on core values  issues, gay marriage could affect turnout where it is on the  ballot.      'Which will actually be a larger draw in California? Will  the presidential choice motivate people or will the issue of  marriage motivate people?' said Ron Prentice, chairman of the  Protect Marriage Coalition, a group of 31 organizations that  are sponsoring the measure in California.      'We believe that this measure on the ballot will actually  bring significantly more people to vote,' he said.           BATTLE IN CALIFORNIA      If more than half of California voters approve the measure,  it would neutralize last month's state Supreme Court ruling  that said preventing same-sex couples from marrying was  unconstitutional and discriminatory.      'This will be the biggest battle on the West Coast since  the recall,' Randy Thomasson, president of the Campaign for  Children and Families in reference to the emotional 2003  election that recalled then-California Gov. Gray Davis.      Gay marriage opponents are urging county officials to  practice civil disobedience by refusing to marry same-sex  couples this month when the marriages are scheduled to begin.      The group behind the California ballot measure expects to  spend at least $10 million campaigning for it.      Gay marriage proponents have said they will match them  dollar-for-dollar. 'We believe that the time has passed that an  amendment like this could survive at the ballot box,' said Kate  Kendall of the National Center for Lesbian Rights.      Polls offer conflicting predictions. A Field poll published  last week showed 51 percent in favor of gay marriage with 42  percent opposed. But a Los Angeles Times poll the previous week  found 54 percent backed the amendment defining marriage as  between a man and a woman with 35 percent opposed.      Evangelical Protestants, who account for one in four  American adults, are especially keen to prohibit gay marriage,",

      "Text": "    (Adds quotes from scene.)      By Adam Tanner      SAN FRANCISCO, March 4 (Reuters) - Four years after San  Francisco ignited a heated national debate by briefly allowing  gay marriage, California's top court hears arguments on Tuesday  about whether matrimony should be limited to a man and a  woman.      The hearing brings into focus the highest-profile U.S.  fight over gay rights in recent years and the outcome could end  up influencing legislation and litigation in other states on a  matter that has been a hot-button issue in election campaigns.      'California's a bellwether state. What happens here, blows  east,' said Larry Bowler, a retired deputy sheriff from  Sacramento, who opposes gay marriage, outside the courthouse.      San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom forced the issue by  suddenly issuing gay marriage licenses in February 2004. More  than 4,000 homosexual couples took him up on the offer, before  a lower court halted the process.      California's Supreme Court ruled later that year that  Newsom, mayor of a city long at the forefront of the fight for  gay rights, had no authority to perform weddings for same-sex  couples and voided the marriages.      The same court, just across the street from City Hall,  where the gay marriages took place, now decides the larger  question whether California can legally bar same-sex  matrimony.      'We're married. We're just ready for the state and everyone  else to catch up with us,' said Davina Kotulski, who married  her partner Molly McKay in 2004 at City Hall.      'We're real people and we desire the same rights as  everyone else,' said McKay, who held a bouquet of white roses  as the couple waited to enter the court building.      Gay marriage supporters won an initial battle when a  Superior Court judge ruled in their favor in 2005. The  following year a state appeals court judge overruled that  decision and backed existing state law.      Californians in 2000 approved a ballot measure defining  marriage as the union of man and woman. But domestic  partnership legislation as of 2005 gave registered gay couples  many of the same privileges enjoyed by married couples.      California's legislature has voted twice since 2005 to  allow gay marriages, but Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a  Republican, vetoed the bills, saying voters or the courts  should decide the issue.           UNUSUAL SESSION      It now falls to the seven justices of the California  Supreme Court to resolve the matter, and they have 90 days from  Tuesday's hearing to issue an opinion. Six of the judges were  appointed by Republican governors and one by a Democrat and the  panel is considered politically moderate.      The court made a rare exception to its one-hour total limit  on oral arguments for the gay marriage case and was to hold a  three-hour session.      'Not often, but sometimes, oral arguments actually make a  difference in difficult cases and I assume that the court  considers this a difficult case,' Cruz Reynoso, a professor of  law emeritus at the University of California Davis School of  Law, who was a California Supreme Court justice from 1982-87.      More than half of U.S. states have passed constitutional  amendments barring same-sex marriage, and President George W.  Bush has proposed a U.S. Constitutional amendment to do so.      State supreme courts in Massachusetts, New Jersey and  Vermont have ruled against limiting marriage to a man and a  woman. Massachusetts became the only U.S. state",

      "Text": " (Recasts, changes dateline, adds new details throughout)      By Ted Lorson      HARTFORD, Conn., Oct 10 (Reuters) - Connecticut's highest  court on Friday unexpectedly struck down a ban on gay and  lesbian marriage, making the New England state the third in the  nation to allow full-fledged marriage for same-sex couples.      After four years of legal wrangling in the state court  system, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that a ban on  gay marriage constituted 'cognizable harm' and infringed on a  'fundamental right' of same-sex couples.      The decision, which overturns a lower court ruling, follows  the legalization of gay marriage in California this year and in  Massachusetts in 2003. It was hailed by gay rights advocates as  a proud day after battles over the culturally divisive issue in  several states.      Connecticut Gov. Jodi Rell, a Republican, disagreed with  the ruling but said she will uphold it.      'I continue to believe that marriage is the union of a man  and a woman,' Rell said. 'I do not believe their voice reflects  the majority of the people of Connecticut.'      She said she was convinced that any attempt to reverse the  decision, either legislatively or by amending the state  Constitution, would fail.      The decision came as a surprise after previous courts  upheld the ban and lawmakers wrote specific language into a  civil union measure defining marriage as between men and  women.      Connecticut was one of four U.S. states that permits  same-sex civil unions that grant rights such as insurance  coverage, tax benefits and hospital visitations. But these lack  the full, federal legal protections of marriage.      Opponents of gay marriage said they would seek to overturn  the ruling by persuading voters to support a ballot measure   next month that would open a state constitutional convention to  address the issue of same-sex marriage.      'Then we will put a question on the ballot to allow the  public, not our robed masters, to decide once and for all if  marriage will be protected in our state constitution as the  union between a man and a woman,' said Peter Wolfgang,  president of the Family Institute of Connecticut, a  conservative Christian group.        'WE ARE OVERJOYED'      The plaintiffs in the case -- eight same-sex couples --  challenged the lower court's ruling that civil unions give  same-sex couples the same rights and protections as marriage.      They argued that their constitutional rights were denied  when they were barred from getting marriage licenses.      'We are overjoyed to tell our twin boys that we will be  married, just like their friends' parents,' Beth Kerrigan and  Jodie Mock, two plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement.      The date when the decision takes effect depends on a trial  court order that is expected after Oct. 28, said Connecticut  Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.      'It won't take effect immediately but probably in the next  month or so,' he said in a telephone interview.      When Massachusetts' top court overturned a ban on gay  marriage in 2003, opposition was so strong that it drove  religious conservatives to the polls in 2004, a factor in the  re-election of President George W. Bush.      But this year, just three weeks before the U.S.  presidential election, national reaction was relatively muted  as the news fought for air time with turmoil in financial  markets, tumbling stock prices and signs of a possible global  recession.

Claiming that opponents of gay marriage are twisting the  truth and trying to scare voters, DeGeneres will appeal in a  television ad to vote for equality, compassion and fairness.      The chat show host and comic actress wed her long time  partner, actress Portia de Rossi, in August in the most  high-profile same-sex marriage since such unions were declared  legal in California in May.      Her message will be broadcast on television as celebrities  step up the fight to defeat Proposition 8 on the Nov.4 state  ballot that seeks to define marriage under the California  constitution as only between a man and a woman.      'Hi, I'm Ellen DeGeneres.  I got to do something this year  I never thought I'd ever be able to do: I got married. It was  the happiest day of my life. There are people out there raising  millions of dollars to try and take that right away from me.      'You've seen their ads on TV. They're twisting the truth,  and they're trying to scare you. I believe in fairness.  I  believe in compassion. I believe in equality for all people.  Proposition 8 does not. Please, please, vote no on Prop. 8,'  the actress says in her appeal.      In recent weeks, opinion polls have shown a swing in the  number of Californians who oppose same-sex marriage. Their  campaign has raised $25.4 million, compared with $15.8 million  for those who wish to maintain the right to gay marriage.      Opponents of same-sex marriage have stepped up their  television advertising, warning that children will be taught  about gay marriage in elementary schools.      Gay-marriage supporters call that argument misleading.      Singers Melissa Etheridge, who plans to marry partner Tammy  Tammy Lynn Michaels, and Mary J. Blige will perform at a  $25,000-a-plate dinner in Beverly Hills on Tuesday in support  of the 'No' campaign.

The court found that the state's law limiting marriage to  heterosexual couples discriminates on the basis of sexual  orientation.

      "Text": "    By Peter Henderson      SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Same-sex marriage  advocates plan to 'Call in gay' on Wednesday in a protest  designed to show Americans how big a part of daily life -- and  the economy -- gays and their supporters are.      The Internet-organized project, which follows California's  passage of anti-same-sex-marriage Proposition 8, urges 'Day  Without a Gay' participants to skip work and volunteer in the  community.      The idea is creating a controversy over how to garner  support without protesters hurting their cause.      Californians struck down same-sex marriage last month,  reversing a court decision that had affirmed the right. The  Nov. 4 vote stopped gay unions in California -- one of a  handful of states, provinces and mostly European countries that  allowed it.      After the vote, protest marches targeted U.S. temples of  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Mormons,  who were top supporters of California Proposition 8, which  limits marriage to a man and a woman. That led to a nationwide  protest day on Nov. 15.      'In order for this movement to continue it can't just be  about marching and being pissed off. It's got to be creative in  different ways to get into the hearts and minds of moderate  voters,' said daywithoutagay.org creator Sean Hetherington.      The Los Angeles comedian and his boyfriend, Aaron Hartzler,  put the focus on volunteering, although one of the groups  behind the Nov. 15 rallies, jointheimpact.com, urges people to  shut businesses and avoid spending anything.      The protest appears inspired by the 2004 film 'A Day  Without a Mexican' which imagines the effect on California of a  day when there are no Latinos, leading to chaos on the state.

      "Text": "    By Jill Serjeant      LOS ANGELES, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Hollywood, long considered a  bastion of liberal thinking, is being chided for not opening  its wallet to save the right to same-sex marriage in California  even as several A-list gays and lesbians rush to the altar.      With a month to go before a Nov. 4 referendum seeking to  abolish the newly won right of same-sex couples to marry in  California, some in the entertainment community are anxious  that more of their own are not supporting gay rights by  donating money to defeat the proposed ban.      So far, the largest celebrity donations have come from  actor Brad Pitt and director Steven Spielberg who each  contributed $100,000 each last month to help defeat the ballot  proposal, known as Proposition 8.      'We are concerned that the entertainment industry hasn't  stepped up to the plate to fight this unnecessary initiative  ... Now it's time for the entertainment industry as a whole to  take the lead,' activist Jonathan Lewis said on Wednesday.      Lewis, an entrepreneur from Ohio, said his family would  match the next $500,000 that entertainment industry leaders  contribute to the 'No on Prop 8' campaign.      Hundreds of gays and lesbians have married since a May  decision by the California Supreme Court overturning a state  ban on same-sex marriage.      But opponents of the ruling put the issue up for a  state-wide referendum that seeks to amend the California  constitution to allow marriage only between a man and a woman.      Recent opinion polls show that 38 percent of California  voters would support a ban on same-sex marriage with 55 percent  opposed. But supporters of the ban, including several religious  and conservative groups, have edged ahead in fund-raising.        CELEBRITY SIDE EFFECTS      By late September, opponents of gay marriage had raised  $14.7 million, while supporters brought in $13.5 million,  according the official records.      An article in the Los Angeles gay magazine In-LA last month  headlined 'Mega A-Gays Missing in Fight Against Prop 8' noted  that state records show Ellen DeGeneres, Portia de Rossi,  Melissa Etheridge, Rosie O'Donnell and international gays such  as Elton John have not contributed any cash.      But many in Hollywood also argue that the high-profile  wedding of popular chat show host DeGeneres to actress de Rossi  in August brought the kind of publicity money cannot buy.      DeGeneres, who in 1997 became the first openly gay lead  character on U.S. prime-time network TV, also has used her talk  show and an appearance on 'The Tonight Show with Jay Leno' to  urge Californians to maintain same-sex marriage.       Still, says Steve Smith, a consultant for the 'No on Prop  8' campaign, money is important.      'California is a very expensive state to communicate with  voters. Celebrity money in some ways goes a little further. It  gets more reported and that adds to the benefit of the  contribution itself,' Smith said.      'My guess is that after Pitt and Spielberg's donations we  are going to see more of that money,' Smith added.      To bolster its funds, the 'No on Prop 8' campaign will hold  an entertainment industry fundraiser this month.      However, celebrity giving can backfire.      'On word that Brad Pitt had donated $100,000 to the No  campaign, we had an individual who read that and himself  donated $100,000 to us,' said Jennifer Kearns, spokeswoman for  the 'Yes on Prop 8' campaign. 'So sometimes the high-prof",

      "Text": "(Repeats due to technical problem)      By Peter Henderson      LOS ANGELES, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Gay couples are not hiding  any more and that has made all the difference, said health care  administrator Linda Merkens before Tuesday's vote in California  that will decide the legality of same-sex marriage there.      It's one of several important ballot measures voters will  face in states across the country on Election Day.      'A lot more gays are more open about their relationships,  and a lot more people are willing to accept it,' Merkens said  in downtown Los Angeles recently.      Other passersby disagreed. 'Same sex marriage is a sin,'  said city planner Kim Chan.      Tuesday's results will show how far attitudes to gay  marriage have changed. Florida and Arizona will join California  in voting on whether to stop gay marriage.      In the past, such propositions have almost always been  approved, but polls show a close finish in California and many  undecided in all three states.      Legal abortion also faces a key challenge as South Dakotans  consider a measure to severely restrict the procedure. If it  passes, opponents are expected to challenge it all the way to  the U.S. Supreme Court. A poll by the state Argus Leader  newspaper showed that vote a toss-up.      Altogether, 150 measures in about 35 states will be put to  the vote on the same day the next U.S. president is chosen,  with other issues ranging from affirmative action to how farm  animals are treated. [ID:nN01396494].      A California court in May rejected limiting marriage to a  man and a woman. Only a few nations and states agree.      Now Hollywood stars like Brad Pitt are facing off with  conservative foes like the fast-growing Mormon church, the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, over Proposition  8, which would ban same-sex marriage.      Both sides have broad, deep pockets: ban proponents have  raised about $30 million, and opponents recently topped that.           MORE IMPORTANT THAN PRESIDENCY      'This is the most important thing on the November 4th  ballot,' said Tony Perkins, president of the conservative  Family Research Council. 'We've made bad selections as  presidents but survived as a nation. But if we move down the  path towards the dissolution of marriage we cannot divorce  ourselves from the consequences of that.'      Episcopal Bishop Marc Andrus supports gay marriage and said  a ballot loss would slow the process -- not stop it.      Californians in 2000 passed a measure to define marriage as  between a man and a woman. At that time, the San Francisco Bay  Area was the only part of the state that supported gay  marriage, said pollster Mark DiCamillo of the Field Poll.      This year, all the coastal areas support gay marriage, and  support in the inland valleys, which have values similar to the  center of the United States, has grown but remains small.      Los Angeles County had the biggest swing, he said. 'It's  the moderates who have moved,' he said.      John Matsusaka, president of the Initiative and Referendum  Institute at the University of Southern California, said  voters, especially younger ones, were used to homosexuality.     'It doesn't have shock value any more,' Matsusaka said.      A ProtectMarriage.org flyer argues that gay marriage will  be taught in schools if the ban fails, a position their  opponents reject. Same-sex marriage supporters focus on equal  rights for all. 'People you know are asking you to vote no",

      "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Several thousand people  gathered in Los Angeles on Saturday evening to protest a  voter-approved ballot measure that bans same-sex marriage in  California.      A diverse crowd, estimated at 5,000, stretched for blocks  in the Silver Lake district, east of Hollywood, carrying signs  and chanting against Proposition 8, a constitutional amendment  that bars the state from recognizing same-sex marriages.      'Equal rights,' the protesters chanted, 'When do we want it?  Now!'      The measure overturned a California Supreme Court ruling in  May that refusing homosexuals the right to marry violated the  state constitution. Voters in Florida and Arizona joined  California on Tuesday in banning same-sex marriages.      Dozens of states have similar laws. Only two U.S. states,  Massachusetts and Connecticut, allow same-sex marriage.      Many of the protesters' signs mocked the Mormon church, which  spent millions promoting the measure, helping make it one of the  most expensive ballot campaigns in U.S. history.      Others expressed despair the gay community had not benefited  from U.S. President-elect Barack Obama's lopsided election  victory.      'Yes we can (unless you're gay),' read one sign.      The march began at Sunset Junction, once a strip of bars  where the U.S. gay community first made a stand against police  harassment in the late 1960s.      The action was one of a number of largely peaceful protests  that took place across the state on Saturday, and have clogged  Los Angeles streets every night since the proposition passed.           HISTORIC PLACE      'This is a historic place for the  (lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender) community,' said Ian  Thompson, spokesman for protest organizer the ANSWER Coalition.  'We are remembering the fact that the gay community started  standing up for itself here. People are just very angry.'      Activists, both gay and straight, listened to speakers and  marched about a 1 mile (1.6 km) through Silver Lake, watched by  police on horseback and several hovering helicopters.      Participants in the rally included Robin Tyler and Diane  Olson, a lesbian couple whose lawsuit led the state Supreme Court  to permit more than 18,000 couples to marry over the summer. Those  couples now find their unions in legal limbo. California state law  recognizes civil unions between gays and lesbians.      Supporters of the proposition argued that gay marriage  would be taught in schools if the ban failed, a position that  opponents of the ban reject.      Tyler and Olson had their attorney file a writ with the  high court on Wednesday challenging the initiative. Civil  rights groups have filed another lawsuit and leaders of some  California cities were contemplating joining those actions.      The ballot measure, whose campaign drew a record total of  $70 million in contributions from supporters and opponents,  amended the state constitution to add, 'Only marriage between a  man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.'

      "Text": "    May 15 (Reuters) - The California Supreme Court ruled on  Thursday the state cannot bar same-sex marriages, marking a  major victory for gay rights advocates that may have national  implications.      Here is a look at laws on gay marriage and same-sex civil  unions in the United States:      * Massachusetts is the only U.S. state to allow gay  marriage. Its highest court ruled in 2003 that a ban on gay  marriage was unconstitutional, paving the way for America's  first same-sex marriages the following year.      * Connecticut, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Vermont permit  same-sex civil unions that grant largely the same state rights  as married couples -- from insurance coverage to tax benefits  and hospital visiting rights -- but lack the full, federal  legal protections of marriage.      * California, Maine, the District of Columbia, Hawaii and  Washington each offer gay couples some legal rights as  partners.      * Currently, 45 states have laws explicitly prohibiting  same-sex marriage, including 26 with constitutional amendments  restricting marriage to one man and one woman and 19 with  statutory laws barring same-sex unions.      * The patchwork of laws has caused some unusual  complications. Rhode Island's top court, for example, ruled in  December 2007 that a same-sex couple married in Massachusetts  could not legally divorce in Rhode Island, saying the state's  family court did not have authority over same-sex marriages.      * Massachusetts currently allows out-of-state same-sex  couples from just two states -- Rhode Island and New Mexico --  to marry there, since those states' laws do not clearly  prohibit gay marriage.      * More than 8,000 same-sex couples have married in  Massachusetts.      * The U.S. Supreme Court has not taken a case on gay  marriage, leaving states to decide the issue.      * The Arizona House of Representatives voted 33-25 on May  13 to put a proposed constitutional amendment to prohibit  same-sex marriage on the statewide ballot in November.

      "Text": "    By Jason Szep      BOSTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - A Maine lawmaker introduced a  bill on Tuesday to legalize same-sex marriage, but it looks set  to face tough opposition and bring a rancorous fight over the  definition of marriage to the rugged eastern state.      The legislation proposed by Democratic state Sen. Dennis  Damonck would make the state the nation's third to allow  same-sex marriage. It seeks to redefine marriage as the legal  union of two people rather than between a man and a women.      'Today I have submitted an act to end discrimination in  civil marriage and to affirm religious freedom,' he told a news  conference in the state capital Augusta.      As he spoke, Republican Rep. John Tardy was drafting  legislation to enshrine the definition of marriage as one man  and one woman into the state constitution. 'The language is  being worked on now,' his spokesman said.      The looming fight in Maine, a rural state of 1.3 million  people with a Democratic-controlled legislature, underlines a  concerted push for same-sex marriage recognition in New  England's six states by gay and lesbian advocates -- a bid that  would effectively create a regional niche for gay marriage.      In November, Connecticut became the second U.S. state to  allow legal same-sex weddings after Massachusetts' top court  ruled in 2003 that a ban on gay marriage was unconstitutional,  paving the way for same-sex marriages the following year.      On Friday, New Hampshire Rep. Jim Splaine signed off on  legislation proposing same-sex marriage in that state, which  borders both Maine and Massachusetts. He said he expected the  bill to come up for a public hearing in two or three weeks.      Five of New England's six states already offer same-sex  couples some form of legal recognition, with New Hampshire and  Vermont permitting same-sex civil unions that grant many of the  same rights as married couples but lack the full legal  protections of marriage.      'I think it is important to make our civil unions have full  marriage equality with the word 'marriage' so that it is clear  that we do not discriminate and that we welcome same-gendered  couples,' Splaine told Reuters in an interview.      Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, a group of lawyers who  led the legal fight for same-sex marriage in Massachusetts and  Connecticut, said on Tuesday similar legislation was being  drafted in Rhode Island and Vermont.      The group has set a target of bringing same-sex marriage   to all six New England states by 2012.      Some economists say carving out an economic niche for gay  and lesbian weddings -- and the spending that comes with them  -- makes sense at a time same-sex marriage has stalled in  California and a recession is deepening.      M.V. Lee Badgett, an economist at the University of  Massachusetts' Institute for Gay and Lesbian Strategic Studies,  led a study released in July that said over the next three  years about 32,200 same-sex couples would travel from other  states to marry in Massachusetts.      That would translate into 330 jobs and a $111 million boost  to the state's economy, the study projects.

      "Text": "    By Axel Bugge      LISBON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Portugal's parliament rejected a  proposal on Friday to allow gay marriage, sparking anger among  gays who say they face discrimination in the conservative  Catholic country.      The proposal by the small Left Bloc and Green parties to  overturn an existing ban was overwhelmingly rejected as the  ruling Socialists, who hold a majority, joined the centre-right  opposition in opposing the move.      Parliament president Jaime Gaime did not give a final vote  breakdown but said the proposal had been rejected, the  legislature's television channel showed.      Outside parliament, about thirty gays protested by staging  two mock marriages.      'I am here because there are citizens who are full citizens  in their duties but not citizens in their rights and that is a  very serious mistake in a democracy,' Joana, a woman who married  her partner, told Reuters Television.      'Old homophobes!' a gay protester shouted inside the voting  chamber after the vote, before being led out by police.      Gays were encouraged that a referendum in Portugal last year  overturned a ban on abortion, hoping it would usher in what they  see as more progressive and modern values elsewhere in Europe.  Neighbouring Spain has allowed gay marriages since 2005.      But Catholic values still hold sway on many social issues in  Portugal. Cardinal Jose Policarpo, the patriarch of Lisbon,  warned that allowing gay marriages would be a violation of the  family.      'What is in question is breaking the profound conception of  the family,' he said on Radio Renascenca, a Catholic radio  station.      Alice Ferreira, a 70-year-old pensioner, told SIC television  that gays could have their own sexual preferences but they  should not be allowed to marry.      'I don't think they could be real marriages because  marriages are intended to create families,' she said.      Supporters of the change argue that the ban on gay marriage  included in Portugal's civil code is illegal under the 1975  constitution, which bans sexual discrimination.      Polls have shown under 30 percent of Portuguese approve of  gay marriage against an average around 45 percent in the  European Union, according to Eurobarometer.

      "Text": " (Updates with White House reaction, paragraphs 11-13)      By Ted Lorson      HARTFORD, Conn., Oct 10 (Reuters) - Connecticut's highest  court on Friday unexpectedly struck down a ban on gay and  lesbian marriage, making the New England state the third in the  nation to allow full-fledged marriage for same-sex couples.      After four years of legal wrangling in the state court  system, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that a ban on  gay marriage constituted 'cognizable harm' and infringed on a  'fundamental right' of same-sex couples.      The decision, which overturns a lower court ruling, follows  the legalization of gay marriage in California this year and in  Massachusetts in 2003. It was hailed by gay rights advocates as  a proud day after battles over the culturally divisive issue in  several states.      Connecticut Gov. Jodi Rell, a Republican, disagreed with  the ruling but said she will uphold it.      'I continue to believe that marriage is the union of a man  and a woman,' Rell said. 'I do not believe their voice reflects  the majority of the people of Connecticut.'      She said she was convinced that any attempt to reverse the  decision, either legislatively or by amending the state  Constitution, would fail.      The decision came as a surprise after previous courts  upheld the ban and lawmakers wrote specific language into a  civil union measure defining marriage as between men and  women.      Connecticut was one of four U.S. states that permits  same-sex civil unions that grant rights such as insurance  coverage, tax benefits and hospital visitations. But these lack  the full, federal legal protections of marriage.      Opponents of gay marriage said they would seek to overturn  the ruling by persuading voters to support a ballot measure   next month that would open a state constitutional convention to  address the issue of same-sex marriage.      'Then we will put a question on the ballot to allow the  public, not our robed masters, to decide once and for all if  marriage will be protected in our state constitution as the  union between a man and a woman,' said Peter Wolfgang,  president of the Family Institute of Connecticut, a  conservative Christian group.      Karl Zinsmeister, President George W. Bush's assistant for  domestic policy, issued a statement criticizing the decision  late on Friday.      'President Bush has always believed that marriage is a  sacred institution between a man and a woman.      'It's unfortunate that activist judges continue to seek to  redefine marriage by court order without regard for the will of  the people. Today's decision by the Connecticut Supreme Court  illustrates that a federal constitutional amendment may be  needed if the people are to decide what marriage means.'        'WE ARE OVERJOYED'      The plaintiffs in the case -- eight same-sex couples --  challenged the lower court's ruling that civil unions give  same-sex couples the same rights and protections as marriage.      They argued that their constitutional rights were denied  when they were barred from getting marriage licenses.      'We are overjoyed to tell our twin boys that we will be  married, just like their friends' parents,' Beth Kerrigan and  Jodie Mock, two plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement.      The date when the decision takes effect depends on a trial  court order that is expected after Oct. 28, said Connecticut  Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.      'It won't take effect immediatel",

      "Text": "    Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama signed  executive orders on Thursday to close Guantanamo military  prison and overseas CIA jails.      He also ordered more humane treatment for terrorism  suspects and an end to renditions, the practice of transporting  foreign detainees to other countries for interrogation that has  caused friction with close allies.      Here are details of the three orders Obama signed:           EXECUTIVE ORDER ON GUANTANAMO BAY DETAINEES      The prison at a U.S. naval base in Cuba, where hundreds of  foreign terrorism suspects have been held for years without  trial, is to be closed within a year.      'Closure of the facility is the ultimate goal but not the  first step. The order establishes a review process with the  goal of disposing of the detainees before closing the  facility,' the order says.      There is to be an immediate review to determine whether the  250 detainees still at Guantanamo can be transferred to third  countries. It instructs Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to  negotiate transfers with foreign countries. If the transfers  are not approved, a second review will decide whether  prosecutions are possible and in what forum.      'The preference is for prosecution in Article III courts or  under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, but military  commissions, perhaps with revised authorities, would remain an  option,' it says.      The order directs Defense Secretary Robert Gates to halt  all military commission proceedings pending the review and to  ensure detainees are held in conditions that comply with the  Geneva Conventions on the humane treatment of prisoners.           EXECUTIVE ORDER ON INTERROGATIONS      It requires all questioning of detainees, by any U.S.  government agency, to follow the Army Field Manual  interrogation guidelines, which ensure prisoners get humane  treatment under the Geneva Conventions.      It junks the legal advice on interrogations issued by the  Bush administration, which said that terrorism suspects were  not entitled to protection under the Geneva Conventions.      It orders the CIA to close all detention facilities, set up  in third countries to interrogate foreign terrorism suspects.      It also orders establishment of a special task force to  review the policy of rendition to ensure that individuals do  not face torture or cruel treatment.      The task force will also conduct a review of the Army Field  Manual interrogation guidelines to determine 'whether different  or additional guidance is necessary for the CIA.'           PRESIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM ON THE DETENTION OF ALI AL-MARRI      Obama ordered a review of the status of Marri, accused of  being an al Qaeda 'sleeper' agent and held for 5-1/2 years at a  U.S. military prison in South Carolina. He is the only person  still held in the United States as an enemy combatant.

      "Text": "    NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - A new Justice Department  report praises FBI agents for refusing to join in the U.S.  military's abusive questioning of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay,  Iraq and Afghanistan, but faults the bureau's for responding  slowly to complaints from its own agents about the tactics, The  New York Times reported on Saturday.      Citing people with knowledge of the still-secret report,  expected to be released as early as Tuesday, the Times reported  that the department's inspector general's office is said to  have concluded that no FBI agents participated in the rough  interrogations by the military.      But the report is also expected to take the bureau to task  for its slow response to agents' complaints about the tactics,  and for its unclear guidelines and training on handling the  complaints, the Times said.      'The FBI should be credited for its conduct and  professionalism in detainee interrogations in the military  zones,' the newspaper quoted the inspector general as saying in  the report.      One FBI memo referred to 'torture techniques' that were  used by military interrogators, with agents describing inmates  who were handcuffed in a fetal position for up to 24 hours at a  time, the newspaper reported. They were intimidated by dogs,  made to wear women's undergarments and subjected to strobe  lights and extreme temperatures, it said.      'Could we have done more, more quickly? Or could we have  provided better guidance?' asked an FBI official with knowledge  of the report who said the answer was likely yes. But, he  added, 'It was difficult to tell agents what the rules were  because we didn't know ourselves,' the Times reported.      The inspector general's office refused to comment on the  investigation, which began more than three years ago, and many  details remain unknown, the Times said, including whether it  will address CIA interrogations that may have been witnessed by  FBI agents.      FBI Director Robert Mueller said on Friday that the agency  was helping to get information from detainees and prepare  terrorism cases against suspects at Guantanamo Bay despite  differences with the CIA over interrogation techniques.      'The policy of the bureau ... is not to use coercion,' he  said in an appearance at the National Press Club, adding 'I  will speak for the FBI.'

      "Text": "    WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense  Department is reviewing the practice of videotaping  interrogations with the aim of developing a uniform policy on  recording those sessions, the Pentagon said on Thursday.      The U.S. military does not regularly videotape  interrogations and so far its review has found fewer than 50  tapes, according to Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell.      The recordings are typically destroyed after 90 days, once  interrogators and other military officials determine the  videotapes no longer serve any intelligence or training  purpose, the Pentagon said.      'Once the tape has outlived its usefulness, it is certainly  within the rights, in fact I think it's within the orders of  some divisions, to destroy those tapes,' Morrell said.      The Pentagon's top intelligence official, Undersecretary of  Defense for Intelligence James Clapper, in late January ordered  military commands to report their videotaping practices.      That came after the Central Intelligence Agency  acknowledged it destroyed videotapes of harsh interrogations  conducted by CIA officers. The destruction of those tapes is  the subject of criminal and congressional investigations.      'We want to know to what extent that they are using  videotaping, when they choose to preserve it, when they choose  to destroy it, what are the criteria they use for making those  decisions,' Morrell said.      'The effort here is to try to ... ensure that we have a  uniform use, policy with regards to videotaping.'      The videotapes would be kept if there was any evidence of  abuse during the interrogations, Morrell said.      The Pentagon would not discuss the content of the tapes.      The New York Times, which first reported the review of  videotaping practices, said one of the tapes showed what a  military spokesman described as the forcible gagging of a  terrorism suspect.      In that case, interrogators used force to put duct tape  over the mouth of a detainee, the newspaper said.      Morrell would not say whether that practice was abusive.      'I'm not going to go into what's abuse or not abuse. I  would talk to people who are experts on interrogation. I doubt  that they would characterize what you're describing as abuse,'  he said.      Many of the tapes documented interrogations of Jose  Padilla, the newspaper said. Padilla is a Chicago gang member  once accused of plotting a radioactive bomb attack, but  sentenced in January to more than 17 years in prison for  supporting terrorism.      The U.S. military organizes itself into geographic and  functional commands, four of which were ordered to report on  their videotaping practices.      That included U.S. Southern Command, responsible for the  military prison holding al Qaeda and Taliban suspects at the  naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Central Command,  responsible for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.      All except Central Command have completed the review.

      "Text": "The truth about Guantanamo Bay: that is the subject of this evening's \"Talking Points Memo\".\n\nAs we told you last week, the detainee abuse story is being used to undermine the war on terror, at least the way the Bush administration is fighting it. Check out my column posted on billoreilly.com for details on that.\n\nNow over the weekend, Senator Joseph Biden joined the abuse chorus and called for the shutting down of Guantanamo Bay (search).\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. JOSEPH BIDEN (D), DELAWARE: [It]...has become the greatest propaganda tool that exists for recruiting of terrorists around the world. And it is unnecessary to be in that position, but the end result is I think we should end up shutting it down, moving those prisoners. Those that we have reason to keep, keep. And those we don't, let go.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWe asked the senator to appear this evening, but as always, Biden turned us down. He does not like close questioning.\n\nBut it's amazing to me that he and others actually believe that closing Gitmo would accomplish anything. The entire Gitmo situation has been driven by the anti-Bush press and the far left human rights organizations.\n\nAs \"Talking Points\" mentioned a week ago, there have been abuses by U.S. interrogators down there, but not many. And now we have some stats to back that up.\n\nThe Pentagon report found that there have been more than 28,000 Gitmo interrogations over the past three years, and only five cases of Koran abuse, two of which were accidental.\n\nAnd the chief critic from inside Gitmo, former Army translator Eric Saar (search), said this on \u201cThe Factor\u201d a few days ago.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO'REILLY: What was the worst thing you ever saw?\n\nERIC SAAR: You know, sir, I would have to say the worst thing I saw was actually some of the sexual tactics that were used in the interrogation booth. And I would have to say the reason for that is because it really defied the values we stand for as a country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAnd those techniques were unbuttoning blouses, women interrogators, things like that, but no touching or anything like that.\n\nSo what are we talking about here? Some minor cases of abuse, that's what. And we should shut down Gitmo because the anti-Bush press doesn't like it? Come on.\n\nThe truth is that any closing of Gitmo would send a signal that the USA did indeed abuse Gitmo prisoners on a mass scale. That's not true, but it is a perception the anti-Bush people want out there.\n\nOnce again, you can't fight a war on terror when every small mistake is magnified into a page one scandal or a book! Also once again, the Bush administration should set up an independent commission to investigate American detainee policy across the board. The president must take the offensive on this, or else the country's image will continue to suffer and the jihadists and their enablers will win another victory.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nThe Most Ridiculous Item of the Day\n\nA bunch of \"Factor\" items: First the results of our billoreilly.com poll, which asks, \"Is Mark Felt aka Deep Throat, a hero, a villain, or is it too hard to say?\"\n\nSixty-four percent of the 25,000 of you who voted believe the man's a villain. Twenty-four percent say it is too hard to say. And just 12 percent think he's a hero. Very interesting.\n\nSecond, the lead item in Liz Smith's column today was about \"The Factor's\" investigation into the money Angelina Jolie (search), the actress, reportedly donated to help third world causes through the U.N.\n\nMs. Smith writes, quote, \"On the heels of the oil-for-food scan (search)dal, is there a chance that Angelina is being taken for a ride by some in the United Nations? Bill O'Reilly says he will answer that question. Soon.\"\n\nWell, that's true, we're finishing up our investigation into Ms. Jolie's donations. It's very fascinating. The story is probably going to be on Thursday, but we want to be certain so we're taking the time to echeck everything. Rechecking is never ridiculous.\n\n\u2014You can watch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Most Ridiculous Item\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel.

      "Text": "    TOKYO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Japan tightened rules for police  interrogations on Thursday, barring officers from touching  suspects or grilling them for long hours after several cases in  which the accused were later found to be innocent.      All interrogation rooms should be equipped with see-through  mirrors so questioning can be monitored from outside, while  verbal abuse will also not be allowed, a statement by the  National Police Agency said.      The new rules follow recent high-profile cases in which  suspects were forced into making confessions.      In 2003, 13 people were arrested and indicted in a  vote-buying scandal in southern Japan but they were later  acquitted by a district court which said their confessions had  been forced and lacked credibility.      The National Police Agency said recent acquittals had hurt  the public's confidence in their practices.      'With these guidelines, we will do our best to strengthen the  public's trust in police interrogations,' it said.      In Japan, about 99.9 percent of indictments lead to  convictions, an astounding success rate that critics say is a  symptom of problems in the criminal justice system.      Most criminal trials are based on confessions extracted in a  detention period which can last 23 days without charge, during  which no sound or video recordings are made.      The justice system is undergoing a gradual transformation,  however, with video recording of interrogations having begun on a  small-scale trial basis.      Japan is also to introduce a lay judge system by 2009 that  will make ordinary citizens a part of the trial of serious  crimes, a move the National Police Agency said raised the urgency  for officers to improve their interrogation methods.

      "Text": " (Updates with comments after closed congressional hearing)      By Randall Mikkelsen      ST. MARY'S CITY, Md., Jan 16 (Reuters) - The CIA's harsh  questioning of terrorism suspects was legal and saved lives,  the U.S. national intelligence director said on Wednesday, as  Congress questioned a CIA lawyer about the agency's destruction  of interrogation videotapes.      'It has saved lives. And so from my point of view, we've  accomplished the mission within the bounds of U.S. law,' the  director, Michael McConnell, told students at St. Mary's  College in Maryland.      The CIA's disclosure last month it destroyed hundreds of  hours of videotapes depicting harsh interrogations, believed to  have included a simulated form of drowning called  waterboarding, cast U.S. treatment of terrorism suspects under  the spotlight and drew criticism from human rights groups.      Waterboarding has been condemned internationally as a form  of illegal torture, and McConnell was quoted in the current  issue of The New Yorker magazine as saying he would consider  the practice torture if it were applied to him.      'The United States does not engage in torture. We do use  enhanced interrogation techniques,' McConnell said. 'There are  Americans today that are alive, that are living and breathing  because of those interrogation techniques.'      While McConnell spoke, the House of Representatives  Intelligence Committee met behind closed doors to question CIA  attorney John Rizzo, who is reported to have been involved in  the decision to destroy the tapes. The recordings depicted the  interrogations of two suspected al Qaeda members in 2002, and  the tapes were destroyed in 2005.      The committee had also subpoenaed Jose Rodriguez, the  former head of the CIA's clandestine branch who is believed to  have made the decision to destroy the tapes.      But the panel decided against calling him to testify after  his attorney indicated Rodriguez would not answer questions, a  House aide said. He remains under subpoena and may be called in  the future to testify.      Rep. Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, the committee's ranking  Republican, told reporters after the hearing with Rizzo, 'We  need to get Jose Rodriguez in here to testify.'      'Jose was responsible for this -- or it appears that most  press reports and other reports indicate that Jose was  responsible for this decision to destroy the tapes,' Hoekstra  said.      The Washington Post reported that CIA lawyers and officials  told Rodriguez he had the legal right to order the  destruction.      Hoekstra and Intelligence Committee Chairman Silvestre  Reyes, a Texas Democrat, said Rizzo was a cooperative witness.  They did not disclose specifics.      Reyes said in a statement: 'We will be identifying  additional officials to talk to in the coming days and weeks. I  urge members of the executive branch to cooperate with this  investigation and let the truth be told.'      The Justice Department has launched a criminal  investigation, and sought to discourage congressional probes,  fearing they could undermine its efforts.      Human rights activists and some intelligence analysts and  congressional critics have questioned the validity of  information gained under harsh interrogations and called for a  ban on waterboarding. McConnell said it was important to keep  suspects guessing about the techniques they would face.   (Additional reporting by Thomas Ferraro in Washington; Editing  by Peter Cooney)   ((R",

'We kept our promise to give prisoners a second chance,'  Justice Minister Sotiris Hatzigakis said after parliament  approved the law.      Amnesty International said in a report this year that  Greece's prisons were overcrowded, had a poor standard of  hygiene and that ill-treatment of prisoners was widely reported.      About 6,500 prisoners ended their protest in late November.      Hatzigakis, who had praised the inmates for ending their  protest peacefully, said the ministry wanted prisoners to be  able to spend Christmas with their families.      But prisoner rights organisations said it was a short-term  solution.      'The prisoners are disappointed,' said Annita Michaelidou,  member of the Initiative for Prisoners Rights. 'Releasing  thousands of prisoners just for one time doesn't solve the  problem in the long run.'

      "Text": "    JERUSALEM, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Israel has decided to delay the  release of 230 Palestinian prisoners until Dec. 15, a week later  than planned, Israeli and Palestinian officials said on Monday.      Saeb Erekat, an aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas,  said the delay stemmed from legal issues on the Israeli side.      But Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,  said the delay had been coordinated with Abbas, who was  attending the haj pilgrimage in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.      The prisoners make up only a fraction of the 11,000  Palestinians held by Israel. The release, meant as a goodwill  gesture to Abbas, had been scheduled for Tuesday to coincide  with the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha.      Israel announced last month that it would free 250  prisoners, but officials said a ministerial committee on Sunday  approved a list of only 230 names.      Olmert's office said the prisoners would come from the ranks  of Abbas's Fatah secular faction and other non-Islamist groups.      Such releases are highly emotive for Palestinians, who  regard prisoners as symbols of resistance to Israeli occupation.      Israel freed nearly 200 prisoners in August.      U.S.-sponsored peace talks between Olmert and Abbas,  rejected by Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Gaza  Strip, have shown little sign of progress.

Number one, those Europeans have no idea who these people are and what they've done, because that information's being kept secret.\n\nNumber two, these are not prisoners of war, they're criminals. If they're in chains, it's because they're violent. If they are made to kneel down, it's because of security concerns.\n\nOnce again, people who kill or condone the killing of civilians in a sneak attack aren't soldiers, they are criminals, with no Geneva Convention rights. And what's up with the Red Cross? As the ABC News commentator Paul Harvey pointed out today on the radio, took the Red Cross months before it got some of the donated money to the 9/11 families, but just days before it began criticizing America's treatment of the Muslim criminals. What's wrong with the Red Cross these days? Has that agency been hijacked by ideological nitwits?\n\nI think America has been too soft on the captured terrorists. They're getting much better treatment than the Taliban provided them. We need information from these people. We need intense interrogations. This isn't some touchy-feely encounter group going on here, these prisoners support the destruction of America and the vicious killing of civilians. I would give them the bare minimum.\n\nAnd those foreigners who criticize us? Well, they got a hell of a nerve. The United States is carrying the load in the war on terrorism around the world with some help from our allies. But we are doing the heavy lifting and heavy spending. Those pinheads who sympathize with the captured terrorists really have another agenda, in my opinion. They simply hate America.\n\nTalking Points has said this before. Behind most overseas sniping at this country lies a mean streak of jealousy.\n\nAnd this terrorism business is mean. Thousands of lives are at stake, foreign terrorists do not deserve due process or constitutional rights. They should not be brutalized, but they should not be getting cozy either. The USA needs to send a message that terrorists will pay a huge price for their actions.\n\nMost Americans I know agree with me on this, but overseas, I don't expect much. The USA is simply too rich and powerful to engender much sympathy around the world. So we should ignore the critics and do what's best for America. We need protection from terrorists, and we need those who trespass against us to pay a major price.\n\nAnd that's the memo.\n\nThe Most Ridiculous Item of the Day\n\nTime now for \"The Most Ridiculous Item of the Day,\"\n\nThere's a new Harris poll out that asked Americans to name their favorite TV personalities. Number one was Drew Carey. Number two, Regis Philbin. Three, Oprah. Four, David Letterman. Five, Ray Romano. Six, Jay Leno. Seven, Bill O'Reilly.\n\nWait a minute! Hold it. What? Can you believe this? There's got to be a mistake. I actually beat out Kelsey Grammar, Katie Couric and Rosie O'Donnell. They rank eight, nine, and 10. I demand a recount. No way I should be on that list. It's ridiculous. Where's Buffy? Come on.\n\n\u2014 You can watch Bill O'Reilly's Talking Points and \"Most Ridiculous Item\" weeknights at 8 & 11p.m. ET on the Fox News Channel. Send your comments to: oreilly@foxnews.com",

      "Text": "    JERUSALEM, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Israel prepared to free some  230 Palestinian prisoners on Monday, nearly a week later than  planned, in a move it described as a goodwill gesture to  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.      The prisoners being freed are a fraction of the 11,000  Palestinians held by Israel. Their release was originally due to  take place last week, in the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha.      Israeli officials said Palestinians sought a delay for  logistical reasons. Abbas had been attending the haj pilgrimage  in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.      Palestinian officials denied requesting any postponement,  saying it stemmed from Israeli legal procedures.      The release was further delayed for several hours on Monday  as Israel's high court heard an appeal from Israeli rightists  who customarily object to freeing Palestinian prisoners.      But Yaron Zamir, a spokesman for Israel's prison services,  said 227 prisoners would  be freed around noon local time (1000  GMT).      Israel announced last month that it would free 250  prisoners, but the final list included only 227 names and it was  not immediately clear exactly how many would be freed.      Most of the prisoners would be sent to the Israeli-occupied  West Bank, where Abbas's government is based. Ten were expected  to go to the Gaza Strip, which Hamas Islamists seized in June  2007 after routing secular Fatah forces loyal to Abbas.      Aides to outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said  the prisoners came from the ranks of Fatah and other  non-Islamist groups.      Such releases are highly emotive for Palestinians, who  regard prisoners as symbols of resistance to Israeli occupation.      Israel freed nearly 200 prisoners in August.      U.S.-sponsored peace talks between Olmert and Abbas,  rejected by Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Gaza  Strip, have shown little sign of progress.

'We haven't heard of any political prisoners being freed,'  said Nyan Win, a spokesman for the opposition National League for  Democracy (NLD), whose leader, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi,  has been under house arrest for the last five years.      'I do hope they will be released, but I don't think it will  happen.'      Myanmar, or Burma as it used to be called, has more than  2,000 people behind bars on account of their political or  religious beliefs, human rights groups say.      The junta, which has ruled unchecked since 1962, denies the  existence of any political prisoners, saying all detainees have  committed crimes.      Official newspapers said the prisoners were being released  for the 'social consideration of their families' and to take part  in elections scheduled for 2010, part of a seven-step 'roadmap to  democracy'. Western governments dismiss the roadmap as a charade.

      "Text": "    CAPE TOWN, July 29 (Reuters) - A funding shortfall could  hurt HIV-positive South African prisoners in need of  antiretroviral drugs, a senior correctional services official  said on Tuesday.       Subashini Moodley, chief deputy commissioner in the  Department of Correctional Services told parliament the number  of prisoners requiring the anti-Aids medication was seen rising  to 4,800 by March.      This would force officials to increase funding to cater for  the prisoners' requirements.      'National Treasury has informed us that we will now have to  start paying for the ARV treatment... It's a budget that we  don't have,' Moodley said, adding the medication costs the  government 284 rand ($37.9) per offender each month.      South Africa has one of the world's highest rate of HIV, the  virus that causes Aids, with an estimated 500,000 people  infected each year.      About 1,000 people die every day from Aids-related diseases,  and this high mortality rate resonated in skyrocketing prison  deaths at the turn of the millennium.      Moodley said the department paid about 1.3 million rand to  provide 2718 prisoners with antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, but  this was expected to escalate to 10 million rand by the end of  March.      A recent study, partly funded by U.S President George W.  Bush's Presidential Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR),  showed a national HIV prevalence of 9.9 percent among prison  staff and 19.8 percent among prisoners.      According to South Africa's Judicial Inspectorate of Prisons  (JIP), the total number of prisoners who died declined to 1249  in 2007 from 1315 in 2006.      'The decline in the number of deaths is directly linked to  the distribution of ARVs among inmates and we welcome any  initiative to provide ill prisoners with adequate treatment, and  not only for Aids,' Gideon Morris, director at JIP told Reuters.      He said there was a strong correlation between overcrowded  prisons and prison mortality rates, with an estimated 165,000  (52,000 awaiting trial) incarcerated in prisons designed to hold  114,000 in total.

      "Text": "    By Stephanie Nebehay      GENEVA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The U.N's top human rights  official on Thursday applauded new U.S. President Barack Obama's  decision to close Guantanamo jail and urged him to look also at  prisoners' rights at U.S.-run centres in Afghanistan and Iraq.      U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay also  urged Obama to hold to account the perpetrators of torture or  unlawful methods of interrogation carried out in the U.S. 'war  on terror'.      'As High Commissioner and spokesperson for victims of  torture and incarceration all over the world, I welcome most  heartily this commitment by President Obama to close  Guantanamo,' Pillay told Reuters. 'I hope that it happens soon.'      A draft executive order obtained by Reuters in Washington on  Wednesday sets a one-year deadline to close the controversial  U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where foreign  terrorism suspects have been detained for years without trial.       The United States still holds about 250 men there and wants  to try about 80 of them on terrorism charges.            EUROPEAN RESPONSIBILITY      Pillay said European countries should take in some of the  Guantanamo detainees cleared for release who cannot return to  their homelands because of a risk they could be tortured or  persecuted there.      'Europe cooperated in the first instance in the rendition  and the unlawful removal of these persons from various  countries,' she said.      Guantanamo Bay prison was established at a U.S. naval base  in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States  and the launching of the 'war on terror' by the administration  of President George W. Bush.      Pillay said that she believed Obama would ensure that U.S.  federal law applied to the detainees and that any trials were  conducted in the ordinary courts rather than military  commissions which she said should be disbanded.       'I appeal to President Obama to also look into similar  detention regimes which have been set up or supported by the  U.S. government in Afghanistan and Iraq and ensure that those  detainees have judicial review of their detention and their  prospects of release or trial,' she said.      Obama will also ban abusive interrogations and order a  review of detention policies for captured militants, according  to congressional aides and a White House official. Military  commissions would be halted during the review.      'I think it is essential that the president sets up  structures to look into effective accountability for past  practices by perpetrators and interrogations and sets good  practices in place,' said Pillay, a former judge at the  International Criminal Court.      The United States has a strong judicial tradition of  protection of fundamental freedoms and prevention of torture and  unlawful methods of interrogation, she said.      'We always call for accountability of violations and this  would include individuals who controlled centres like Guantanamo  and Abu Ghraib and other centres,' Pillay said.      Revelations of prisoner abuse by U.S. military personnel at  Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad caused an international outcry in  2004.

      "Text": "    JERUSALEM, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Israel approved on Sunday the  release of 250 Palestinian prisoners in a bid to bolster  President Mahmoud Abbas in his power struggle with Hamas  Islamists who control the Gaza Strip.      The prisoners, a fraction of the 11,000 Palestinians held,  will be released in the occupied West Bank, where Abbas's  government holds sway, before next month's Muslim holiday of Eid  al-Adha, officials said of the decision, which was approved 13  to 5 by Israel's cabinet.      Outgoing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had promised to free the  prisoners earlier this month during a meeting with Abbas, who  launched peace talks with Israel a year ago after Gaza's violent  takeover by Hamas.      'This is a confidence-building measure,' said Olmert  spokesman Mark Regev.      He said Israel will release prisoners from the ranks of  Abbas's secular Fatah faction and other non-Islamist groups.       Israel has not said whether it would consider freeing high  profile Fatah inmates such as uprising leader Marwan Barghouthi,  who is seen as a possible successor to Abbas as Palestinian  president.      Nearly 200 prisoners were freed by Israel in August. Such  releases are highly emotive for Palestinians, who regard  prisoners as symbols of resistance to Israeli occupation.      U.S.-sponsored peace talks between Olmert and Abbas,  rejected by Hamas, have shown little sign of progress.

'We have called upon the Indian authorities to thoroughly  investigate the causes leading to the deaths of these unfortunate  Pakistani prisoners,' a foreign office spokesman said in a  statement.      Many Pakistanis were angered earlier this year when the  bodies of two other prisoners were returned, after Pakistan had  released a Indian man who had been sentence to hang for spying.      Relatives waited at the Wagha border on the outskirts of the  the eastern city of Lahore to receive the bodies of Rashida Bibi,  60, and Abdul Alim, a man in his mid-twenties,       Alim was arrested in 2001 while crossing into India, and   Bibi was taken into custody upon her arrival in India in 2006,  relatives told journalists.      They said they found no signs of physical abuse on the  bodies, but they would request autopsies.      The Pakistani spokesman hoped that the Pakistan-India  judicial committee on prisoners would take note of the matter  when it goes to meet Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails.      The nuclear-armed rivals began a peace process more than four  years ago, having gone to the brink of a fourth war in 2002.

      "Text": " (Adds prisoners freed, previous JERUSALEM, details, quotes)      By Ali Sawafta      RAMALLAH, West Bank, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Israel began freeing  224 Palestinian prisoners on Monday, nearly a week later than  planned, in a move it described as a goodwill gesture to  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.      'We hope these releases will be seen as an important       confidence-building measure designed to strengthen the trust and  the confidence in the (peace) negotiations,' said Mark Regev, a  spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.      Since last year, Regev said, Israel has released some 1,000  Palestinian prisoners. He did not say how many have been  arrested by Israel in that same time frame. Israel freed nearly  200 prisoners in August.      The prisoners freed on Monday are a fraction of the 11,000  Palestinians held by Israel. Their release was originally due to  take place last week, in the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha.      Israeli officials said Palestinians sought a delay for  logistical reasons. Abbas had been attending the haj pilgrimage  in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.      Palestinian officials denied requesting any postponement,  saying the delay was due to Israeli legal procedures.      The release was further delayed for several hours on Monday  as Israel's high court heard an appeal from right-wing Israelis  who customarily object to freeing Palestinian prisoners.      But the prisoners began being liberated at about noon local  time (1000 GMT), most of them at the Ofer Prison near the West  Bank town of Ramallah, said Yaron Zamir of Israel's prison  services. A smaller group was bused from a prison in the  southern Israeli town of Ashkelon to the Gaza Strip.      Most of the prisoners would be sent to the Israeli-occupied  West Bank, where Abbas's government is based.      Eighteen were expected to go to Gaza, which Hamas Islamists  seized in June 2007 after routing secular Fatah forces loyal to  Abbas.      Such releases are highly emotive for Palestinians, who  regard prisoners as symbols of resistance to Israeli occupation.      Aides to outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said  the prisoners came from the ranks of Fatah and other  non-Islamist groups.      U.S.-sponsored peace talks between Olmert and Abbas,  rejected by Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Gaza  Strip, have shown little sign of progress.

      "Text": "    KABUL, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. military has handed over  a group of 20 suspected Taliban fighters to Afghan custody under  a programme to transfer all Afghan prisoners from U.S.  detention, the Afghan Defence Ministry said on Sunday.      The prisoners were transferred from Bagram detention centre,  the hub of U.S.-led military operation to the north of Kabul,  and will be kept in Pul-i-Charkhi prison on the outskirts of the  capital, it said.      'These prisoners ... were actively involved in terrorist ...  operations against government forces and international troops,'  it said in a statement referring to the foreign forces stationed  in Afghanistan under the command of the U.S. military and NATO.      Saturday's transfer was the 15th round of its kind since  last year when the U.S. military agreed to hand over all  suspected Taliban prisoners after repeated Afghan government  requests.      Under the deal, all Afghan detainees kept at the U.S.  detention centre in Guantanamo Bay jail in Cuba, will be also  transferred to Afghan custody.      The ministry did not say how many Afghan prisoners have been  handed over so far and how many are still held in Guantanamo  Bay, Bagram and other U.S. detention centres in Afghanistan.      The U.S. military has arrested thousands of suspected  Taliban and al Qaeda militants since invading Afghanistan in  2001 and helping topple the Taliban government.      It has released several hundred detainees from Guantanamo  Bay and its facilities in Afghanistan since, but an unknown  nunmber are still held.      Taliban prisoners have staged at least two revolts in  Pul-i-Charkhi before it was refurbished and in the past have  complained of being badly treated. Several have managed to  escape.      Transferred inmates are set to be tried by a joint Afghan  commission. Those acquitted will be freed, according to Afghan  officials.      Human rights groups have criticised the U.S. government for  holding suspected Taliban and al Qaeda prisoners indefinitely  and without trial. Many former prisoners have complained of ill  treatment.   (Writing by Sayed Salahuddin, editing by Matthew Jones)   ((Kabul newsroom, tel: + 93 799 335 285))    Keywords: AFGHAN PRISONERS/       ",

      "Text": "    MOSCOW, June 2 (Reuters) - Four Russian prisoners died after  guards beat them following an attack on staff at a Urals prison,  the regional prosecutor's office said on Monday.      Authorities in the city of Chelyabinsk said the four men had  behaved aggressively when transported to the local prison to  serve out their sentences, calling on other prisoners to join  them in rising up against the guards in their bus.      'The convicts attacked administrative staff with  self-fashioned blades ... Five staff were injured to varying  degrees,' the  prosecutor's office said on its Internet site  www.chelproc.ru.      Guards used rubber truncheons and handcuffs to control the  prisoners and later isolated the men in separate cells.  Authorities said a medical worker looked in on the men, but  towards evening their health deteriorated and all four died.      The Chelyabinsk prosecutor's office said it had opened an  investigation into the deaths.

      "Text": "SANTA FE, N.M. -- Former astronaut Harrison Schmitt, who walked on the moon and once served New Mexico in the U.S. Senate, doesn't believe that humans are causing global warming.\n\n\"I don't think the human effect is significant compared to the natural effect,\" said Schmitt, who is among 70 skeptics scheduled to speak next month at the International Conference on Climate Change in New York.\n\nSchmitt contends that scientists \"are being intimidated\" if they disagree with the idea that burning fossil fuels has increased carbon dioxide levels, temperatures and sea levels.\n\n\"They've seen too many of their colleagues lose grant funding when they haven't gone along with the so-called political consensus that we're in a human-caused global warming,\" Schmitt said.\n\nDan Williams, publisher with the Chicago-based Heartland Institute, which is hosting the climate change conference, said he invited Schmitt after reading about his resignation from The Planetary Society, a nonprofit dedicated to space exploration.\n\nSchmitt resigned after the group blamed global warming on human activity. In his resignation letter, the 74-year-old geologist argued that the \"global warming scare is being used as a political tool to increase government control over American lives, incomes and decision making.\"\n\nWilliams said Heartland is skeptical about the crisis that people are proclaiming in global warming.\n\n\"Not that the planet hasn't warmed. We know it has or we'd all still be in the Ice Age,\" he said. \"But it has not reached a crisis proportion and, even among us skeptics, there's disagreement about how much man has been responsible for that warming.\"\n\nSchmitt said historical documents indicate average temperatures have risen by 1 degree per century since around 1400 A.D., and the rise in carbon dioxide is because of the temperature rise.\n\nSchmitt also said geological evidence indicates changes in sea level have been going on for thousands of years. He said smaller changes are related to changes in the elevation of land masses -- for example, the Great Lakes are rising because the earth's crust is rebounding from being depressed by glaciers.\n\nSchmitt, who grew up in Silver City and now lives in Albuquerque, has a science degree from the California Institute of Technology. He also studied geology at the University of Oslo in Norway and took a doctorate in geology from Harvard University in 1964.\n\nIn 1972, he was one of the last men to walk on the moon as part of the Apollo 17 mission.\n\nSchmitt said he's heartened that the upcoming conference is made up of scientists who haven't been manipulated by politics.\n\nOf the global warming debate, he said: \"It's one of the few times you've seen a sizable portion of scientists who ought to be objective take a political position and it's coloring their objectivity.\"",

      "Text": "    By Jim Loney      MIAMI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Rising ocean temperatures linked  to global warming could decrease the number of hurricanes  hitting the United States, according to new research released  on Wednesday.      The study, published in Geophysical Research Letters,  challenges recent research that suggests global warming could  be contributing to an increase in the frequency and the  intensity of Atlantic hurricanes.      At the same time, it reaffirmed earlier views that warmer  sea waters might result in atmospheric instabilities that could  prevent tropical storms from forming.      Atlantic storms play a pivotal role in the global energy,  insurance and commodities markets, particularly since the  devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons, which hammered  U.S. oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico.      The new study suggests that warmer seas, caused by  greenhouse gases blamed for a rise in global temperatures, are  linked to an increase in vertical wind shear, a difference in  wind speeds at different altitudes that can tear apart nascent  cyclones.      Hurricanes feed on warm water, leading to conventional  wisdom supported by some recent research that global warming  could be revving up more powerful storms.      But the new study, by oceanographer Chunzai Wang of the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Sang-Ki  Lee, a scientist at the University of Miami, examined 150 years  of hurricane records and found a small decline in hurricanes  making landfall in the United States as the oceans warmed.      'The attribution of the recent increase in Atlantic  hurricane activity to global warming is premature. ... Global  warming may decrease the likelihood of hurricanes making  landfall in the United States,' the researchers wrote.      Much of the recent research focused on the total number of  tropical storms and hurricanes recorded in the Atlantic Ocean  and Caribbean, but Wang said the number of those hurricanes  actually hitting the United States is a much better indicator.      Prior to the mid-1960s when satellites and other technology  made it easier to spot cyclones, some tropical storms and  hurricanes lived and died far out at sea, undetected.      As a result, scientists trying to track long-term trends in  the frequency of Atlantic storms work with uncertain data.      'We believe U.S. landings for hurricanes are most reliable  measurements over the long term,' Wang said.      The study found that warming of the tropical Pacific and  Indian oceans increases Atlantic wind shear while rising sea  temperatures in the tropical North Atlantic decrease shear.      The two effects compete, but the net impact is an increase  in wind shear in the main Atlantic hurricane development zone,  from the west coast of Africa to Central America.      'The Pacific and Indian warming wins and the result is a  decrease in landfalling U.S. hurricanes,' Wang said.      In 2004, four strong hurricanes hit Florida, causing  billions of dollars in damage across the state. In 2005, a  record-breaking 28 tropical storms formed, including Katrina,  which killed 1,500 people and caused $80 billion damage.      The back-to-back years of unusually intense hurricane  activity fueled debate about the impact of global warming.

      "Text": "This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity & Colmes,\" November 10, 2008. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nALAN COLMES, CO-HOST: Greenpeace calls him a climate criminal, but some think Chris Horner is the only one uncovering the truth about global warming. His new book, \"Red Hot Lies: How Global Warming Alarmist Use Threats, Fraud and Deception to Keep You Misinformed.\" That's what it's called. Horner warns of the alarmist green agenda, which he claims may reach new heights under the new administration.\n\nJoining us the author, Chris Horner.\n\nI guess we've got to be really scared, as Dick Morris said, about Obama, radical lefty. We're going to scare people about the incoming president, right, Chris?\n\nCHRIS HORNER, AUTHOR, \"RED HOT LIES\": Well, it depends on what frightens you, Alan, and I know this agenda doesn't frighten you; it affirms your world view.\n\n\u2022 Video: Watch Sean and Alan's interview with Chris Horner\n\nBut there are some things that are now quite obviously on tap, and they are because \u2014 there remains public opposition. For example, President-elect Obama has indicated he wants to reclassify the Kyoto Protocol, which has been stalled in the Senate for 10 years. We signed it \u2014 we signed it 10 years ago Wednesday, even though you guys can't get that right.\n\nAnd he wants to reclassify it as an executive agreement. He wants to reclassify it as an executive agreement, requiring a simple up or down no amendment, no filibuster vote, in order to get around opposition and a little something called the Constitution. So if that doesn't alarm you, then no, you should feel just fine.\n\nCOLMES: Well, I'm not alarmed (ph). But some of the things you say in the book are very interesting to me. For example, you say children are being corrupted by those who want to focus on global warming, and you cite a study that children in England, where they had to watch Al Gore's movie, stay up nights, worried about global warming and climate change.\n\nI thought you conservative thought Gore put people to sleep. I thought it was the other way around.\n\nSEAN HANNITY, CO-HOST: He puts me to sleep.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHORNER: As a father of young children, I don't think it's funny anymore. More than half of the UK school children polled reported that they lost sleep at night, terrified over catastrophic manmade global warming that's being indoctrinated into their heads by the schools. We have something efforts underway here in California, and it includes what they call pester power and also reporting on their parents.\n\nNow, I thought you believed in separation of church and state. This clearly violates that.\n\nCOLMES: I don't know how they violate. Well, first of all, you're talking about England, a study of 1,100 people, of 7 to 11. And most of them blamed either politicians; 1 in 7 blame their parents.\n\nYou also say China wants carbon offsets for children, not born because of their restrictive family issues. I found that \u2014 policies. I found that a fascinating part of your book.\n\nHORNER: Yes, here's what happened. About 18 months ago, at a Kyoto negotiation in Thailand, China suggested that, because of their family planning policy, that they should be given carbon offsets to sell back to Europe and, ultimately, the United States, on the basis that their population would be much larger if they would have all these babies that they aborted. And therefore, they would have a much larger carbon footprint. And we should pay them for these offsets.\n\nHANNITY: That's great.\n\nHORNER: That's reprehensible. And the European leaders (ph) thought it was great, and the U.N. thought it was great.\n\nHANNITY: And where's some of the biggest polluters? Right? Which countries? Right, Chris? It's almost...\n\nHORNER: Well, if you believe that carbon dioxide is a pollutant, then China would be the world's greatest polluter. But plants might disagree with you.\n\nHANNITY: Let me ask you this, Chris. One of the reasons we're so energy dependant is because of the global warming hysteria and extremism. You agree with that? I know you agree with that statement. I've interviewed you in the past.\n\nHORNER: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: Look, for example, you know, the auto industry. You know, they've got safety mandates. They've got CAFE standards that we've discussed at length here. Bad trade policy. And that has put them in a very difficult position where they can't even compete. Meanwhile, foreign countries can compete here in this country. You know, now they're struggling because of the government policies.\n\nThis is going to be worse if this more extreme agenda that Obama seems to be leaning towards gets implemented. Right or wrong?\n\nHORNER: Yes. You're right, and in fact, Al Gore laid this out for you in an op-ed in the New York Times yesterday, in which he called for, essentially, a series of bailouts for other great new ideas, that this longtime champion of the ethanol boondoggle has.\n\nAnd close students of the game, Sean, probably recognize these as industries in which he has invested. And, by the way, since Alan's always obsessed with funding, $300 million has been given him in the last three years to rebrand global warming to climate crisis. And he doesn't tell us where it came from. And I'm curious that you're not curious where that money came from, Alan.\n\nHANNITY: By the way, and I've got Al Gore on his private jet. Let me ask you this. You've had intimidation efforts. Scientists that debunk global warming, they've been intimidated. How widespread is this? And tell us about your story, real quick, in the time we have left.\n\nHORNER: OK. It's very widespread. I was in a meeting in Vienna of a bunch of scientists, and I happened to relate about how Greenpeace was stealing my trash and the trash of a White House aide that I just happened to learn about.\n\nAnd these scientists began telling me their own tales. One scientist at the University of Oslo had the wheels fall off his car, not once, but twice, including while his daughter was in the car after he began speaking out against global warming alarmism. They started sending pizza to his house. That didn't intimidate him. So they loosened the lug nuts on his car.\n\nTim Ball's (ph) gotten death threats. There are professional threats.\n\nHANNITY: We've got to go.\n\nHORNER: There are (UNINTELLIGIBLE), and people are being chased out of their profession.\n\nHANNITY: All right. Thanks, Chris. Appreciate you being with us. Good luck with the book.\n\nWatch \"Hannity & Colmes\" weeknights at 9 p.m. ET!\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2008 FOX News Network, Inc. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

      "Text": "    By Sam Cage      DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The Himalayas are  suffering the effects of global warming more acutely because of  their height and melting glaciers could flood local settlements,  the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said on Thursday.      'The Himalaya, that's really moving very fast. They're being  hit very hard,' IUCN Director General Julia Marton-Lefevre told  Reuters at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.      Thousands of glaciers in the Himalaya mountains are the  source of water for nine major Asian rivers whose basins are  home to 1.3 billion people, including Pakistan and parts of  India and China.      The melting causes lakes to form at the base of glaciers,  which may then break their banks and flood down the valleys.      'When the glaciers recede there's a growing danger of  glacial dams collapsing,' Marton-Lefevre said. 'The effect will  be very dramatic.'      'There's a lot of poor people living at the foot of the  Himalaya,' she said.      Marton-Lefevre said it could take decades to slow down the  process of global warming, but hoped it would be possible.      There is now a greater commitment from businesses and  governments to cutting emissions, as scientific studies, extreme  weather and climate campaigning have all raised awareness of the  problem.    About 190 nations agreed in December in Bali, Indonesia, to  launch negotiations on a new pact to fight global warming.      'I'm concerned about how difficult this road map is going to  be, and then there are some recalcitrant countries, like the  United States,' Marton-Lefevre said.

      "Text": "    By Andrew Stern      CHICAGO, May 28 (Reuters) - Global warming will likely  drain more water from the Great Lakes and pose added pollution  threats to the region's vulnerable ecosystem, environmental  groups said in a report issued on Wednesday.      Climate change could further reduce scant ice cover  observed in recent winters, increasing evaporation rates and  dropping water levels in the five lakes that collectively make  up 20 percent of the world's surface fresh water.      Last year, Lake Superior water levels receded to their  lowest in 77 years before rebounding, and the report by the  Healing Our Waters-Great Lakes Coalition predicted global  warming could lower lake levels by up to 3 feet (1 meter) over  the next century.      The lower levels will hamper lake shipping, expose polluted  sediments, and further damage water quality.      'Climate change is threatening the health of the Great  Lakes and jeopardizing efforts to restore them,' the  coalition's Jeff Skelding said in a teleconference.      The coalition represents groups including zoos, fishing and  hunting interests, business organizations and environmental  groups.      The report said global warming added to the urgent need for  the U.S. Congress to act on more pieces of a $20 billion Great  Lakes restoration plan, proposed back in 2005.      Spending priorities are billions of dollars needed to  repair antiquated sewage treatment plants as well as cleaning  up toxic sediments from past pollution, restoring coastal  wetlands that naturally cleanse pollutants and stopping  invasive species of fish, plants and mussels, the report said.      Scientists studying climate change have predicted more  frequent droughts that will hurt the lakes' coastal ecosystem  coupled with more intense storms that produce runoff containing  toxic metals, viruses and other pollutants, the report said.           THIRSTY WORLD      The report blamed warming temperatures for ruining ice  fishing in many areas, shortening the snowmobile season and  harming Michigan's tart cherry crop. Warming could expand or  create new oxygen-depleted 'dead zones' in the lakes caused in  part by uncontrolled algae growth and other processes.      'If Congress delays in acting to curb global warming and to  restore the lakes, the problems will only get worse and the  solutions more costly,' Skelding said.      Perhaps the most promising avenue for new funding is  contained in a proposal in Congress that calls for auctioning  off permits to emit greenhouse gases in a so-called  cap-and-trade system. Proceeds from the auctions could provide  a stream of up to $3 billion a year for ecological restoration,  said Andy Buchsbaum of the National Wildlife Federation.      Meanwhile, eight U.S. states and two Canadian provinces  bordering the lakes should enact a compact to prevent  diversions of lake water to an 'increasingly thirsty world,'  Buchsbaum said. All but three states have passed the compact,  after which the federal governments of both countries would be  asked to ratify it.

      "Text": "    By Michael Kahn      LONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - Natural climate changes may  offset human-caused global warming over the next decade, keeping  ocean temperatures the same or even temporarily cooling them  slightly, German researchers said on Wednesday.      However, this short-term situation might create a problem if  policymakers regarded it as a sign they could ease efforts to  limit greenhouse gases or play down global warming.      'The natural variations change climate on this timescale and  policymakers may either think mitigation is working or that  there is no global warming at all,' said Noel Keenlyside, a  climate researcher at the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences  in Germany who led the study.      Climate researchers have long predicted more greenhouse  gases in the atmosphere would spur a general warming trend over  the next 100 years. The study in the journal Nature is one of  the first to take a shorter-term view.      This is useful because natural changes as opposed to human  causes may play a bigger role in the short term, Keenlyside  said.      His team made a computer model that takes into account  natural phenomena such as sea surface temperatures and ocean  circulation patterns.      They checked their work by producing a set of forecasts  using data recorded over the past 50 years and found the  retrospective forecasts were accurate, Keenlyside said.      'This is important because policies are made in the short  term,' Keenlyside said. 'Our results show we might not have as  much change in climate over the next 10 years.'      A United Nations climate panel report this year predicted  temperatures would rise between 1.8 and 4 degrees Celsius this  century, in part because of fossil fuels that produce carbon  dioxide, the main greenhouse gas.      Scientists say rising temperatures could cause seas to rise  sharply, glaciers to melt and storms and droughts to become more  intense. These in turn may force mass migrations of climate  refugees.      One possible reason for the relative cooling effect in the  next decade is the predicted weakening of a system that brings  warm water northward into the North Atlantic and offsets an  expected rise in greenhouse gases, Keenlyside said.      'The first attempts at decadal prediction suggest that  reasonably accurate forecasts of the combined effects of  increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations and natural climate  variations can be made,' Richard Wood of Britain's Met Office,  who was not involved in the study, wrote in a Nature commentary.

      "Text": "    By Tom Brown      MIAMI, April 5 (Reuters) - The Nobel Prize-winning  scientist who rang the first alarm bells over the ozone hole  issued a warming about climate change on Saturday, saying there  could be 'almost irreversible consequences' if the Earth warmed  2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees F) above what it ought to be.      'Things are changing and there's no doubt that it's as a  result of human activities,' said Mario Molina, a Mexican who  shared a Nobel prize in chemistry in 1995 for groundbreaking  work on chlorofluorocarbon gases and their threat to the  Earth's ozone layer.      'Long before we run out of oil, we will run out of  atmosphere,' he said.      Molina told a panel discussion on climate change at an  annual Inter-American Development Bank meeting in Miami that  the increasing intensity of hurricanes was among the worrisome  changes that scientists had linked to a rapid global warming  trend over the past 30 years.      Molina did not elaborate on specific effects so far from  the Earth's temperature rise, which has been slightly less than  1 degree Celsius (1.8 F) over the last century.      But he said certain 'tipping points' would be reached if  temperatures continue increasing, including unmanageable  changes to the Earth's environment.      Molina later told Reuters there was considerable  uncertainty about how much further warming the planet can  sustain before it reaches critical levels.      'You keep changing the temperature gradually but then  suddenly things change dramatically,' he said.      'Trying to keep it (warming) below two degrees (Celsius)  means we want to keep the change at most twice or three times  what it has changed already. And that's because it's  unrealistic to change it by less, because of what we have  already done,' Molina said.      'The idea to keep the temperature change not above 2.5  (degrees Celsius) is precisely to reduce the possibility of  these tipping points happening,' he added.      He said warming beyond that would pose 'a risk that is not  acceptable to society.'

      "Text": "    By Sylvia Westall      VIENNA, April 17 (Reuters) - Wild fires are likely to be  bigger, more frequent and burn for longer as the world gets  hotter, in turn speeding up global warming to create a dangerous  vicious circle, scientists say.      The process is being studied as part of work to develop a  detailed map of global fire patterns which will be used with  climate models to predict future fire trends.      The scientists told a geoscience conference in Vienna they  already predict fires will increase and could spread to  previously fire-free parts of the world as the climate changes.      'An increase in fire may be the greatest early impact of  climate change on forests,' Brian Amiro from the University of  Manitoba said late on Wednesday.      'Our forests are more likely to become a victim of climate  change than a saviour,' he added.      Last year more than 200 wild fires swept across parts of  southeastern Europe, destroying homes and devouring woodland. In  Greece 65 people died.      Amiro said global warming will cause more fires which as  they burn contribute to global warming by producing greenhouse  gases.      'Fire avoids environmental extremes, like the deserts,  tundra and rainforests,' said Max Moritz from the University of  California, Berkley.      'But there are some predictions which show there could be  fires in deserts and there are worries they may occur in  tropical rainforests if they were drier,' he said.      Forests are natural carbon stores, some built up over  millions of years, but as they burn they release the carbon  quickly in the form of carbon dioxide.      Scientists already estimate that Canadian wild fires will  double in area by the end of the century and that the fire  season will be longer.      -- For Reuters latest environment blogs click on:   http://blogs.reuters.com/environment/    (Editing by Matthew Jones)    ((sylvia.westall@reuters.com; Vienna Newsroom, +43 153 112  258; Reuters Messaging: sylvia.westall.reuters.com@reuters.net))    Keywords: ENVIRONMENT FIRES       ",

The UBS Greenhouse Index will lock into contracts on the  Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the European Climate Exchange and  on the Nordic exchange Nord Pool.

The index will have a governing committee that will meet  each year to decide the composition and weighting of the new  index and its three related sub-indices.      In April 2007, UBS launched its Global Warming Index to  offer a tradable benchmark in the weather derivative market, one  of many indexes launched by banks in response to 2012 emissions  targets set by the Kyoto Protocol for fighting climate change.

      "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Global warming threatens the  future and the incoming Obama administration will take steps to  address the problem, Steven Chu, President-elect Barack Obama's  pick to be U.S. energy secretary, told lawmakers on Tuesday.      'Climate change is a growing and pressing problem. It is  now clear that if we continue on our current path, we run the  risk of dramatic, disruptive changes to our climate in the  lifetimes of our children and grandchildren,' Chu said at his  confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural  Resources Committee.      Chu said the Obama administration will seek to impose a  cap-and-trade system to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Under  such a system, power plants, oil refineries and other  industrial facilities would have to buy and sell pollution  permits to spew global warming emissions.      Sen. Jeff Bingaman, who heads the Senate panel, said he  hopes the committee will approve Chu's nomination later this  week and then the full Senate will confirm him next Tuesday.

      "Text": "    By Peter Murphy      SAO PAULO, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Higher temperatures caused by  global warming will reduce land available in Brazil to plant  its most important crops and push its coffee production back  toward the more frost-prone south, a study showed on Monday.      By 2020, the total area suitable for planting soy, the  country's most valuable agricultural export, could fall by  one-quarter, while land suited to coffee production could fall  by nearly 10 percent, the study said.      The research was conducted by the Centre for Meteorological  and Climatic Research Applied to Agricultural of the University  of Campinas in Sao Paulo state, in partnership with federal  agricultural research institute, Embrapa.      'Global warming could bring about a significant change to  Brazil's agricultural map, causing a reduction in productive  areas and revenue losses of around 7.4 billion reais ($4.6  billion) in 2020,' a summary of the research said.      The calculations, based on two scenarios of temperature --  a rise of between 2 and 5.4 degrees Celsius, or a rise of  between 1.4 and 3.8 degrees C -- referred to the amount of land  suitable for production of the crops, and not the land actually  planted with them at present.      The study said soy production in the Latin American country  could suffer 4 billion reais in losses in 2020, nearly  one-quarter of the total value of the crop produced in 2006 and  land suited to the crop could fall by 40 percent by 2070.      It said coffee production in the world's top grower may  have to shift from its southeastern heartland to more southern  regions, such as Parana state, which coffee farmers abandoned  after a severe frost devastated the crop in the mid-1970s.      'With the forecast climate changes, it's possible that  coffee will not have much chance of surviving in the southeast  and migrate to the southern region,' the summary said.      The total area suited to production of rice and corn could  fall by 10 and 12 percent, respectively, according to the  study.      One winner from global warming, albeit until climate change  would worsen decades later, would be sugar cane. The study said  its ability to survive prolonged dry conditions meant it could   be grown in areas that would no longer be able to support other  crops.      The total cane-planted area has been rising in recent  years, driven by demand for cane-derived ethanol to power  Brazil's fast-growing fleet of 'flex-fuel' cars, which can run  solely on the biofuel or any mixture of it with regular  gasoline.      The study said cane production would become increasingly  dependent on irrigation during the dry season as climate change  bites.      'This (warming) has a 95 percent chance of taking place,'  Hilton Silveira Pinto, coordinator of the study, told Reuters.      'Brazil needs to prepare, and quickly,' he added.

They make movies and star in public service announcements - all in the name of saving the planet. But their private lives, well that tells a very different story.\n\n\u2022 Click here to watch this segment\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n(voice over): In Hollywood, saving the planet is the ultimate cause celebre. Dozens of high-profile actors and musicians have made it their mission to repeat the hysterics of \"climate expert\" Al Gore and tell the rest of us how we should live.\n\nBut just like the vanquished vice president, \"green\" celebrities don't always practice the way they preach. Now, here's a list of some of Hollywood's worst global-warming hypocrites:\n\nLEONARDO DICAPRIO, ACTOR: Global warming that has taken much of our attention as it should.\n\nHANNITY: First up, there's the actor Leonardo \"The Lear Jet Liberal\" DiCaprio. Now, he's done his absolute best to frighten people about the horrors of global warming. His documentary, \"The 11th Hour,\" utilized Hollywood scare tactics to urge people to change their wasteful ways before it's too late.\n\nDiCaprio says he does his part by driving a hybrid, using solar energy, and \"trying as often as possible\" to \"fly commercially.\" But so far, he won't pledge to completely give up the convenience and the glamour of those private jets.\n\nAnd then there's Babs \u2014 that's Barbara Streisand. Now, he posted on her extremely accurate and perfectly spelled Web site, an article called, \"Simple Things We Can All Do To Help Stop Global Warming.\" And that list includes suggestions like turning off the lights, eating organic and buying recycled.\n\n(BARBARA STREISAND SINGING \"MEMORIES\")\n\nNow let's see how her tour demands stack up in the fight against global warming. The contract rider on Streisand's recent European tour specified that the singer needed thirteen 53-foot semi-tractor trailers, four rental vans, 14 crew and van buses and one limousine, of course, that was for her, the star. The green goddess also needed 120 bath sized towels and only peach colored bathroom tissue and rose petals in the toilet. Need I say more?\n\nAnd let's not forget Madonna. Well, she graced the cover of Vanity Fair's \"Green Issue\" this year, but she may have been miscast. It's been reported that her \"Ray of Light\" foundation has invested at least $2.7 million in environmentally unfriendly companies like Alcoa, the Ford Motor Company and other businesses criticized by all the global warming alarmists.\n\nAnd Madonna's carbon footprint \u2014 well, that's no better. In 2006, it is estimated that the Material Girl's private jet usage racked up about 100 times more carbon dioxide than the average person. And it doesn't include her fleet of cars. Mama, please don't preach.\n\nNext up is the jet setting couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Now, Brad has been quoted as saying \"There are a lot of problems in the world right now because of our dependency on oil.\" But it looks like he and Angelina \u2014 well, they're more dependent than most. According to The Daily Mail, in 2007 alone, \"Brangelina\" literally crisscrossed the globe in private jets dozens of times. Now, is that really necessary?\n\nAnd then finally, there's actor John Travolta. Now he's the owner of no less than five, that's right \u2014 five private jets and still has the nerve to ask his fans to do their part to save the environment. At the red carpet event to promote his blockbuster movie, \"Wild Hogs,\" Travolta said we should all do our part because \"global warming is a very valid issue.\"\n\n(CLIP FROM \"WILD HOGS\" FEATURING JOHN TRAVOLTA, ACTOR:) Whoo! It's my prerogative.\n\nHANNITY: There you have it. Looks like in Hollywood, global warming activism is just a load of hype, and the celebrities are quick to tell everyone else how to live. You know what? They are nothing more than a bunch of hot air hypocrites.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)",

In a 'Tokyo Declaration' issued on Friday by the dozen  companies partnering with conservation group WWF for emission  reductions, they said they will expand the scope of their  activities by involving their business partners and customers.      At electronics and entertainment conglomerate Sony, for  example, one potential step would be working with transportation  companies that handle the distribution of its products to help  cut their emissions, a Sony official said.       Sony Chief Executive Howard Stringer said that despite the  problems and crises that political and business leaders face  today, they need to start acting immediately on the issue of  global warming to avert the crisis of tomorrow.       'I went to Davos last month, originally expecting climate  change will be the main focus of the World Economic Forum,'  Stringer told a news conference. 'Instead, participants,  unsurprisingly, were more preoccupied with the global financial  meltdown than the meltdown of icebergs and glaciers.'      Besides Sony and No.1 cellphone supplier Nokia, companies  that signed the declaration include top PC maker Hewlett-Packard  Co <HPQ.N>, athletic shoes and clothing maker Nike Inc <NKE.N>  and Novo Nordisk <NOVOb.CO>, the world's biggest maker of  insulin.

      "Text": "    LONDON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - A European Union target to limit  warming of the planet to no more than 2 degrees Celsius may not  be technically achievable, the International Energy Agency said  in a report to be published next week.      'Even leaving aside any debate about the political  feasibility ... it is uncertain whether the scale of the  transformation envisaged is even technically achievable, as the  scenario assumes broad development of technologies that have not  yet been proven,' said the IEA's World Energy Outlook.      That analysis referred to a target to limit global warming  to no more than 2 degrees.      The implication is that the world may have to accept higher  warming limits than targeted at present, for example by the EU  since 1996, and prepare for effects which scientists say will  include more droughts, floods and rising seas.      A United Nations climate panel said last year that above 3  degrees 'hundreds of millions of people (would be) exposed to  increased water stress (shortages).'      Stronger action to fight climate change involves rapidly  escalating costs, for example to deploy expensive, untested  technologies such as carbon scrubbers and even to leave stranded  assets -- where high-carbon coal plants, for example, have to be  closed prematurely.      'It will be necessary to face up to the reality of the cost  of early capital retirement if radical measures are to be taken  ... to deliver deep cuts in emissions,' the IEA said in its  report, due to be published on Nov. 12. The IEA is energy  adviser to 28 industrialised countries.      The IEA analysed two scenarios to limit warming to 2 degrees  and 3 degrees, and estimated that these would cost about $180  and $90 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions respectively.      The present EU carbon price is about 18 euros ($23.20), and  accounts for about one fifth of European consumer electricity  prices, say analysts.      'The scale of the challenge ... is immense,' the IEA said of  a 2 degrees target. 'The technology shift, if achievable, would  certainly be unprecedented in scale and speed of deployment.'      The EU Council of Ministers stated in 1996 that it 'believes  that global average temperatures should not exceed 2 degrees  above pre-industrial level.'

      "Text": "    April 17 (Reuters) - Paris is hosting a meeting of 17 top  national emitters of greenhouse gases in a U.S.-backed scheme to  fight global warming and guarantee energy security while  promoting economic growth.      Here are some frequent questions about the 'Major Economies  Meeting':            WHOSE IDEA IS IT?      U.S. President George W. Bush, long criticised by his allies  for doing too little to combat climate change, announced in May  2007 that he planned a series of climate meetings among major  emitters before he steps down in January 2009. Pressure for  action also came from the U.N. Climate Panel, which said in  February 2007 that it was at least 90 percent sure that human  activities, led by burning fossil fuels, were stoking warming.            WHICH ARE THE MAJOR ECONOMIES?      Countries taking part are the United States, France,  Germany, Italy, Britain, Japan, China, Canada, India, Brazil,  South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Australia, Indonesia and South  Africa. The European Commission, current European Union  president Slovenia and the United Nations will also attend. The  major economies account for 80 percent of world greenhouse gas  emissions, topped by the United States and China.            WHAT DOES BUSH WANT THEM TO DO?      Under Bush's plan, the countries will 'by the end of 2008,  agree on a post-2012 framework that could include a long-term  global goal, nationally defined mid-term goals and strategies  and sector-based approaches for improving energy security and  reducing greenhouse gas emissions'.            WHAT HAVE MEETINGS ACHIEVED SO FAR?      Not much. A first round of talks was held in Washington in  September and a second in Hawaii in January. Delegates include  environment ministers, their deputies or senior officials.            DOES IT LINK TO U.N. CLIMATE TALKS?      Bush says that the U.S.-led meetings will contribute to a  U.N. plan to work out, by the end of 2009, a new treaty to  succeed the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol.      Kyoto binds 37 rich nations to cut emissions by at least 5  percent below 1990 levels by 2008-12 -- the United States is  isolated among its allies in opposing Kyoto, arguing that it  would cost too much and wrongly omits 2012 targets for  developing nations. Some of Bush's allies worry that Bush's plan  is a distraction from the U.N. track.

      "Text": "    By David Ljunggren      OTTAWA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The incredibly rapid rate at  which Canada's Arctic ice shelves are disappearing is an early  indicator of the 'very substantial changes' that global warming  will impose on all mankind, a top scientist said on Wednesday.      Researchers announced late on Tuesday that the five ice  shelves along Ellesmere Island in the Far North, which are more  than 4,000 years old, had shrunk by 23 percent this summer  alone.      The largest shelf is disintegrating and one of the smaller  shelves, covering 19 square miles (55 square km), broke away  entirely last month.      'Climate models indicate that the greatest changes, the  most severe changes, will happen earliest in the highest  northern latitudes,' said Warwick Vincent, director of the  Centre for Northern Studies at Laval University in Quebec.      'This will be the starting point for more substantial  changes throughout the rest of the planet.... Our indicators  are showing us exactly what the climate models predict,' he  told Reuters in an interview.      Global warming is forecast to generate more damaging  weather extremes such as hurricanes, cyclones and floods.      Vincent, who has visited the ice shelves along Ellesmere  Island every year for the past 10 years, said the impact of  higher temperatures this year was 'staggering'.      His team had estimated that the shelves would lose eight  square miles this summer. The true figure was 83 square miles.      'What was extraordinary was just the vast quantity of open  water ... you could see open water to the horizon in an area  that is typically ice-covered throughout the season,' he said.      The Markham Ice Shelf split away from Ellesmere Island in  early August. Two large chunks totaling 47 square miles have  broken off the nearby Serson Ice Shelf, reducing it in size by  60 percent.      The Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, at 155 square miles the largest of  the remaining four shelves, is disintegrating.      'Clearly the long-term viability of that ice shelf is now  actually short-term,' said Vincent.      The peak temperature the team recorded was 67.5 degrees  Fahrenheit (19.7 degrees Celsius), far above the average of 46  degrees Fahrenheit.      Vincent said he had no doubt that global warming was caused  in part by human activity.      'I think we're at a point where it is not stoppable but it  can be slowed down. And if you think about the magnitude of  effects on our society, then we really need to buy ourselves  more time to get ready for some very substantial changes that  are ahead,' he said.      Ellesmere Island was once home to a single enormous ice  shelf totaling around 3,500 square miles. All that is left  today are the four much smaller shelves that together cover  little more than 300 square miles.      Scientists say the shelves, which contain unique  microscopic ecosystems that have not yet been studied, will not  be replaced because they took so long to form.      'More and more, we're realizing that it is microscopic life  that really dominates the biodiversity of planet Earth ... we  really need to understand what that biodiversity is,' said  Vincent.

      "Text": "    By Julie Steenhuysen      CHICAGO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The climate is heating up far  faster than scientists had predicted, spurred by sharp  increases in greenhouse gas emissions from developing countries  like China and India, a top climate scientist said on  Saturday.      'The consequence of that is we are basically looking now at  a future climate that is beyond anything that we've considered  seriously,' Chris Field, a member of the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, told the American Association  for the Advancement of Science meeting in Chicago.      Field said 'the actual trajectory of climate change is more  serious' than any of the climate predictions in the IPCC's  fourth assessment report called 'Climate Change 2007.'      He said recent climate studies suggested the continued  warming of the planet from greenhouse gas emissions could touch  off large, destructive wildfires in tropical rain forests and  melt permafrost in the Arctic tundra, releasing billions of  tons of greenhouse gasses that could raise global temperatures  even more.      'There is a real risk that human-caused climate change will  accelerate the release of carbon dioxide from forest and tundra  ecosystems, which have been storing a lot of carbon for  thousands of years,' Field, of Stanford University and the  Carnegie Institution for Science, said in a statement.      He pointed to recent studies showing the fourth assessment  report underestimated the potential severity of global warming  over the next 100 years.      'We now have data showing that from 2000 to 2007,  greenhouse gas emissions increased far more rapidly than we  expected, primarily because developing countries, like China  and India, saw a huge surge in electric power generation,  almost all of it based on coal,' Field said.      He said that trend was likely to continue if more countries  turned to coal and other carbon-intensive fuels to meet their  energy needs. If so, he said the impact of climate change would  be 'more serious and diverse' than the IPCC's most recent  predictions.

      "Text": "    By Deborah Zabarenko, Environment Correspondent      WASHINGTON, July 1 (Reuters) - Floods like those that  inundated the U.S. Midwest are supposed to occur once every 500  years but this is the second since 1993, suggesting flawed  forecasts that do not take global warming into account,  conservation experts said on Tuesday.      'Although no single weather event can be attributed to global  warming, it's critical to understand that a warming climate is  supplying the very conditions that fuel these kinds of weather  events,' said Amanda Staudt, a climate scientist with the National  Wildlife Federation.      Warmer air can carry more water, Staudt said in a telephone  briefing, and this means more heavy precipitation in the central  United States. Big Midwestern storms that used to be seen every 20  years or so will likely occur every four to six years by century's  end, she said.      The idea that certain places along the Mississippi River and  its tributaries will only flood once every 500 years may be based  on mistaken assumptions that flood patterns do not change over  time, said Nicholas Pinter of Southern Illinois University.      Pinter said these assumptions are contained in an analysis on  Mississippi River flooding in the upper Midwest, led by the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers, which among other things builds and  maintains river levees.      In the last 35 years, there have been four floods in the  Mississippi River basin that qualified as 100-year floods or  higher according to the Army Corps' analysis, Pinter said.           BIGGER, MORE FREQUENT FLOODS      'It is an impossibility that those numbers can be correct,'  Pinter told reporters. 'These are not random events. We're getting  a systemmatic pattern of floods larger and/or more frequent than  currently estimated by those calculations.'      The Army Corps' analysis rejects any kind of climate change --  human-generated or naturally occurring -- as a mechanism that  could alter flood patterns along the Mississippi over the last  century, Pinter said.      He said the analysis also rejects the effects of land use and  navigation construction over that period.      'We suggest the current flood, sadly, is a confirmation that  ... these numbers are probably invalid, underestimating the  occurrence of floods up and down this river for a variety of  mechanisms,' Pinter said.      Given the impact of this year's Midwest floods, the National  Wildlife Federation, a non-profit conservation group, called on  Congress to hold immediate hearings to revise the National Flood  Insurance Reform and Modernization Act.      In a letter to chairmen and ranking members of the Senate  Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee,  federation president Larry Schweiger noted that there was  significant rebuilding in flood plains along the Mississippi after  the 1993 floods.      'While there may have been an expectation that such floods  would only happen every 500 years, scientists now warn that  climate change will make such floods far more frequent,' Schweiger  wrote.

From children's books to school plays, the climate change crowd is dreaming of a green Christmas, angering opponents who say 'tis NOT the season to be preachy.\n\nThe children's book \"Santa Goes Green\" by Anne Margaret Lewis tells how a young boy named Finn gets Santa to leave the North Pole to help him track down Leopold, a polar bear he has adopted, because the sea ice is melting and Leopold's home is in danger.\n\n\u201cYou see, it\u2019s like this Santa,\u201d Finn tells Santa in the book. \u201cI\u2019ve adopted a polar bear named Leopold. He is in danger of losing his home. I\u2019m sure you being in the North Pole you know about the melting glaciers. All I want this year Santa, is to save Leopold and his home.\u201d\n\nSanta is so inspired by his visit to the polar bear that he decides to re-use last year's wrapping paper, recycle toys and start using wind to generate power for his toy shop.\n\nThe book ends with a note from Santa urging kids to send him notes on how to take care of the planet.\n\nBut the content has left some reviewers feeling bearish about the book. \"The global climate change alarmists are now trying brainwash our kids by infusing their unproven and baseless climate change rhetoric into Santa books,\" T. Wilkinson wrote on Amazon.com, giving \"Santa Goes Green\" a one-star review.\n\n\"Sad. Really sad,\" Wilkinson wrote.\n\nLewis, the author, told USA Today she was inspired to write the book after reading an article with her son Cameron about melting glaciers destroying polar bear habitats.\n\n\"He asked how we could help the polar bears, so we started going around the house every time we left a room and shut the lights off,\" Lewis told the newspaper. \"Then we would say, 'We just saved another polar bear.\"\n\nAnother environmentalist Christmas tome that hit store shelves this year, \"When Santa Turned Green,\" by Victoria Perla, says that global warming is causing the North Pole itself to melt, potentially leaving Santa homeless.\n\nThe publisher, Thomas Nelson, a publisher of Christian and inspirational books, writes: \"The North Pole is melting because of something called global warming! Faced with the reality of what this could mean for Christmas, not to mention the planet and the future, Santa is determined to turn things around. To do so, he calls upon the people he knows better than any other -- the children.\"\n\nThe book has been given the nod of approval by former Vice President Al Gore.\n\n\"'When Santa Turned Green' helps even the youngest child grasp the importance of caring for our planet and solving the climate crisis,\" Gore said, according to the publisher's Web site.\n\nA musical, \"Santa Goes Green,\" for children in grades 4 through 8, also made its debut this year. The 40-minute production features seven songs.\n\n\"Melting ice caps, global warming, surfing reindeer! The North Pole is going green this year and everyone is excited \u2013 everyone, that is, except Santa who likes things just the way they are,\" publisher Hal Leonard's product description says.\n\nWhile Santa finds going green \"inconvenient,\" the reindeer and Mrs. Claus sing to change his ways.\n\nSong titles include: \"Recycle the Fruitcake,\" \"The Greenhouse Effect\" and \"Turn Off The Pump (And Plug In The Sleigh.)\"",

      "Text": "    By Gary Crosse      NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Insuring against weather-related  calamity in this era of global warming might seem the work of bean  counters and actuaries.      But a study by WeatherBill, an Internet firm offering  weather-related risk cover for individuals, as well as companies and  governments, says the global economy could expand by up to $258  billion if such contracts were more widely purchased.      It calculated country rankings using three types of weighted  data, including weather observations by country, national GDP by  sector and weather elasticity, or sector-specific sensitivity to  weather.      Among the 68 countries in the study, the U.S. economy ranks  nearly last overall using those three measures, but was listed with  the highest weather sensitivity in dollar terms.      'The United States' economy has a total weather sensitivity of  roughly $2.5 trillion, 23 percent of the national economy,'  WeatherBill CEO and founder David Friedberg said. 'In contrast,  Bolivia has a total weather sensitivity of just over $2 billion.  That's 31 percent of the Bolivian economy.'      Customers large or small can create a contract and determine  under what weather conditions they would like to be compensated. The  contracts are purchased online to protect against weather events  such as heavy rains, frost or drought.      In the United States, customers range from professional golf  tour organizers to travel operators to small farmers.      Friedberg, who was formerly with Google <GOOG.O>, told Reuters  the company was selling contracts to corn farmers in the Midwest,  who suffered heavy flooding earlier this year.      With federal crop insurance coverage set to expire at the end of  this month, 'these farmers have corn on the ground and are not  covered for a frost event for the rest of the season and some might  have corn through late October,' he said.      'We're seeing a lot of corn farmers buying coverage from us for  frost from Illinois, Iowa and Minnesota.'           MAKING MILLIONS      As a privately held company, WeatherBill does not issue  financial statements, but the CEO said it had 'made millions of  dollars hedging hundreds of millions of dollars in risk.'      In the report, WeatherBill says countries with more extreme  variations in temperatures as well as higher extractive activity,  such as farming and mining, are the most sensitive.      Brazil, the world's largest coffee and sugar producer, ranked  top among the 68 economies assessed for weather-related risks while  Pakistan's economy ranks the least sensitive.      The study said Brazil was 30 times more vulnerable to weather  risks than Pakistan, which 'means that a dollar in Brazil will be  thirty times more weather-sensitive than a dollar in Pakistan,'  WeatherBill said.      The market for weather derivatives, as such contracts are also  called, was started by now collapsed energy giant Enron about 10  years ago, Friedberg said, but never broadened much outside of the  energy utility sector.      As a result, he said that WeatherBill has so far not seen any  direct competition online.      'We're primarily a technology company and we've built a platform  that allows us to write any sort of weather contract for any sort of  business to protect against their specific risks,' he said. 'We're  really trying to bring these products to the masses.'      Hedging usually involves taking a position in a futures market  that offsets a simila",

      "Text": "    GENEVA, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Space agencies including NASA  have agreed to use their next generation of satellites to help  monitor climate change, the United Nations weather agency said.      The consensus came at a high-level meeting this week in New  Orleans, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said.      'High-tech efforts to better understand global warming have  been strengthened after the world's space and meteorological  agencies gave their support to a WMO strategy for the enhanced  use of satellites to monitor climate change and weather,' the  WMO said in a statement issued late on Thursday.      The aim is to ensure that satellites launched over the next  20 years constantly record parameters such as sea levels and  greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.      Senior officials from NASA, the European Space Agency and  space agenices in Japan, China, Brazil and India attended the   two-day meeting where WMO presented its strategy.      'Every agency which attended supported it,' WMO spokesman  Paul Garwood said.      Climate change monitoring requires very long-term continuous  measurement, according to Jerome Lafeuille, who heads the  space-based observing system division of WMO's space programme.  Satellites are essential to this, because they give a global  picture of changes in the oceans, on land and in the atmosphere.      Scientists blame climate change mainly on human emissions of  greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels and warn it will  bring extreme weather including more heatwaves, droughts, floods  and rising seas.      At least 16 geo-stationary and low-earth orbit satellites  currently provide operational data on the planet's climate and  weather as part of WMO's global observation system.

'South African financial institutions have very little  direct exposure to sub-prime-related assets and their balance  sheets are likely to remain healthy,' the bank said in its  latest Financial Stability Review, focusing on the six months to  June 2008.

      "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Global institutional  investors holding more than $6 trillion in assets pushed  policymakers on Tuesday to quickly hash out a binding agreement  to cut greenhouse gas emissions and promote clean technology.      More than 130 big investors, including London Pensions Fund  Authority, want countries to agree to reduce the climate-  warming emissions by 50 percent to 80 percent by 2050.      Those numbers are in line with global warming policy  favored by U.S. President-elect Barack Obama, who supports an  80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by mid-century.      The investors also want policymakers to set long and medium  term emission reduction targets for developed countries and to  provide for an expanded and more liquid global carbon market.      Already big U.S. investors, such as the California Public  Employees' Retirement System, with $185.6 billion of assets  under management, have been calling for legislation to promote  new and existing clean technologies.      They have also called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission to force publicly traded companies to disclose  climate-related risks along with other factors that affect  their business.      'As institutional investors, we are concerned with the  risks presented by climate change to the global economy and to  our diversified portfolios,' said Mike Taylor, chief executive  of London Pensions Fund Authority. 'We are ... urging world  leaders to implement strong and effective policies to support  us in allocating capital towards low carbon investments.'      The group of global investors want countries to sign on to  a new binding agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol climate  pact, which set binding targets for industrialized countries to  cut greenhouse gas emissions.      The European Union is aiming to cut greenhouse gas  emissions 20 percent by 2020 and increase the share of wind,  solar, hydro, wave power and biofuels in their energy mix by  the same date.      The United States is alone among major industrialized  countries in rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, but is participating  in discussions to craft a follow-up global agreement.      'It is time to put an agreement in place where the United  States is involved,' said Mindy Lubber, the president of Ceres,  a coalition of investors and environmental groups working on  climate change issues.      The global group of investors is hoping its voice is heard  ahead of a December climate change convention in Poland.

Senior officials from NASA, the European Space Agency, and  space agencies in Japan, China, Brazil and India are due to  attend the WMO meeting in New Orleans from Jan 15-16.      Satellites are an essential part of efforts to track severe  weather and climate change by providing a global picture of  shifts in the climate system, rising ocean levels, impacts on  land and in the atmosphere, says the WMO.      Scientists blame climate change mainly on human emissions of  greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels and warn it will  bring extreme weather including more heatwaves, droughts, floods  and rising seas.      At least 16 geostationary and low-earth orbit satellites  currently provide operational data on the planet's climate and  weather as part of WMO's global observation system.      There are also numerous experimental satellites designed for  scientific missions or instrument technology demonstration --  measuring variables such as wind, precipitation and temperature  -- whose data WMO wants to ensure is captured long-term.      'We know there are gaps. Climate monitoring needs very  long-term continuity of measurement,' Lafeuille, who heads the  space-based observing system division of WMO's space programme,  told Reuters.      'When you look at satellites programmed over the next two  decades there are a number of extremely useful satellites but  there is no guarantee of continuity of key measurements.'      High on WMO's agenda will be ensuring constant monitoring of  sea levels for several decades, said the French expert.      Measuring the chemical make-up of the atmosphere --  including greenhouse gases such as CO2 as well as aerosols -- is  also key, Lafeuille said.      A record number of 17 satellites are planned for launch in  2008 by countries from China to India and Russia, he said. 'Our  challenge at WMO is to make sure programmes are complementary  and that all together we build an optimised system.'

Wheat output is expected to fall by about 30 percent as a result of the  months-long drought, although corn and soy crops escaped the worst of the  dryness because they are planted in September. The dry spell ended in late  September.      The South American country is a leading global wheat exporter, the No.  2 corn supplier and the third-biggest soybean provider.      'From the start of (the southern hemisphere) spring, there's been a  positive change and the weather has started to get back to normal, which  will benefit crops' development,' the grains exchange report said.      It said forecasts saw rain patterns remaining stable until the end of  January, although strong storms could hit northeastern farming regions with  drier weather in western growing areas.      Higher-than-average temperatures could produce hailstorms between  February and the middle of April, when heavy rains are forecast.      Between April and August next year, there could also be hotter weather  than normal and an early end to the rainy season, according to the weather  report.

      "Text": "    By Michael Perry      SYDNEY, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Snow storms in China that have  killed more than 60 people are not directly linked to climate  change, say scientists, but simply an extreme event caused by  very cold winter temperatures and a La Nina weather pattern.      La Nina has brought moist air over southern China at a time  of very cold winter temperatures, resulting in heavy snow falls,  said Chinese weather experts.      'This is mainly related to abnormal atmospheric circulation  and the La Nina event,' Dong Wenjie of the National Climate  Centre told the official People's Daily.      'The National Climate Centre predicts that this La Nina event  will continue at least up to summer 2008 at a medium to strong  level,' Dong said. 'With climate warming, extreme weather events  are clearly increasing in frequency and intensity.'      The worst snows in 50 years in southern China have hit as  tens of millions of people attempt to return home to celebrate  the Lunar New Year with families.      Australian climate scientist Penny Whetton, one of the  authors of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC) fourth assessment report, said the Chinese explanation for  the storms was valid, adding the bad weather was not linked to  climate change.      'Those conditions are things that occur naturally and so  every few years, few decades, everything just comes together  right to produce an extreme event,' said Whetton, who wrote the  IPCC chapter 'Regional Climate Projections'. The panel's four  reports were released last year in phases.      'My guess is this is a natural event without any particular  reason to link it to climate change. The climate change models  are not predicting increases in snow events like this,' Whetton  told Reuters on Thursday.      She said China could expect a less stable climate because of  global warming, with various regions experiencing drier, wetter,  hotter conditions, as well as more intense tropical storms.      'Cold extremes are generally not predicted to become more  intense and frequent because we have a warming climate,' she  said.            WORLD'S CLIMATE UNBALANCED      But as China warms, its cold northern regions might  experience more intense snow storms as moisture levels in the  atmosphere rise, creating similar conditions to those that have  caused the snow storms now in southern China.      'Snow will hang around for less but you will probably get  more heavy snow events in winter,' said David Jones, head of  climate analysis at Australia's National Climate Centre.      'We are seeing that in places like northern Canada, where  there's been almost a doubling of rain and snow in the last few  decades, and that's exactly what you expect cold polar desert  regions to become, a lot wetter in a warmer world.'      Jones also said China's snow storms could not be directly  linked to climate change, unlike floods, heat waves and fires  that are a result of rising world temperatures and rainfall.      'Winter is a time of year in the northern hemisphere where  you often get these extreme events. We have always had them and  we will always have them,' he said.      One of the world's largest scientific bodies, the American  Geophysical Union, says the world's climate is now out of balance  and the rate of climate change is no longer natural.      In its first revised climate change report since 2003, the  union said last week that the world's climate system was 'now  changin",

      "Text": "    By Mitch Phillips      LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - The International Rugby Board  (IRB) Council controversially agreed on Thursday to introduce a  year-long global trial of 13 changes to the laws of the game,  beginning at the start of the next European season.      The trial of the Experimental Law Variations (ELVs) for a 12  month period starting on Aug. 1, 2008 at all levels of the game  will involve 13 of the 23 ELVs that have been undergoing  experimentation in various tournaments around the world over the  last two years.      'The Council's decision to implement a global trial of ELVs  represents an important milestone for the future of the game,'  the IRB said in a statement, adding that changes not taken up  worldwide would undergo further experiments.      'The southern hemisphere will continue to play under the  various ELV programme environments that exist in that part of  the world at present. It would be unfair to change the playing  environment under which countries in the south are currently  playing in competitions such as the Super 14,' it added.      'Not one of the Council representatives was against the  global implementation of an ELV programme of some description.  Many of the ELVs received unanimous approval as they had clearly  shown potential to be beneficial to the game, thus meriting a  further trial at all levels around the world.'      Not everyone in the game has been so sure of the need for  change, however, particularly in the northern hemisphere where  there is a fear that the changes could reduce the importance of  the set-pieces.      England's Rugby Football Union (RFU) has said it believes  some of the changes could 'fundamentally change the nature of  the game' and launched a nationwide consultation open to anyone  involved in rugby to voice their opinion, while a raft of former  internationals have condemned the changes as unnecessary.      Changes to be trialled worldwide include:   ? Players can defend a maul by pulling it down.   ? Introduction of an offside line five metres behind the  hindmost feet of the scrum.   ? No restriction on the number of players who can participate  in the lineout from either side (minimum of two).   ? The receiver in a lineout must stand two metres back from the  lineout.      Further ELVs to be trialled in an elite northern hemisphere  competition include:   ? For all offences other than offside, not entering through the  gate, and Law 10 - Foul Play, the sanction is a free kick.   ? If the ball is unplayable at the breakdown, the side that did  not take the ball into contact will receive a free kick.   ? If a maul becomes unplayable, the team not in possession at  the start of the maul receives a free kick.

      "Text": "    SYDNEY, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Australia is better placed to  weather the global recession than many developed nations, a top  central banker said on Wednesday, in part because a sound banking  system has allowed rate cuts to be passed on to customers.      Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Assistant Governor Malcolm  Edey said the global outlook was still the worst since the Second  World War, with almost all of Australia's major trading partners  expected to grow well below trend this year, if not contract.      Yet he saw reason to hope that the huge contraction in global  activity seen last quarter was a 'one-off' event and growth would  begin to revive in the second half of this year.      Official forecasts imply that output in the major industrial  economies will contract further in the first half of this year,  but start to pick up later in the year and into 2010,' Edey told  an economics conference.      'The situation is still very uncertain but that seems like a  reasonable expectation,' he added.      Edey was optimistic that Australia would continue to fare  better than many other developed countries, thanks in part to  aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus.      In just six months the central bank has cut its key cash rate  by 4 percentage points to a record low of 3.25 percent, by far  the most aggressive asing since the recession of the early 1990s.      Australia's Labor government also weighed in this month with  a fiscal stimulus package of A$42 billion ($27 billion) in  infrastructure spending and income support, on top of A$10.4  billion of pump priming late last year.  One key difference was that Australia's financial system  remained in much better shape than its international  counterparts, said Edey.      'As a result of that, we have been able to gain much more  traction from cuts in official interest rates,' he said.      In particular, mortgage rates in Australia had fallen by  almost the full 400 basis points since September, a marked  contrast with many other countries, where banks had been more  heavily affected by financial strains and the degree of  pass-through was much more limited.      Also supporting the domestic economy was the sharp fall in  the Australian dollar, which fell over 30 percent against its  U.S. counterpart last year.

      "Text": "    By Tim Gaynor      PHOENIX, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Weather scientists on Tuesday  urged Barack Obama to spend $9 billion on satellites and  research to prepare for hurricanes, tornadoes and wildfires and  examine links between destructive weather and climate change.      Members of the American Meteorological Society meeting in  Phoenix said they want Obama, who becomes U.S. president on  Jan. 20, to provide the funds over the next five years.      'There are some very basic research questions that need to  be addressed so that we can make wise policy ... and better  protect people and infrastructure,' said John Snow, a hurricane  expert at the University of Oklahoma.      Severe weather kills people across the country each year,  and homeowners, businesses and insurers are hit by billions of  dollars in direct damages and disruption to services.      Last year, Hurricanes Ike and Gustav roared over Louisiana  and parts of Texas, killing dozens of people, destroying homes  and disrupting oil and gas production.      The United States needs a new generation of weather  observation satellites to replace aging systems and provide  better forecasting and climate analysis, the scientists said.     'We do not have sufficient (weather observing) satellites  already manufactured to continue beyond the middle of the next  decade,' said Joe Friday, a former president of the society.      'If we lose that satellite capability, we set back  forecasting by 30 years,' he added.      Climate scientists also are seeking to boost the computer  power for climate research and prediction, and funding for  research into the relationship between weather and climate  change.      U.S. weather experts and researchers have presented the  policy proposals to Obama's transition team in Washington.      Last month Obama picked a 'green dream team' to his  administration to battle climate change and push for major  policy changes.      Designees include Nobel Prize-winning physicist Stephen Chu  to head the Energy Department, and John Holdren, a Harvard  University expert on climate change, who will be White House  science adviser.

'The sound macroeconomic framework should permit Australia  to weather the global downturn and contain inflationary  pressures,' the IMF said in a regular national assessment.      The Reserve Bank of Australia ended a period of monetary  policy tightening in early September when it cut cash rates by  25 basis points, after global market strains and tighter  financing conditions reduced the threat of domestic price  pressures.      The IMF said that it backed this action -- the RBA's first  rate cut in seven years -- which it also emphasized had been  accompanied by official 'readiness to follow a cautious  monetary policy aimed at achieving the 2-3 percent inflation  target range over time.'      The IMF also said that following its recent depreciation,  the Australian dollar <AUD=> was 'now broadly in line with  medium-term fundamentals,' while risks linked to a widening in  the country's current account deficit should be offset by  investment.

      "Text": "    LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - There will be many casualties  from the unfolding financial market crisis, which will lead to a  large-scale overhaul of international banking regulations, codes  and risk management, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  Greenspan said.      Writing in the Financial Times, the former Fed chief said  much of the financial system's risk-valuation models failed, not  because they were too complex but because they were 'too simple  to capture the full array of variables governing that drive  global economic reality'.      'The crisis will leave many casualties. Particularly hard  hit will be much of today's financial risk-valuation system,' he  wrote.      While insisting that current risk management models and  econometric forecasting methods remain 'soundly rooted in the  real world,' he said risk management can never be perfect.      'It will eventually fail and a disturbing reality will be  laid bare, prompting an unexpected and sharp discontinuous  response,' Greenspan said.      He added, however, that he hoped one of the casualties from  the worst U.S. financial crisis since World War Two would not be  the spirit of broad self-regulation within financial markets.      Although he said the Basel II international banking  regulatory framework would almost definitely be revamped and  financial institutions' financial models would need to be  re-drafted, Greenspan warned against over-regulation.      'It is important, indeed crucial, that any reforms in, and  adjustments to, the structure of markets and regulation not  inhibit our most reliable and effective safeguards against  cumulative economic failure: market flexibility and open  competition,' he said.

      "Text": "    By Emily Kaiser      WASHINGTON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Barack  Obama can rewrite the Greenspan-era rules of finance, backed by  a solid Democratic majority in Congress and an American public  furious about the credit crisis.      Exit polls showed the economy was the dominant factor in  Obama's decisive victory over Republican Sen. John McCain on  Tuesday, giving the new president a clear mandate to pursue the  more populist approach to capitalism that he promoted  throughout his campaign.      'At a moment like this, we can't afford four more years of  spending increases, poorly designed tax cuts, or the complete  lack of regulatory oversight that even former Federal Reserve  Chairman Alan Greenspan now believes was a mistake,' Obama  wrote in a Wall Street Journal editorial this week.      For Wall Street -- and other finance capitals that followed  New York's lead -- that probably means a flurry of laws aimed  at protecting homeowners and borrowers while tightening  restrictions on banks and the investments they sell.      Obama has also proposed an economic stimulus plan that  would include money for infrastructure, and he favors reforming  the bankruptcy code to help homeowners and make it easier to  restructure troubled mortgages.      Greenspan, a firm believer in free markets, was nicknamed  'the maestro' after his tenure at the U.S. central bank  coincided with a lengthy period of strong economic growth.      But he has since become a symbol of deregulation and  critics have blamed him for allowing financial firms to outgrow  government oversight. As losses piled up around the world in  late October, Greenspan acknowledged that he was 'partially'  wrong to resist regulation of some securities.      'Those of us who have looked to self-interest of lending  institutions to protect shareholder's equity -- myself  especially -- are in a state of shocked disbelief,' Greenspan  told members of Congress.           CLOCK TICKING      Obama will not have the luxury of time. There is little  doubt that the U.S. economy is slipping into a recession,  perhaps the deepest since the 1970s, and the global economy is  in grave danger of its first downturn in seven years.      World leaders are not waiting for the January inauguration  to plan the broadest reform of the global financial system  since the aftermath of the Great Depression in the 1930s. Obama  is not expected to attend a Nov. 15 meeting of the Group of 20  rich and emerging nations to discuss the financial crisis.      Investors are certain that tougher rules are coming.      'Those in the broad financial services industry should  understand that Senator Obama has sent a very clear signal that  he intends to pursue an activist agenda as president,' said  William Donovan, a partner at the Venable law firm in  Washington and former general counsel of the National  Association of Federal Credit Unions.      'Overhaul of the government's financial services regulatory  structure, consolidation of charter types, tougher liquidity  and capital requirements, bankruptcy and credit card reform are  all on the table,' he said.           POISONED CHALICE?      Obama faces the unenviable task of tackling a recession  with a budget deficit swelled by the Iraq war and the $700  billion financial rescue plan.

      "Text": "Badgered by lawmakers, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan denied the nation's economic crisis was his fault on Thursday but conceded the meltdown had revealed a flaw in a lifetime of economic thinking and left him in a \"state of shocked disbelief.\"\n\nGreenspan, who stepped down in 2006, called the banking and housing chaos a \"once-in-a-century credit tsunami\" that led to a breakdown in how the free market system functions. And he warned that things would get worse before they get better, with rising unemployment and no stabilization in housing prices for \"many months.\"\n\nGloomy economic reports backed him up. New jobless claims soared to just under 500,000 for last week, and Goldman Sachs, Chrysler and Xerox all said they were cutting thousands more workers. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrials bounced erratically all day before finishing up 172 points \u2014 after a two-day drop of nearly 750.\n\nThe financial crisis even prompted the Republican Greenspan, a staunch believer in free markets, to propose that government consider tougher regulations, including requiring financial firms that package mortgages into securities to keep a portion as a check on quality.\n\nHe said other regulatory changes should be considered, too, in such areas as fraud.\n\nAlso looking for solutions, another banking regulator told Congress the government was working on a loan-guarantee plan that could help many homeowners escape foreclosure as part of the $700 billion bailout legislation. That plan is being discussed by the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair, who is pushing the idea.\n\nGreenspan's interrogation by the House Oversight Committee was a far cry from his 18 1/2 years as Fed chairman, when he presided over the longest economic boom in the country's history. He was viewed as a free-market icon on Wall Street and held in respect bordering on awe by most members of Congress.\n\nNot now. At an often contentious four-hour hearing, Greenspan, former Treasury Secretary John Snow and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox were repeatedly accused by Democrats on the committee of pursuing an anti-regulation agenda that set the stage for the biggest financial crisis in 70 years.\n\n\"The list of regulatory mistakes and misjudgments is long,\" panel chairman Henry Waxman declared.\n\nGreenspan, 82, acknowledged under questioning that he had made a \"mistake\" in believing that banks, operating in their own self-interest, would do what was necessary to protect their shareholders and institutions. Greenspan called that \"a flaw in the model ... that defines how the world works.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that he had also been wrong in rejecting fears that the five-year housing boom was turning into an unsustainable speculative bubble that could harm the economy when it burst. Greenspan maintained during that period that home prices were unlikely to post a significant decline nationally because housing was a local market.\n\nHe said Thursday that he held to that belief because until the current housing slump there had never been such a significant decline in prices nationwide. He said the current financial crisis had \"turned out to be much broader than anything that I could have imagined.\"\n\nGreenspan's much-anticipated appearance before the House panel came as the Senate Banking Committee held its own hearing on what the government is doing now to get out of the mess.\n\nAssistant Treasury Secretary Neel Kashkari, who is overseeing the $700 billion financial rescue effort that passed Congress on Oct. 3, said the administration was not only working to get federal purchases of bank stock started quickly but also the program to mop up troubled mortgage-related assets. He also said the government was working to make sure that directives in the legislation to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure were being addressed.\n\nKashkari said the plan could include setting standards that banks should follow for reworking mortgages to make them more affordable. He said the administration was considering a recommendation to provide government loan guarantees to cover the reworked mortgages to make the program more attractive to banks.\n\n\"We are passionate about doing everything we can to avoid preventable foreclosures,\" Kashkari told the committee.\n\nThe FDIC's Bair told the same Senate panel that the government needs to do more to help tens of thousands of people avoid foreclosure.\n\nShe said the FDIC was working \"closely and creatively\" with the Treasury Department to come up with a plan.\n\nGreenspan was asked to defend a variety of actions he took as Federal Reserve chairman \u2014 resisting recommendations to use the Fed's powers to crack down on subprime mortgages, for one. And opposing efforts to impose regulations on derivatives, the complex financial instruments that include credit default swaps, which have also figured prominently in the current crisis.\n\nHe said that outside of credit default swaps, the bulk of financial derivatives had not caused major problems. He said the boom in subprime lending occurred because of the huge demand for investment opportunities in a global economy, and he blamed the crash on a failure by investors to properly assess the risks from such mortgages, which went to borrowers with weak credit.\n\nAs for firms that package mortgages into securities, he said, \"As much as I would prefer it otherwise, in this financial environment I see no choice but to require that all securitizers retain a meaningful part of the securities they issue.\"\n\nOn the billions of dollars of losses suffered by financial institutions because of their investments in subprime mortgages, Greenspan said he had been shocked by the failure of banking officials to protect their shareholders from their bad loan decisions.\n\n\"A critical pillar to market competition and free markets did break down,\" Greenspan said. \"I still do not fully understand why it happened.\"\n\nSEC Chairman Cox told the House panel that \"somewhere in this terrible mess, laws were broken.\" And Snow said that lawmakers should have responded more quickly to his pleas for stronger regulation for mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were taken over by the government last month.\n\nIn the meantime, Kashkari, the Treasury official overseeing the bailout program, said there has been much progress, resulting in \"numerous signs of improvement in our markets and in the confidence in our financial institutions.\" Still, he cautioned, \"the markets remain fragile.\"",

He conceded that stagflation -- a combination of weak  growth and high inflation -- was a real concern.      'Oh certainly,' he said when asked if stagflation was a  possible.      Speaking to an audience of 2,000 in Montreal, Greenspan  said asset bubbles do not form when inflation pressures begin  to emerge.      As inflation pressures emerge around the world, he said the  critical issue was a political one. Central bankers will no  doubt act to keep inflation under control, but Greenspan mused  about whether politicians were 'wise enough' to realize that  low inflation is a major factor in economic growth, citing  political pressures on the Fed back in the 1990s when central  bankers were perceived to be more hawkish than the government.      He also said past experience at the Fed has showed that  central banks can do little to pre-emptively act to prevent  bubbles in financial markets, referring to interest rate hikes  in the early 1990s failing to prevent excessive confidence in  stock markets.

      "Text": "    NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - The United States has fallen  into an 'awfully pale recession' and may remain stagnant for the  rest of the year, former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan  was quoted on Monday saying.      'We're in a recession,' Bloomberg news agency reported   Greenspan had said in a television interview. 'But this is an  awfully pale recession at the moment. The declines in employment  have not been as big as you'd expect to see.'      Last week a government report showed employers shed jobs in  April at a slower rate than had been feared, providing some  relief about the slowing economy.      Greenspan doubted there would be an immediate recovery,  saying stagnation for the rest of the year was the most likely  outcome. 'That's certainly the most benevolent scenario,' he  said. 'It's not all that far from being the most probable.'      The economy would not start turning around until home prices  started settling and eased pressure on finance companies to  write off mortgage-related losses, Greenspan said.      Greenspan has said before that the economy is in a  recession, although he also said at that time that it was too  soon to say how deep or prolonged the downturn would be. His  office could not be reached immediately for comment.

      "Text": "    LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve chairman  Alan Greenspan was quoted on Tuesday as saying the United  States was still more likely than not to have a recession  despite relative stabilisation in the economy in recent weeks.      'I still believe there is a greater than 50 percent  probability of recession,' Greenspan told the Financial Times  in an interview published on the newspaper's website.      '(But) that probability has receded a little and I think  the probability of a severe recession has come down markedly,'  said Greenspan.      He said it was 'too soon to tell' whether the worst of the  financial crisis was over as this would depend on what happened  to house prices.      The Financial Times said Greenspan estimated house prices  would fall by another 10 percent from their February levels,  for a total peak-to-trough decline of roughly 25 percent.      If the economy was weak and the market overshot, house  prices could decline by another 5 percent, he said.      'Such house price declines imply a major contraction in the  level of equity in owner-occupied homes, the ultimate  collateral for mortgage-backed securities,' said Greenspan.      He said it was still not clear whether big financial  institutions had taken all the writedowns they would need to  take on higher rated tranches of mortgage-backed credit  products.      Greenspan said he believed there was a 'tug of war' taking  place in the economy, with financial sector stress pulling one  way and strong corporate liquidity pulling the other. Corporate  liquidity was being eroded, but only gradually.      'No one knows how this tug of war will end -- specifically,  whether the financial crisis will end before it drags down the  real economy,' said Greenspan.      The Financial Times said the main risk that Greenspan saw  was that the household savings rate would move up more rapidly  than most analysts expected as home equity fell, the labour  market weakened and access to credit declined.

      "Text": "    SINGAPORE, May 14 (Reuters) - U.S. economic data suggests the  world's biggest economy could face a mild recession, former  Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan was quoted as telling  Asian investors on Wednesday.      'He said that the data coming out of the U.S. so far suggests  a mild recession. The risk is really on the housing side,' a  participant quoted Greenspan as telling a private Deutsche Bank  event.      The former Fed chairman spoke to the meeting in Singapore via  videolink from Washington.      Greenspan, who was quoted as saying earlier this month that  the U.S. had fallen into an 'awfully pale recession', also told  the investor meeting that the credit crisis would end when home  prices in the United States begin to stabilise, members of the  audience said.      'When home prices stabilise that would mark the end of the  credit crisis,' the participant quoted Greenspan as saying.      'The last part of liquidation will only occur in early 2009,  but he argued that it is likely home prices could well stabilise  before that,' the participant, who declined to be identified,  added.      The U.S economy is reeling from a housing-led slowdown. Some  analysts are convinced the economy is already in a recession  despite a 0.6 percent annualised growth rate in the first quarter  of 2008.      The Fed has cut it's key overnight lending rate by 3.25  percentage points to 2.0 percent since mid-September in a bid to  cushion the broader economy from the housing downturn and credit  crisis.      Greenspan also said that global price pressures could remain  firm because the effect of China's cheap exports is waning.      'We are entering a period where the disinflationary pressure  from the exports of China have bottomed out,' the participant  quoted Greenspan as saying.      'Low cost labour in China probably reached its peak in late  2006 and early 2006. We are beginning to see gradually rising  inflationary pressures, which would be probably subdued during  the current period of slowdown, but will surely re-emerge when  the economy begins to pickup,' he quoted Greenspan as saying.

      "Text": "    SINGAPORE, April 8 (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve  Chairman Alan Greenspan has lashed out again at his critics,  saying he was being blamed unfairly for the credit crisis and  that he had no regrets about decisions he took while at the helm.      In an interview in Tuesday's Wall Street Journal, Greenspan,  who left the Fed in early 2006, says critics are ignoring  evidence in his favour and failing to give credit to the thinking  behind the Fed's decision to lower rates when he was in charge.      Critics say Greenspan, under whom U.S. rates went from 6.5  percent in late 2000 to 1 percent in mid-2003, eased policy too  much and then took too long to tighten again. That, they say,  spurred excessive mortgage borrowing and stoked the housing  bubble that is now the root cause of the credit crisis.      But Greenspan said the Fed cut rates to spur growth and  prevent deflation and, at that time, dissenting votes on the  policy committee were from those who wanted rates even lower.      Analysts also blame Greenspan for failing to press for  stricter rules for bank lending to consumers with weaker credit  records, and for not anticipating the subprime mortgage meltdown.      'I was praised for things I didn't do,' Greenspan told the  newspaper. 'I am now being blamed for things that I didn't do.'      In the interview, Greenspan admits he was wrong about the  improbability of a housing bubble.       But WSJ reporter Greg Ip says Greenspan does not share some  foreign central bankers' belief that their job is to defend  against excessive asset-price inflation. No sensible policy, he  maintains, could have prevented the housing bubble.      'I am reasonably certain that I am right here,' Greenspan is  quoted as saying. If proved wrong, he says, 'I will change. I do  not have a vested interest in holding wrong ideas.'      Greenspan said rock-bottom interest rates actually went  against his '19th century' aversion to easy money. 'My inner soul  didn't feel comfortable,' he is quoted as saying.      But he also denies intimidating others into falling in line.      'What I find amusing is that history is being rewritten with  me being portrayed as a force that overwhelms and persuades all  these highly educated, very intelligent people to do my bidding,'  he says in the interview.       'That's just silliness. It's a terrible rewrite of history.'

      "Text": " (Releads with Greenspan interview, comments on recession)      NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is probably in  a recession or about to slide into it, former U.S. Federal  Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in an interview with The  Wall Street Journal.      The odds are 'not overwhelming but they are marginally in  that direction' Greenspan was quoted as saying in the interview,  published on Tuesday.      'The symptoms are clearly there. Recessions don't happen  smoothly. They are usually signaled by a discontinuity in the  market place, and the data of recent weeks could very well be  characterized in that manner,' he said.      Greenspan was reported in December as saying that he saw  chances of a U.S. economic recession at around 50 percent,  compared with his previous view of a 30 percent chance.      In the latest interview, Greenspan referred to a drop in the  Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers index as  well as the rise in unemployment in December, and said the odds  of a recession were still close to 50 percent but 'more likely  higher than lower.'      Greenspan is set to join hedge-fund firm Paulson & Co. as an  adviser, the Journal said.      New York-based Paulson, with assets of $28 billion, is set to  make the announcement on Tuesday, it said.      Greenspan has been criticized by some for keeping the  trendsetting federal funds rate at a low 1 percent from June 2003  through June 2004, which some say contributed to a housing bubble  that is now bursting.      Paulson & Co. was among hedge fund industry's big winners in  2007 after it bet against subprime mortgages.

      "Text": "  (Adds details, background)      NEW YORK, May 8 (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan said on Thursday that the worst of the credit  crisis is over, according to sources who attended a speech he  delivered in New York.      Greenspan said while the current credit crisis was the  worst he had ever seen, the worst was over as low interest  rates meant companies could borrow more cheaply long-term, the  sources who attended his speech at the Alternative Public  Strategies Conference told Reuters.      Conference organizers said Greenspan had requested that  members of the media intending to cover his speech could only  do so in their personal capacity and would not be allowed to  report on whatever he said.      Greenspan also said U.S. house prices still had a long way  to fall and that it was unlikely they would stabilize by  year-end, the sources said.      As chairman of the Federal Reserve, Greenspan oversaw the  reduction of the federal funds rate 1.0 percent in 2003 which  some critics charge provided fuel for the U.S. real estate  bubble that followed.      Greenspan has vehemently rejected assertions that his  monetary policy was the cause of the problem. Low interest  rates and lending practises that saw loans being advanced to  home owners with poor credit histories have been blamed for the  U.S. housing market meltdown.      The U.S economy is reeling from a housing-led slowdown,  with some analysts convinced it is already in a recession  despite a 0.6 percent growth rate in the first quarter of  2008.      The Fed has cut it's key overnight lending rate by 3.25  percentage points to 2.0 percent since mid-September in a bid  to prevent the housing downturn from spilling over to the  broader economy. The aggressive rate cuts were also directed at  healing the fractured credit markets.      According the sources, Greenspan mentioned that United  States growth was likely to be sluggish for an extended period  of time but that a so-called doomsday scenario was unlikely to  materialize.      On Monday, Greenspan was quoted by Bloomberg news agency as  saying that the U.S. growth had fallen into an 'awfully pale  recession' and might remain stagnant for the rest of the year.

      "Text": "    SYDNEY, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Australia's gay capital Sydney is  set to try and enforce homophobia-free zones which may see clubs  and hotels lose their licence if patrons commit homophobic abuse  or violence, local media said on Sunday.      The move will focus on the city's main gay precinct Oxford  Street, site of the world's biggest gay and lesbian Mardi Gras  each year, and other areas deemed gay and lesbian precincts.      Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore said the move recognised the  'essential gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender character of  Oxford St' and was a response to gay men who had written to her  about homophobic abuse at nightclubs, said news.com.au.      Sydney's gay media routinely run stories of homophobic abuse  in Oxford St and the gay community has worked with police for  several years to try reduce abuse along the strip.      The council will consult with police, the Aids Council of  NSW and other community groups to develop the strategy.      The move could require local businesses to use signs and  stickers to declare their premises homophobia free and to  include anti-homophobia measures in staff training.      Sydney city councillor Phillip Black, who proposed the plan,  said the idea was similar to alcohol-free or nuclear-free zones  that already exist in the city.      'At this point, the ball is with council staff to develop a  proposal that will come back to council over the next few  months, but it could involve stickers, badges, posters and  T-shirts similar to the Safe Place pink triangle campaign,'  Black said.      'We have to create awareness that homophobia is not  acceptable,' he said.      Sydney Drag Queen Maxi Shield, a City of Sydney Oxford  Street Safety ambassador, welcomed the idea but called for more  police on the street to protect gays.      'More education in anything doesn't go astray, but we need  both awareness and more police,' Shield said. 'We need more  police presence and safety measures, not just putting a label on  it.'

      "Text": "Americans' fears over the safety of schools continues.\n\nLast Monday, three colleges and four K-to-12 schools were shut down by threats of violence.\n\nThis week over 25,000 college students at 300 chapters in 44 states belong to a group, Students for Concealed Carry on College Campuses, that will carry empty handgun holsters to protest their concerns about not being able to defend themselves.\n\nWith the first anniversary of the Virginia Tech attack last week and the discussions that it created, we clearly have not been able to put that and other attacks behind us. There are good reasons why the safety measures adopted over the last year to speed up response times or hiring more police haven't eliminated the fear people feel.\n\nThe attack earlier this year at Northern Illinois University proved that even six minutes was too long. It took six minutes before the police were able to enter the classroom, and in that short time five people were murdered. Compared to the Virginia Tech and other attacks, six minutes is actually record breaking speed, but it was simply not fast enough.\n\nThe Thursday before the NIU murders five people were killed in a city council chambers in Kirkwood, Mo. There was even a police officer already there when the attack occurred. But as happens time after time in these attacks, when uniformed police are there, the killers either wait for the police to leave the area or they are the first people killed. In Kirkwood, the police officer was killed immediately when the attack started. People cowered or were reduced to futilely throwing chairs at the killer.\n\nThere is a problem that people just are unwilling to recognize.\n\nJust like attacks last year at the Westroads Mall in Omaha, Neb., or Trolley Square Mall in Salt Lake City or the recent attack at the Tinley Park Mall in Illinois or all the public schools attacks, all these cases had one thing in common: They took place in \u201cgun free zones,\u201d where private citizens were not allowed to carry their guns with them.\n\nThe malls in Omaha and Salt Lake City were in states that let people carry concealed handguns, but private property owners are allowed to post signs banning guns and those malls were among the few places in their states that chose to post such signs. In the Trolley Square attack an off-duty police officer fortunately violated the ban and stopped the attack. The attacks at Virginia Tech or the other public schools occured in some of the few areas within their states that people are not allowed to carry concealed handguns.\n\nIt is not just recent killings that are occurring in these gun-free zones. Multiple-victim public shootings keep on occurring in places where guns are banned. Nor are these horrible incidents limited to just gun-free zones in the US.\n\nIn 1996 Martin Bryant killed 35 people at Port Arthur in Tasmania, Australia. In the last half-dozen years, European countries including France, Germany and Switzerland have experienced multiple-victim shootings. The worst school attack in Germany claimed 17 deaths, another 14 deaths; one attack in Switzerland claimed the lives of 14 regional legislators.\n\nAt some point you would think that something is going on here, that these murderers aren\u2019t just picking their targets at random. Yet, when one thinks about it, this pattern isn\u2019t really too surprising.\n\nMost people understand that guns deter criminals. The problem is that instead of gun-free zones making it safe for potential victims, they make it safe for criminals.\n\nCriminals are less likely to run into those who might be able to stop them. Everyone wants to keep guns away from criminals, but the problem is who is more likely to obey the law.\n\nA student expelled for violating a gun-free zone at a college is extremely unlikely ever to get into another college. A faculty member fired for a firearms violation will find it virtually impossible to get another academic position. But even if the killer at Virginia Tech had lived, the notion that the threat of expulsion would have deterred the attacker when he would have already faced 32 death penalties or at least 32 life sentences seems silly.\n\nLetting civilians have permitted concealed handguns limits the damage from attacks. A major factor in determining how many people are harmed by these killers is the amount of time that elapses between when the attack starts and when someone with a gun is able to arrive on the scene.\n\nIn cases from the church shooting in Colorado Springs, Colo., last December, where a parishioner who was given permission by the minister to carry her concealed gun into the church quickly stopped the murderer, to an attack last year in downtown Memphis, to the Appalachian Law School, to high schools in such places as Pearl, Miss., concealed handgun permit holders have stopped attacks well before uniformed police could possibly have arrived.\n\nTwice this year armed Israeli citizens have stopped terrorist attacks at schools (once by an armed teacher and another by an armed student). Indeed, despite the fears being discussed about the risks of concealed handgun permit holders, I haven\u2019t found one multiple-victim public shooting where a permit holder has accidentally shot a bystander.\n\nWith about 5 million Americans currently with concealed handgun permits in the U.S. and states starting having right-to-carry laws for as long as 80 years, we have a lot of experience with these laws, and one thing is very clear: Concealed handgun permit holders are extremely law-abiding and lose their permits for any gun-related violation at hundredths or thousandths of one percentage point. We also have a lot of experience with permitted concealed handguns in schools.\n\nPrior to the 1995 Safe School Zone Act, states with right-to-carry laws let teachers or others carry concealed handguns at school, and several states still allow this today. And there is not a single instance that I or others have found where this produced a single problem. There are today even some universities, including large public universities such as Colorado State University and the University of Utah, that let students carry concealed handguns on school property.\n\nWith all the news media coverage of the types of guns used and how the criminal obtained the gun, at some point the news media might begin to mention the one common feature of these attacks: they keep occurring in gun-free zones.\n\nGun-free zones are a magnet for these attacks. But, even without the media, considering that 15 more states this year debated legislation to let concealed handguns on school campuses, possibly the issue is becoming clear anyway.\n\nJohn Lott is the author of Freedomnomics and a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland.",

      "Text": "    By Carey Gillam      KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 22 (Reuters) - A Missouri car dealer  said on Thursday sales have soared at his auto and truck  business since launching a promotion this week that promises  buyers a free handgun or a $250 gas card with every purchase.      Max Motors, a small Butler, Missouri dealership that has as  its logo a grimacing cowboy wielding a pistol, has sold more  than 30 cars and trucks in the last three days, far more than  its normal volume. And owner Mark Muller credits his decision  to start offering buyers their choice of a $250 gas card or a  $250 credit at a gun shop.      'This thing has taken off. Sales have quadrupled,' said  Muller. The store sells both used and new vehicles including  General Motors <GM.N> and Ford <F.N> products.      Every buyer so far 'except one guy from Canada and one old  guy' has elected to take the gun, Muller said. Muller  recommends his customers select a Kel-Tec .380 pistol.      'It's a nice little handgun that fits in your pocket,' he  said.      Muller said the promotion was inspired by Illinois Sen.  Barack Obama, who is vying with Hillary Clinton to be the  Democratic nominee for the presidential election in November.      'We did it because of Barack Obama. He said all those  people in the Midwest, you've got to have compassion for them  because they're clinging to their guns and their Bibles. I  found that quite offensive.'      'We all go to church on Sunday and we all carry guns,' said  Muller. 'I've got a gun in my pocket right now. I have a rifle  in my truck. We've got to shoot the coyotes out here, they're  attacking our cows, our chickens. We're not clinging to  nothing. We're just damn glad to live in a free country where  you can have a gun if you want. This is the way it ought to  be.'

      "Text": "    SAN FRANCISCO, June 27 (Reuters) - A day after the U.S.  Supreme Court struck down a ban on handguns in Washington,  D.C., the National Rifle Association gun rights group filed  lawsuits on Friday in San Francisco and Chicago against gun  bans there.      'The Supreme Court held yesterday that the Second Amendment  right is exercised individually and belongs to all Americans,'  Chris Cox, the NRA's chief lobbyist, said in a statement.  'These lawsuits will ensure that state and local governments  hear those words.'      The San Francisco lawsuit challenges a local ordinance and  lease provisions barring possession of handguns by public  housing residents.      The Chicago case challenges a handgun ban similar to the  Washington, D.C., law struck down by the Supreme Court. The NRA  also filed lawsuits challenging gun restrictions in the Chicago  suburbs of Evanston, Morton Grove and Oak Park.      'In Washington, D.C., or in any state, whether you live in  the housing projects or a high end suburb, you have the right  to defend yourself and your family at home,' Cox said. 'These  laws all deny that right.'      In its 5-4 decision, the court held that individual  Americans have a right to own guns, a finding that struck down  a strict gun control law in the nation's capital.      The landmark ruling marked the first time in nearly 70  years the high court addressed the Second Amendment of the U.S.  Constitution, and rejected the argument that the amendment's  right to keep and bear arms is tied to service in a state  militia.      San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom said he had expected the  decision to open the door for a challenge to his city's gun  laws.      'I intend to fight any NRA lawsuit that challenges our  common-sense gun laws every step of the way,' he said in a  statement.      San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera echoed Newsom.      'On the basis of the law as it exists today, I am confident  that our local gun control measures are on sound legal footing  and will survive legal challenges,' Herrera said in a  statement.

      "Text": " (Bernd Debusmann is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed  are his own)       By Bernd Debusmann      WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Is America, land of shooting  massacres in schools and public places, slowly falling out of  love with guns?       The answer is yes, and it runs counter to popular  perceptions of the United States as a country where most  citizens are armed to the teeth and believe it is every  American's inalienable right to buy an AK 47-style assault rifle  with the minimum of bureaucratic paperwork.      But in fact, gun ownership in the United States has been  declining steadily over more than three decades, relegating gun  owners to minority status.       At the same time, support for stricter gun controls has been  growing steadily and those in favour make up a majority.      This is a little-reported phenomenon but the trend is shown  clearly by statistics compiled by the University of Chicago's  National Opinion Research Center (NORC), which has been tracking  gun ownership and attitudes on firearms since 1972, the  longest-running survey on the subject in the United States.       The number of households with guns dropped from a high of 54  percent in 1977 to 34.5 percent in 2006, according to NORC, and  the percentage of Americans who reported personally owning a gun  has shrunk to just under 22 percent.        So, by the rules of democratic play, one might assume that  the majority would have major influence on legislation. But  that's not how it works, thanks to the enormous influence of the  gun lobby.       The long-term decline monitored by the Chicago survey has  buoyed proponents of tighter gun controls. 'America's gun  culture is fading,' says Josh Sugarmann, who heads the  Washington-based Violence Policy Center.       According to Sugarmann, those keeping the culture alive and  those most vocal in resisting tighter regulations are white,  middle-aged men whose enthusiasm for firearms, hunting and  shooting is not shared by younger Americans.      Yet, at the moment it's difficult to imagine the U.S.  without its gun culture.       But then, who could have imagined France with a ban on  smoking in public places, Germany with speed limits on almost  half its autobahns, or a black man as a serious contender in  this year's presidential elections in the United States?      To what extent gun ownership will continue to shrink  depends, at least in part, on a decision by the U.S. Supreme  court expected this summer. The court will rule on one of the  most acrimonious disputes in the United States: do Americans  have the constitutional right to own and bear arms?            GUN RAMPAGES PART OF LIFE      At the heart of the long-running debate, argued with more  passion than almost any other, is the meaning of the U.S.  constitution's second amendment.       Written 219 years ago, it says: 'A well regulated Militia,  being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of  the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'      A string of lower court rulings over several decades held  that the amendment meant to guarantee the collective right of  state militias, not individual citizens. Such rulings have had  limited impact: gun regulations vary from state to state and in  most, weapons are easy to buy and legal to keep.      There are a few exceptions: handguns are illegal in Chicago  and in Washington, where a court ruled in December that its  total ban violated the constitution. That ",

      "Text": "Despite the high emotions that surround war \u2014 or perhaps because of them \u2014 people are focusing again on \"normal\" life. But what is normal has shifted in ways both obvious and subtle. Consider how war has affected just one issue: the debate over gun control.\n\nFor years, gun ownership advocates have agonized over how to make women comfortable around guns. As of 2000, 41.7 percent of men and 28.5 percent of women reported having a gun in their household, and 39.2 percent of men but only 10 percent of women personally owned a gun.\n\nReaching out to women and minorities has been a high priority of organizations like the National Rifle Association, not merely to swell their ranks but also to convert segments of society that have traditionally opposed the right to own a gun.\n\nNow, the outreach has become easier. As of 2002, over 210,000 women were on active duty within the military, over 150,000 were in the reserves. A steep increase in the number of women in the military means that an unprecedented number of Gen-Next women have overcome their mothers' aversion to guns.\n\nNon-military women also picked up guns. NRA spokeswoman Nance Pretto reported that, in the wake of Sept. 11, women's enrollment in instructional shooting classes increased fourfold from years before. And gun dealers reported a sharp increase in women purchasing weapons.\n\nThe sense of insecurity caused by Sept. 11 was heightened as police officers in the reserves left for active duty, depleting police departments. Some politicians began to actively encourage women to protect themselves by owning guns. When a serial killer was loose in Baton Rouge in the summer of 2002, Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster advised women \"you have a right to get a [concealed] gun permit. ... if you know how [to use a gun] and you have a situation with some fruitcake running around, like they've got right now, it sure can save you a lot of grief.\"\n\nFoster received the predictable backlash of outrage from gun control advocates who suddenly sounded sexist. Holley Galland Haymaker from the anti-gun group Louisiana Ceasefire argued: \"Maybe if you're a big, white guy who hunts all the time, it might do some good. For a woman who is surprise attacked, having a gun is only giving them [the attacker] another way to kill you.\"\n\nI will ignore the racist implications of this remark and simply ask, \"Why would a white guy who hunts be more competent with a gun than a woman who is trained to use it?\"\n\nTo judge from how strained their arguments have become, gun control advocates realize they are losing the debate. It would be difficult to escape this realization. Last Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1036 \u2014 the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \u2014 which grants gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits resulting from their products. The vote (04/09) was 285 to 140. The measure has now moved to the Senate where it is expected to pass.\n\nAs Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., argued, \"Manufacturers of legal products should not live under the threat of litigation simply because their product is misused ... [W]e don't sue Ginsu when someone is stabbed to death with their knife.\"\n\nAgain, the anti-gun arguments were shrill. A paper published by the Brady Center, entitled \"Smoking Guns: Exposing the Gun Industry's Complicity in the Illegal Gun Market,\" openly accused the firearms industry of \"actively and knowingly allowing guns to be sold into the illegal market.\" In short, gun manufacturers were publicly charged with criminal complicity.\n\nOther gun control advocates are pushing to have guns declared as \"weapons of mass destruction (WMD).\" For example, House Bill 1210 in Washington State defined a WMD as a \"device, object, or substance that a person intends to use to cause multiple human deaths.\" No specific weapons were mentioned but the Seattle Times opened its March 15 coverage of the bill with the sentence, \"An anti-terrorism bill has spurred debate among lawmakers: Is a gun a weapon of mass destruction?\" Possession would have been a class A felony had the bill passed with above-referenced language. Many in the pro-gun rights camp view the WMD argument as an indication of attacks to come.\n\nThe underlying facts of the gun debate remain much the same as before Sept. 11 and the war. The award-winning criminologist Prof. Gary Kleck states that firearms are used defensively 2.5 million times a year. 48 percent of those incidents involve women defending themselves; most of the time a shot is not fired. The conclusion: women benefit from gun ownership.\n\nWhat is changing, however, are the faces and attitudes of the debate. A growing number of women feel comfortable with guns and want them for self-defense. In response, anti-gun advocates are using arguments that seem increasingly implausible such as classifying guns as WMDs.\n\nGun ownership is just one of the issues over which we will stumble on the way back to normal life. And, as people drink coffee and read newspapers in the morning, they will discover that the war has influenced every aspect of public debate, including the words we use to describe and redefine our beliefs.\n\nWendy McElroy is the editor of ifeminists.com and a research fellow for The Independent Institute in Oakland, Calif.

In an open letter to world leaders and combatants in war  zones, 31 Nobel laureates said that more than 70 million  children around the world did not have the chance of an  education and more than half of these lived in conflict areas.      The Nobel laureates included former U.S. President Jimmy  Carter, the Dalai Lama, South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu,  detained Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and  organisations such as Amnesty International.      'War and conflict are perpetrated by adults. But every adult  was once a child and grew up with experiences and guidance that  shaped their lives. At the heart of this lies education,' they  said in the letter, backing a campaign by British charity Save  the Children.      The Nobel laureates called on governments and other parties  to armed conflicts to respect schools as places of peace and  safety, where children could learn free from violence or fear of  recruitment into the armed forces.

      "Text": "    By Ed Stoddard      FORT WORTH, Texas, June 26 (Reuters) - Gun-loving Americans  applauded their Supreme Court on Thursday after it ruled for  the first time in U.S. history that they had a right to own  firearms.      'I think it's great because Americans should have the  freedom to own guns and rifles, because America is a so-called  free country and that is one of our freedoms,' said 16-year-old  high school student and avid raccoon hunter Stella Richardson.      She and her mother were buying a new pistol holster for her  father at a Cabela's shop in Fort Worth, part of a chain  catering to U.S. hunters and gun enthusiasts.      The reaction to the decision was universally favorable  among those browsing in the firearms section of the store,  where hundreds of handguns gleam in glass display cases in  front of long rows of rifles and shotguns.      Individual Americans have a right to own guns, the Supreme  Court ruled for the first time in the country's history,  striking down a strict gun control law in Washington D.C.      The landmark 5-4 ruling marked the first time in nearly 70  years that the high court had addressed the Second Amendment of  the U.S. Constitution.      'I think the decision should have been nine to zero,' said  Don Polk, 60, as he browsed for a handgun.      'I think people up there in Washington should be able to  protect themselves the way that the rest of us have been  allowed to,' he said.      Buying a firearm is not a big problem in Texas where it is  even possible and fairly easy to obtain a permit to carry a  concealed handgun. A 'castle law' enables homeowners here to  shoot intruders if they feel threatened.      Bob Schultz, a Vietnam veteran and gun owner in a Dallas  suburb, spoke to Reuters in his home as he opened his .38  special to show that it was loaded -- as always.      'I wholeheartedly agree with this Supreme Court decision.  But I don't think it will deter the anti-gun lobby, they will  continue to crusade against weapons,' he said.      Besides two handguns, his main 'home defense' system is a  12-gauge pistol grip shotgun with a short barrel. At close  range that will put a big hole in an unwanted intruder.      At Cabela's, 71-year-old Bonnie Deberry browsed with her  husband for new handguns to add to their collection.      'I think you ought to be able to have one and carry them  openly. This country was built on guns,' she said.   (Editing by Anthony Boadle)   ((edward.stoddard@reuters.com; +1 817 421 4743))  Keywords: USA GUNS/COURT GUNSHOP        ",

      "Text": "    NEW DELHI, April 11 (Reuters) - India's trade minister on  Friday defended controversial industry zones, which have been  opposed by poor farmers angered by the compensation on offer for  their land, saying they will generate exports worth $31.25  billion by the end of this financial year.    'The government sees SEZs as vehicles of industrialisation  and employment generation,' Kamal Nath said of the so-called  special economic zones (SEZs).      'It is projected that the exports from SEZs would reach 1.25  trillion rupees by the end of this financial year.      'Development of this nature reassures us of the validity of  the basic policy relating to SEZs notwithstanding the scepticism  expressed by a few persons,' he said.      In January, the tourist state of Goa dropped plans to build  SEZs after protests, and in 2007, forced purchases of farmland  provoked violent protests in the eastern state of West Bengal  where more than 30 people were killed in clashes over a proposed  chemicals zone.      The federal government has approved 453 industrial zones  spread over 19 states, which could employ 280,000 workers.

      "Text": "    FRANKFURT, Jan 8 (Reuters) - German energy regulator  Bundesnetzagentur said on Tuesday the number of German gas  market zones would be cut to eight by October to boost trading  and make customer switches less expensive and complicated.      The authority's president Matthias Kurth said in a statement  that gas grid operators had responded to calls to link  previously separate zones so as to simplify shipping procedures  and help consumers.      'Our goal to cut the number of such zones to below 10 will  be reached...towards our ambition to create more liquidity and  competition,' Kurth said.      The announcement came a day after two gas network operators,  Bayernets and E.ON Gastransport (EGT) <EONG.DE>, said they would  handle gas from the North Sea coast through to the Alps for  potentially half of Germany's preferred gas type called H-Gas in  one joint zone from October.      This cut the number of zones already to 11 compared with  over 700 two years ago when the gas market had not yet emerged.      The latest move brought about by the regulator will entail  three networks, those of the transport arms of southern German  GVS, Italy's ENI <ENI.MI> and GdF Deutschland <GDF.PA> to be  brought together, the statement said.      Another zone of operator Gas Union would also cease to exist  in its current form in the autumn, when a new gas delivery year  starts, the Bundesnetzagentur said.      Apart from EGT/Bayernets and the new three-party zone, that  would leave zones operated by RWE <RWEG.DE>, Wingas  <BASF.DE><GAZP.MM>, VNG-Ontras, EWE and EVG Muenster and  northern German BEB, which Shell <RDSa.L> and ExxonMobil <XOM.N>  recently agreed to sell to Dutch state company Gasunie.      Wholesale gas traders say the nascent marketplace needs a  few zones as possible allow for quick shipments through the  pipeline grid, which is the basis of a functioning market.      Encouraged by the changes, Germany's energy bourse EEX last  October started trading a gas contract in the BEB and E.ON  zones.

      "Text": "    June 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Thursday,  for the first time in the country's history, that individual  Americans have the right to own guns for personal use, and struck  down a strict gun control law in the U.S. capital, Washington.           Following are some facts about the case.           * It marks the first time in nearly 70 years that the Supreme  Court has taken up the meaning of the Second Amendment, the  portion of the U.S. Constitution that addresses an individual's  right to bear arms.      * The Supreme Court's previous review of the Second  Amendment came in a five-page discussion in an opinion issued  in 1939 that failed to definitively resolve the constitutional  issue.      * At issue was the city's strict gun-control law -- a ban on  private possession of handguns and requirement that any rifles or  shotguns kept at home be unloaded and disassembled or bound by a  trigger lock.      * The court's ruling could have a far-reaching impact on  gun-control laws in the United States, which is estimated to have  the world's highest civilian gun ownership rate. The ruling could  become an issue in the November presidential election.      * During oral arguments in March, Justice Stephen Breyer  cited statistics that between 80,000 and 100,000 people in the  United States every year are killed or wounded in gun-related  homicides or crimes, accidents or suicides. He said that in  Washington, D.C., the number totals around 200 to 300 dead and  between 1,500 to 2,000 people wounded.      * The arguments followed a string of mass shootings in the  previous year -- multiple killings on at least three college  campuses, two shopping centers and one Missouri town meeting.      * The case divided the Bush administration. Then-Solicitor  General Paul Clement, the administration's lawyer before the  Supreme Court, said individuals have a right to own a gun, but  it is subject to reasonable government regulation. Vice  President Dick Cheney joined a group of U.S. House of  Representatives and Senate members in urging a stronger stand  in favor of gun rights.

      "Text": "    By Ashleigh Patterson      TORONTO, May 27 (Reuters) - Firearm enthusiasts slammed  Toronto's proposed anti-gun measures on Tuesday, which would  see shooting ranges, gun clubs and firearm manufacturers banned  from Canada's largest city.      Toronto Mayor David Miller announced on Monday he will  support staff recommendations contained in a new report that  recommends restrictions on land use for the manufacture,  distribution, assembly, warehousing and discharge of guns as  part of the city's move to reduce gun crime.      The report also calls for new zoning regulations that would  eliminate recreational use of firearms, effectively terminating  permits for gun clubs in Toronto.      Marc Porter, a member of the Forest Hill Revolver Club, who  owns two target pistols, said Miller was 'misguided in his  quest' to rid the city's streets of gun violence, adding that  only athletes and hobbyists will suffer.      'I've been doing this for 31 years and we are not the  problem. We are not training criminals; we are not offering  criminals instruction,' Porter said.      Inspector Tony Cooper, Ontario's acting chief firearms  officer, said the clubs have not been a public safety issue      'It's the mayor's prerogative to do whatever he likes, but  we have had no problem with those particular ranges,' he said.      In April, Miller launched an online petition for a  Canada-wide handgun ban after two innocent bystanders were  fatally shot downtown in January.      According to a city report, more than 1,200 Canadians are  killed and over 1,000 are injured by firearms each year. In  2006, Toronto experienced the highest number of victims of  firearm-related violent crimes in Canada.      Canada's firearm-related homicide rate is six times lower  than that of the United States, however it is three times  higher than Australia's and six times higher than that of  England and Wales, according a 2006 Statistics Canada report.

      "Text": "    By Carey Gillam      KANSAS CITY, Mo., Feb 4 (Reuters) - Tom Effertz is 73 and a  wheat farmer. Rosie Erganian is 52 and lives in a town on the  Missouri River. He's a Republican. She's a Democrat. Both  Missourians want anyone but Democrat Hillary Clinton for U.S.  president.      'We're tired of the Hillary thing,' Effertz said. 'We'd had  enough of Bill and Hillary.'      'I do not like the way they've been kind of nasty,' said  Erganian, of Rocheport, Missouri. 'I don't want anybody in  office like that.'      Tuesday is 'Super Tuesday' when 24 states, Missouri among  them, hold nominating contests for one or both parties. It is  the biggest date in the six-month process to decide which of  each party will face off in the Nov. 4 election to succeed  President George W. Bush.       When it comes to the November election, Missouri, home to  the plain-speaking late President Harry Truman in the heart of  America, has long been viewed as a bellwether, having voted for  the winner in every presidential ballot except one since 1904.      The former first lady is virtually tied with Illinois Sen.  Barack Obama among Democrats in Missouri, according to a  Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll released on Sunday. Super Tuesday  could be a tight race nationwide for the two Democrats.      On the Republican side Sen. John McCain leads former  Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in most states, but not in  the big-prize state of California.      Strong anti-Clinton feeling has people in both parties  speculating that if the New York senator wins the Democratic  nomination she could become a powerful unifying force -- for  Republicans.           'VETTED, TESTED'      The Clintons have been on the national political stage  since Bill Clinton won the presidency in 1992. Once his second  term ended in 2001, Hillary Clinton began her own, official,  political career by winning a Senate seat from New York.      'I've been taking the incoming fire from Republicans for  about 16 years now, and I'm still here, because I have been  vetted, I have been tested,' she said on Sunday on ABC's 'This  Week.'      Obama's supporters and Republican leaders alike say  although many voters passionately support Clinton, at least as  many passionately dislike her. They offer various explanations  and acknowledge that at least some are unfair.      Some anger at her is residual resentment of her husband  whose second term was mired in a long impeachment process  stemming from an extramarital relationship.  For some it's  about her policies -- pro-gun control, for universal health  care.       Others cite a personality they see as too aggressive and  insincere.      Clinton's campaign has brushed aside the concerns, saying  she has a proven track record of winning, in her New York  campaigns and in voting last month in New Hampshire and Nevada.  Obama won in Iowa and South Carolina.      'I can go up against Senator McCain or any of the  Republicans and be able to defend our positions, put them  forward to the American people and make an affirmative case as  to why I should be the president,' Clinton said on ABC.      'Her record of reaching out across the aisle to find common  solutions is the reason ... she has such a strong record of  getting results,' said Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee,  insisting that Clinton had growing support among Republicans  and independent voters.           'HIGH NEGATIVES'      Concerns among Democrats about how Clinton might energize  Republicans",

      "Text": "As you know if you watch us on a regular basis, we are fair to Senator Clinton. We treat her the same way we treat all the other candidates, with a healthy dose of skepticism but an open mind. Looking back on my campaign analysis so far, I've been much tougher on John Edwards than Mrs. Clinton because I believe Mr. Edwards is a charlatan and his campaign of class warfare is foolish.\n\nHillary Clinton is waging a conventional campaign. She has a strong machine, unlimited money, and the heavy odds are she will win the Democratic nomination. But her performance on illegal aliens getting driving credentials has been abysmal.\n\nAfter two weeks, two weeks she now says she would not give driver's licenses to people in the U.S. illegally. But why? Why would Hillary Clinton deny driver's licenses to illegal aliens? The senator will not say.\n\n\"Talking Points\" went to a website. No mention of why no licenses. We contacted her press secretary Felipe Reines. He couldn't tell us why. We called Senator Clinton's main man Howard Wolfson. He would not take the call.\n\nThe truth is nobody knows why Hillary Clinton doesn't want to give illegals driving privileges because she simply doesn't want to tell us. Doesn't want to define the issue.\n\nThat's what bothers me about Senator Clinton. I can't figure out what she believes. Most politicians are shifty. Most change positions to get votes, but there comes a time when specific questions have to be answered.\n\nMillions of Americans will vote for Hillary Clinton no matter what she says. And millions will vote against her no matter what she says. But for those of us who take an independent view, and we will decide the presidential election, the failure to address important issues in a clear way is a huge deficit.\n\nI strongly believe Senator Clinton believes she can become president without ever having to reveal who she really is or what she really thinks. This illegal license deal reinforces my belief.\n\nPinheads and Patriots\n\nAs you may know, the entertainment writers are on strike, and that means no money for them. But our pal David Letterman says he will pay his writers and his entire staff out of his own pocket for the next few weeks. That is very generous. And tonight, David Letterman is a patriot.\n\nOn the pinhead front, in Sydney, Australia, Sari Haggerty, the national Santa coordinator for a company which supplies Santas to department stores and such, has ordered St. Nick not to say, \"Ho, ho, ho\" this season. Apparently, Ms. Haggerty believes some Australian women may be offended by \"ho, ho, ho,\" so Santa must now say, \"Ha, ha, ha.\"\n\nThis is not a joke. This is stupid. So Sari Haggerty is a pinhead. Leave Santa alone, mate.\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads and Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

      "Text": "    June 4 (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton lost a historic and  grueling race for the Democratic presidential nomination to  Barack Obama on Tuesday but refused to concede, raising  questions about what she wants next.      The question was so prevalent, in fact, that Clinton asked  it herself during a rally in New York after voting concluded.   'I understand that a lot of people are asking, 'What does  Hillary want?'' she said.      'Now the question is: Where do we go from here? Given how  far we've come and where we need to go as a party, it's a  question I don't take lightly. This has been a long campaign,  and I will be making no decisions tonight,' the New York  senator and former first lady said.      Here are some possible reasons why the former front-runner  is delaying a final decision to end her presidential bid.           * After 17 months of campaigning, Clinton is exhausted and  could simply need a few days to adjust to the idea that the race  is over.      * Clinton told New York lawmakers in a conference call on  Tuesday she is open to the idea of being Obama's running mate in  the November presidential election. If she really wants the job,  her political clout is greater if she keeps her bid alive.      * Clinton attracted more than 17 million votes in the  lengthy nominating race, and Obama needs her supporters if he  has any hope of beating Republican John McCain. Clinton may  want to keep the pressure on Obama to pay respect to her  campaign and accommodate her supporters.      * Clinton, whose campaign is more than $20 million in debt,  may need a few more days to look for ways to pay off her  campaign debts, including the more than $11 million she has  given the campaign from her own pocket.      * She could be looking for the most graceful way to bow out  and protect her legacy and that of her husband, former President  Bill Clinton. His image in particular has been tarnished by the  difficult campaign, particularly in the black community, which  backed Obama heavily.

Richardson, who served as energy secretary and ambassador under  President Bill Clinton, said he was still loyal to the  Clintons.           * Hillary Clinton is known to be fiercely loyal to her own  staff, many of whom have been with her since her time as first  lady in a group affectionately referred to as 'Hillaryland.'           * Clinton retained campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle until  early February when a string of primary losses to Obama  prompted a change to Maggie Williams, another loyalist, who was  a top aide to Clinton as first lady.           * Clinton is wooing so-called superdelegates, party leaders  and other officials, to help her beat Obama for the nomination,  but the Illinois senator has announced more of those  endorsements than she since the Feb. 5 'Super Tuesday'  nominating contests across the country.           * Analysts say loyalty plays a big role in U.S. politics.

The woman nominated to succeed her as top U.S. diplomat:  Sen. Hillary Clinton.      Clinton was invited to have dinner with Rice at Rice's  apartment in Washington's exclusive Watergate complex, a State  Department official said.      Earlier on Monday Clinton made her first visit to the State  Department since Democratic President-elect Barack Obama named  her as his choice for the next secretary of state, the official  said.      Clinton spent several hours with members of the  department's transition team, who had prepared a number of  briefing books for her.      Rice has said Obama's choice of Clinton for the post was  'terrific.' If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Clinton will be  the third woman to be secretary of state, after Rice and  Madeleine Albright, who was appointed by Hillary Clinton's  husband, former President Bill Clinton, in the 1990s.      Susan Rice, Obama's nominee to be U.S. ambassador to the  United Nations, also visited the State Department on Monday and  saw the transition team.

      "Text": "    By Thomas Ferraro      WASHINGTON, June 5 (Reuters) - What does Hillary Clinton  want and what will she get -- other than, perhaps, returning to  the U.S. Senate where she's a bona fide star?      The answer may emerge soon as the failed Democratic  presidential contender gets ready to finally concede defeat --  amid signals she might like to be the vice presidential running  mate of presumptive White House nominee Barack Obama.      'The clock is ticking,' said Paul Light of New York  University's Center for the Study of Congress. He said she must  quickly end her presidential campaign or face party backlash.      'But if she withdraws gracefully, she will have an enormous  range of opportunities,' Light said. 'She could eventually  become a Senate leader or end up on the Supreme Court.'      Others have suggested she might want to be New York  governor -- or make another run for the White House in 2012 if  Republican John McCain defeats Obama in the general election.      Clinton riled some Democrats by declining to concede when  the Illinois senator wrapped up the nomination on Tuesday  night. She has since announced she will do so on Saturday.      Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who backed  Clinton's bid to become the first woman president, said, 'I  have no doubt that if she comes back to the Senate -- as  opposed to becoming the vice presidential nominee or whatever  -- she will continue to be a tremendous senator.'      'And that's not too shabby,' Feinstein said.      Clinton, who joined the Senate in January 2001 after eight  years in the White House as a top aide and wife of President  Bill Clinton.      Some have suggested Clinton follow the lead of Sen. Edward  Kennedy of Massachusetts, a Democratic icon and workhorse.      After he failed to wrest the Democratic nomination from  President Jimmy Carter in 1980, Kennedy returned to the Senate  and became one of its most effective legislators, helping craft  landmark bills, many to help the disadvantaged.      'I've got to believe, as trite as it may sound, that her  role model now is Ted Kennedy,' said Norm Ornstein, a  congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.       The New York Democrat 'could become a real go-to person in  the Senate who has the ability to attract and keep great staff,  who has a real grasp for important issues, who can build  relationships and has a driving desire to figure out how to  make things happen,' he said.      And with the 76-year-old Kennedy being treated for a  malignant brain tumor, Clinton could help fill the void his  illness may leave in the Senate, Ornstein said.           'WHAT DOES HILLARY WANT'      Increased clout -- not a prestigious new title -- is  probably the most Clinton can hope for back in the Senate. At  least for now.      There are no leadership positions open for her to fill, and  after nearly eight years in the Senate, she still lacks the  seniority to chair any major committees.      In her home state Tuesday night, Clinton told supporters:  'A lot of people are asking, 'What does Hillary want?''      'Well, I want what I have always fought for in this whole  campaign. I want to end the war in Iraq. I want to turn this  economy around. I want health care for every American. I want  every child to live up to his or her God-given potential, and I  want the nearly 18 million Americans who voted for me to be  respected, to be heard and no longer to be invisible.'      While Clinton has ",

      "Text": "    By James Vicini      WASHINGTON, Nov 14 Reuters - The U.S. Supreme Court agreed  on Friday to rule on a new challenge to the federal campaign  finance law by a conservative group that wants to broadcast and  promote a movie critical of Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton.      The group, Citizens United, released the 90-minute  documentary film 'Hillary: The Movie' in January when the New  York senator was running for president.      The legal battle over the film is continuing even though  she long ago ended her presidential campaign. Clinton this week  emerged as a candidate for secretary of state or another senior  job in President-elect Barack Obama's administration.      Citizens United released the movie to theaters and for  store sales on DVD. The group also planned to broadcast the  movie on cable television video on-demand, and to pay the fee  for viewers to be able to see the movie.      But that was rejected by a federal court which said under  the campaign finance law the group had to disclose its donors  and include a disclaimer to run its advertisements promoting  the movie.      The federal court also ruled the movie clearly was intended  to influence people to vote against Clinton and thus was  covered by the law's ban on airing ads or 'electioneering  communications' right before an election.      The Justice Department, arguing on behalf of the Federal  Election Commission, urged the court to uphold the lower court  ruling.      Citizens United also prepared a similar critical film about  Obama titled 'Hype: The Obama Effect,' and it also was released  during the campaign.      The campaign finance law at issue in the case was named  after Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the unsuccessful Republican  presidential candidate, and Sen. Russell Feingold, a Democrat  from Wisconsin.      The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case at the  end of February, with a decision expected by the end of June.

      "Text": "  (Adds details, changes dateline from WASHINGTON)      CHICAGO, Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton  declined to say on Friday whether she was in the running to be  secretary of state, a day after a reported meeting with  President-elect Barack Obama in Chicago.      Clinton, wife of former President Bill Clinton, this week  emerged as a candidate for the chief U.S. diplomatic post or  another job in the coming Obama administration.      In introductory remarks at a speech in Albany, New York,  Clinton did not confirm or deny news reports that she had a  secret meeting with Obama on Thursday.      'I'm not going to speculate or address anything about the  president-elect's incoming administration. And I am going to  respect his process and any inquiries should be directed to his  transition team,' Clinton said.      The Obama transition office refused to comment.      Obama defeated Clinton in a sometimes bitter duel for the  Democratic presidential nomination.      Then he picked Sen. Joe Biden as his vice presidential  running mate instead of Clinton, a decision that angered her  ardent supporters and widened a rift in the party that Obama  and Clinton later worked hard to heal.      Considering Clinton for secretary of state would mean Obama  was expanding his search beyond other candidates mentioned for  the job, such as Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, a Democrat who  lost the 2004 presidential election to George W. Bush, and  Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel, a Republican who backed Obama over  Republican John McCain this year.      Obama has been closeted all week in meetings in his  transition office as he prepares to take over the presidency on  Jan. 20.      New Jersey Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine said on MSNBC that  Clinton would be great at the job.      'She probably knows every major foreign leader. There's  already a relationship where she can sit and talk directly  about the problems that exist either on a bilateral or  multilateral basis,' he said.      Corzine would not address speculation that he is a  candidate to be Obama's treasury secretary.

But rival Barack Obama has opened an insurmountable lead in  pledged delegates in their fight for the right to face  Republican John McCain in November's presidential election.      Here are some possible reasons why Clinton, a New York  senator and former first lady, is staying in the race until the  final six contests have been concluded on June 3.      * Given that she is favored in three of the upcoming  contests -- West Virginia, Kentucky and Puerto Rico -- she may  want to continue until all the contests are concluded in order  to feel like she has exhausted her options and explored every  last possible avenue.      * She could be staying in the race to see if Obama makes a  gaffe or becomes embroiled in another controversy that would  rekindle voter concerns about his inexperience and make her  appear to be the stronger candidate. That would let her make  the case to superdelegates that she has the best chance to beat  McCain.      * She could be trying to pressure Obama to add her to the  ticket as his vice presidential nominee. That idea was floated  by a former Clinton aide, ABC News television personality  George Stephanopoulos.      * Clinton, whose campaign ended March in heavy debt and has  since loaned $6.4 million from her own pocket to fund her bid,  could need more time to raise money, pay off her debts and  repay her loans.      * She and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, could  be interested in protecting their legacy and ensuring the duel  ends on a graceful note that would repair her image and revive  their fading reputation in the black community, which has  backed Obama heavily.      * She could be angling for a leadership role in the U.S.  Senate.      * She may want to keep a high-profile role until the August  nominating convention, where she could claim prime-time  exposure.

      "Text": "    By Andrea Hopkins      CINCINNATI, June 19 (Reuters) - Homemaker Mary Mardis, 52,  liked U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton but now she's  not sure who she'll vote for in November. Maybe Barack Obama,  who beat Clinton to win the Democratic nomination. Maybe  Republican John McCain.      'I was leaning toward Hillary. Now I'm undecided,' said  Mardis as she wheeled her baby nephew through a Cincinnati  bookstore. 'I will vote, but I'll probably be one of those  people who decide two days beforehand.'      Since Clinton conceded to rival Obama in the Democratic  race on June 7, there has been endless speculation about the  intentions of her disappointed female supporters.      Would they refuse to support Obama? Not vote in November's  presidential election? Or worse, throw their support to  Republican McCain?      Everywhere, it seems, there are examples of each.      Furious loyalists of the former first lady protested at a  Democratic Party meeting in Washington, vowing to bolt from the  party if Clinton did not win the nomination.      Last week, the co-chairs of the University of Iowa Students  for Hillary told followers they should vote for McCain, or, if  they could not 'stomach' that, consider Cynthia McKinney, the  presumptive Green Party candidate.      On the other hand, prominent feminist and women's rights  organizations, including Emily's List and Planned Parenthood,  have rallied behind Obama and begun attacking McCain for his  conservative record on issues like abortion.      Clinton endorsed Obama and urged her backers to throw their  support behind the Illinois senator.      American women have tended to be more Democratic than  Republican since 1980, though their party loyalty varies  depending on the election year and candidates. This year, too,  polls show most American women prefer Obama to McCain -- by a  wide margin.      An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll last week showed 52 percent  of women favored Obama, while 33 percent preferred McCain.      But the same poll showed 19 percent of voters who cast  ballots for Clinton in the Democratic primaries preferred  McCain over Obama -- a large number considering Clinton and  Obama agree on most policies, while McCain's platform is  strikingly different.           TEMPERS WILL COOL      Lingering intraparty bitterness over the U.S. primary  process is nothing new. McCain denied reports earlier this year  that he did not vote for George W. Bush in 2000 after losing to  him in the Republican primaries that year.      That somehow Clinton's female supporters would be  especially bitter because the New York senator missed her  chance to be the first female U.S. president does not strike  Kristi Andersen, a political science professor at Syracuse  University, as terribly plausible.      'Even if people meant that when they said it right after  Clinton dropped out, as the differences between Obama and  McCain are more clearly drawn, it's pretty hard for me to  imagine that there will be a significant group (switching to  McCain),' said Andersen.      Kay Schlozman, political science professor at Boston  College, agreed. But she said the reason the issue is getting  attention is because even a segment of disaffected Clinton  supporters could have an impact if the election is close.      'If older, Democratic women either vote less Democratic  than they usually do or have the propensity to stay home more  than they usually do, then we can say that's the thing that  ti",

      "Text": " (Updates with Lieberman comments)      By Thomas Ferraro      WASHINGTON, June 5 (Reuters) - What does Hillary Clinton  want and what will she get -- other than, perhaps, returning to  the U.S. Senate where she's still a star?      The answer may emerge soon as Clinton gets ready to finally  concede defeat as the first viable woman contender for the  White House -- amid signs she may like to be the vice  presidential running mate of Democratic presidential candidate  Barack Obama.      Paul Light of New York University's Center for the Study of  Congress said Clinton must quickly end her historic  presidential bid or face party backlash.      'But if she withdraws gracefully, she will have an enormous  range of opportunities,' Light said. 'She could eventually  become a Senate leader or end up on the Supreme Court.'      Others have suggested she might want to be New York  governor -- or make another run for the White House in 2012 if  Republican John McCain defeats Obama in the general election.      Clinton riled some Democrats by declining to concede when  the Illinois senator wrapped up the nomination on Tuesday. She  has since announced she will do so on Saturday.      Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who backed  Clinton, said, 'I have no doubt that if she comes back to the  Senate -- as opposed to becoming the vice presidential nominee  or whatever -- she will continue to be a tremendous senator.'      'And that's not too shabby,' Feinstein said.      Clinton joined the Senate in January 2001 after eight years  in the White House as a top aide and wife of President Bill  Clinton.      Some have suggested Clinton, 60, follow the lead of Sen.  Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, a Democratic icon and  workhorse.      After he failed to wrest the Democratic nomination from  President Jimmy Carter in 1980, Kennedy returned to the Senate  and became one of its most effective legislators, helping craft  landmark bills, many to help the disadvantaged.      'I've got to believe, as trite as it may sound, that her  role model now is Ted Kennedy,' said Norm Ornstein, a  congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.      The New York Democrat 'could become a real go-to person in  the Senate who has the ability to attract and keep great staff,  who has a real grasp for important issues, who can build  relationships and has a driving desire to figure out how to  make things happen,' he said.      And with the 76-year-old Kennedy being treated for brain  cancer, Clinton could help fill the void his illness may create  in the Senate, Ornstein said.           'WHAT DOES HILLARY WANT'      Increased clout -- not a prestigious title -- is probably  the most Clinton can hope for back in the Senate.      There are no leadership positions open for her to fill, and  she lacks the seniority needed to chair any major committee.      In her home state on Tuesday night, Clinton told  supporters: 'A lot of people are asking, 'What does Hillary  want?'      'Well, I want what I have always fought for in this whole  campaign. I want to end the war in Iraq. I want to turn this  economy around. I want health care for every American. I want  every child to live up to his or her God-given potential, and I  want the nearly 18 million Americans who voted for me to be  respected, to be heard and no longer to be invisible.'      While Clinton backers have said she's open to being the  vice presidential nominee if it helps unite the party,  ",

      "Text": "    By Jeff Mason      SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va., May 7 (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton  pressed ahead with her come-from-behind presidential bid on  Wednesday, putting a brave face on a slim victory in Indiana  and vowing to fight on until the last Democratic nominating  contest concludes.      The New York senator, whose loss to Illinois Sen. Barack  Obama in North Carolina on Tuesday added to his nearly  insurmountable lead in the race for their party's nomination,  rearranged her schedule to begin campaigning in the next state  she hopes to win.      'It's a new day, it's a new state, it's a new election,'  Clinton told reporters after a rally in West Virginia, which  holds its nominating contest next week.      The Clinton campaign arranged the event hastily, telling  reporters traveling with her from Indianapolis shortly before 3  a.m. on Wednesday that it would take place.      She had been scheduled to remain in Washington, meeting  with superdelegates -- party leaders and elected officials  whose support she needs to overcome Obama's lead -- and holding  an evening fundraiser.      Advisers said Clinton wanted to show her determination to  keep fighting by campaigning on Wednesday, and she used the  opportunity to remind voters she would compete in all of the  remaining contests, which wrap up in early June.      'I'm staying in this race until there's a nominee,' she  said. 'I obviously am going to work as hard as I can to become  that nominee. That is what I've done. That's what I'm  continuing to do.'      Tired staff said Clinton remained 'unflappable' and focused  on winning the nomination.      At times appearing subdued, the former first lady, who  slept about three hours on Tuesday night according to an aide,  ran through her campaign speech before the crowd of students.  She made only brief mention of her proposal to lift a tax on  gasoline this summer without mentioning Obama's opposition.      A sampling of people in the crowd, including Obama  supporters as well as one Republican, said she should stay in  the race.      'I want her to keep fighting until the very end,' said  Maggie Lauria, 58, a retired school teacher and Clinton  supporter.      'I think she has a shot. She's a fighter. I think when the  superdelegates look at the big picture, they may go her way.'      At a news conference, Clinton reiterated her call for a  solution to the disqualified Florida and Michigan votes and  said she had the best chance to beat Republican John McCain in  the November election.      But she did not openly criticize her opponent, and kept the  news conference short in order to return to Washington.      'We're getting on the road again,' she said.

      "Text": " (Updates with Clinton comments)      By Steve Holland,      DENVER, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Defeated Democrat Hillary  Clinton urged her frustrated followers to fall in line behind  Barack Obama on Monday as a party rift threatened to rain on  Obama's nominating parade.      Obama, 47, faces three challenges at a party convention  opening in Denver: unite Democrats, draw a sharp contrast with  Republican rival John McCain and back up soaring oratory with a  policy for leading the country.      Opening day, scheduled to start at 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT),  had an agenda focused on Obama's personal story. His wife  Michelle Obama was due to speak.      A new opinion poll showed how much work lay ahead to rally  Clinton supporters behind him. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp.  poll said the race between Obama and McCain was dead even, each  with 47 percent support.      It said 66 percent of Clinton supporters backed Obama, down  from 75 percent at the end of June. Twenty-seven percent of  them said they would support McCain in the Nov. 4 election, up  from 16 percent in late June.      Clinton appeared before a chanting, sign-waving crowd of  delegates from her home state of New York and spoke of the need  for party unity. 'We are after all Democrats, so it may take a  while,' she said. 'We're not the fall-in-line party. We are  diverse. But make no mistake, we are unified.'      'We are united and we are together and we are determined,'  she said. 'We're going to make sure that we win on Nov. 4. So  let's have a great convention.'           REHEARSAL      Michelle Obama took the stage in the half-empty hall along  with her children and some family members early on Monday to  see the layout of the place ahead of her speech.      The hall's dominant feature is a giant, multi-tiered screen  set behind the speaker that will be used to project party logos  and a film about Obama's life. Each state delegation's seating  space is marked with a vertical banner.      Asked whether the convention would be harmonious, she said:  'Yes, I am sure of that.'      Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs told CNN the choice for voters  was between Obama and McCain, and noted that Clinton was  publicly throwing her support behind the Illinois senator, who  will deliver his acceptance speech on Thursday.      'If we put the choice in front of delegates here and voters  all across this country, who's going to help rebuild this  economy and put your family back to work, who's going keep your  family safe at night, who's going to reduce our dependence on  foreign oil ... The best person to do those things isn't John  McCain, it's Barack Obama,' Gibbs said.      The McCain campaign has sought to take advantage of the  Democratic divide. Senior McCain aide Carly Fiorina said  disgruntled women supporters of Hillary Clinton 'want a leader  whose judgment and experience they can trust.'           'STUNNED,' FIORINA SAYS      Fiorina said many Democratic women were 'stunned' that  Obama praised his vice presidential running mate, Sen. Joe  Biden, as a good debater and campaigner 'when Hillary Clinton  was clearly in the Democratic primaries the woman who, the  person who, gathered the most votes -- 18 million of them --  was a great debater and a great campaigner.'      Some Clinton supporters had wanted Obama to pick her as his  running mate.      Many delegates in Denver were looking to see how far  Clinton, and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, would  rally her supporters ",

Democratic Party chairman Howard Dean pounded a gavel to  open a four-day convention that Democrats say Obama must use to  unite Democrats, draw a sharp contrast with Republican rival  John McCain and back up soaring oratory with a policy for  leading the country.      'Looking out from this podium tonight, I see this diverse  assembly of Democrats as a testament to the strength and unity   of our party and the fruition of our 50-state strategy,' Dean    said.     The day's agenda was focused on outlining Obama's personal  story. His wife, Michelle Obama, was due to give a keynote  address on Monday night.     The son of a black father from Kenya and a white mother  from Kansas, Obama, 47, spent formative years in Hawaii and  Indonesia, worked his way through college and began his  political career as a community organizer in Chicago.      Democrats hoped a tribute to Massachusetts Sen. Edward  Kennedy, a Democratic Party icon battling brain cancer, would  generate party enthusiasm. An aide to Kennedy said the senator  would attend but not speak.      Casting a cloud over the convention was ongoing resentment  from supporters of New York Sen. Clinton, miffed that she lost  the nomination and upset that she was not picked as Obama's  vice presidential running mate. Obama chose veteran Delaware  Sen. Joe Biden, who arrived at the convention on Monday.      Clinton, speaking to sign-waving supporters from her home  state delegation before the convention began, urged party  unity.      'We are after all Democrats, so it may take a while,' she  said. 'We're not the fall-in-line party. We are diverse. But  make no mistake, we are unified,' she said.      Amid reports that former President Bill Clinton was upset  that he was asked to speak about foreign policy on Wednesday  night instead of the U.S. economy, Obama told reporters  traveling with him that he had told Clinton in a phone  conversation last week he could talk about whatever he wanted.      'I said, Mr. President, you can say whatever you like. Bill  Clinton is a unique figure in our politics,' Obama said.      Obama also said in Moline, Illinois, that Hillary Clinton  had been on his vice presidential short list. He played down a  rift with the Clintons.      'I am absolutely convinced that both Hillary Clinton and  Bill Clinton understand the stakes,' he said.      A new opinion poll showed how much work lay ahead to rally  Clinton supporters behind him. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp.  poll said the race between Obama and McCain was even, each with  47 percent support.

      "Text": "    By Steve Holland      WASHINGTON, May 7 (Reuters) - The road just got rockier for  Democrat Hillary Clinton in her battle to win her party's  presidential nomination.      The New York senator and former first lady barely survived  a strong challenge from rival Barack Obama in Indiana and was  routed by him in North Carolina. Obama inched ever closer to  clinching the right to face Republican John McCain in the  November election.      'I take her at her word that she's going to go forward,'  said Democratic strategist Jim Duffy. 'But the math simply  doesn't change. Two plus two still equals four in this race.  You can't change the numbers. The question becomes at what  point is she willing to decide to concede.'      Her defeat in North Carolina was particularly biting  because she has done some of her best campaigning in the last  few weeks and because her politically astute husband, former  President Bill Clinton, had swept small towns across the state  trying to drum up support for his wife.      Clinton portrayed her slender win in Indiana as a  come-from-behind victory although polls had shown her leading  ahead of the vote. Before all the votes were counted, she vowed  'full speed on to the White House.'      But she made some conciliatory noises.      'I can assure you as I have said on many occasions, that no  matter what happens, I will work for the nominee of the  Democratic Party ... and I know that Senator Obama feels the  same way,' she said.      Obama's North Carolina victory and strong showing in  Indiana was a sign he had survived the furor over racially  charged rhetoric from his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah  Wright, although race still simmers in the contest.      Voters surveyed in exit polls reported that the Wright  issue was a major factor for them. White working-class voters  went heavily for Clinton, while Obama won overwhelming black  support.           UPHILLL STRUGGLE      The 60-year-old Clinton is left with an uphill task.      She must win the lion's share of nominating delegates from  the remaining contests -- West Virginia on May 13, Kentucky and  Oregon on May 20, Puerto Rico on June 1, and Montana and South  Dakota on June 3.      At the same time, she must convince enough of the  Democrats' 'superdelegates,' those party officials who can vote  for whomever they want, that she is a more electable Democrat  and they should side with her.      That effort was already well under way. Top Clinton adviser  Harold Ickes was quoted as telling Time Magazine's The Page on  Tuesday that questions still remained about Obama.     'We don't know enough about Senator Obama yet. We don't need  an 'October surprise.' And (the chance of) an 'October  surprise' with Hillary is remote,' he said.      Plus, Clinton must convince the Democrats to seat delegates  from Florida and Michigan, whose votes she won earlier in the  race but have not been recognized because the voting contests  were held before national Democratic Party rules allowed.      'I think it's most likely that Obama wins,' said Merle  Black, a political science professor at Emory University in  Atlanta. 'I can't see a way that she wins the nomination  without really tearing up the party.'      Democratic strategist Liz Chadderdon said the close contest  needs to end long before the Democrats' nominating convention  in Denver in August because a convention battle would be  damaging and could help the Republicans.

      "Text": "    By Jeff Mason      NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential  hopeful Hillary Clinton has more money at her disposal for a  general election -- which she may or may not be able to use --  than for the current contests against rival Barack Obama,  records show.      Obama, a senator from Illinois, and Clinton, a senator from  New York, both had record fundraising totals in February. Obama  raised some $55 million and Clinton $35 million.      Both have out-raised John McCain, the presumptive  Republican nominee for the November election to determine who  will succeed President George W. Bush in the White House.      But Clinton has significantly less money available than her  Democratic rival because of higher debt and funds raised that  can only be used if she becomes their party's nominee.      Clinton had some $10.9 million in cash left at the end of  February compared with $31.6 million for Obama, according to an  analysis by the Washington-based Campaign Finance Institute of  the candidates' filings with the Federal Election Commission  late this week.      Clinton had significantly higher debts -- she owed $8.7  million, not including the $5 million she herself lent to her  campaign. Obama had about $625,000 in debt to be paid.      Subtracting the debt from her cash in hand leaves the  former first lady with only $2.2 million for the upcoming  primaries in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, which will be crucial  to her candidacy as she tries to close the gap with Obama, who  has accumulated more of the pledged delegates who determine the  eventual Democratic nominee.      Clinton has $22 million raised that can only be used in the  general election under FEC rules. Obama, who has beaten her in  overall fundraising, has $7 million.      A Clinton spokesman said the campaign debt would be paid  and was not a worry.      'We're going to have the resources that we need to compete  and do well in Pennsylvania and the states after that,'  communications director Howard Wolfson told a conference call  with reporters on Saturday.      'Fundraising continues to be strong.'      Wolfson said the financial support that kept coming in was  a sign that Democrats did not want the Clinton-Obama race to  end, and the campaign pointed out that despite being outspent  by Obama, Clinton won contests in Ohio and Texas this month.      McCain, whose candidacy almost imploded last year when his  campaign nearly ran out of money, has run a bare-bones  operation since then and is now spending much of his time  trying to fill his coffers.      After spending the past week on an overseas trip to the  Middle East and Europe, the Arizona senator will go on a  fundraising spree through a handful of Western states starting  on Monday.

      "Text": "  (Adds quotes; changes dateline from SHEPHERDSTOWN)      By Jeff Mason      WASHINGTON, May 7 (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton pressed ahead  with her long-shot presidential bid on Wednesday, putting a  brave face on a slim victory in Indiana and vowing to fight on  until the last state Democratic primaries are concluded.      The New York senator, whose loss to Illinois Sen. Barack  Obama in North Carolina on Tuesday added to his nearly  insurmountable lead in the race for their party's nomination,  projected a defiant tone at a fundraising event honoring  women.      'I've been counted out more than once. But thanks to all of  you, I've come back,' she told the crowd of mostly women, many  of whom urged her to continue competing.     'I am in this race. I am staying in this race,' she said to  applause. 'Too many people have fought too hard to see a woman  continue in this race.'      Clinton said she planned to send a letter to Obama and  Democratic Party Chairman Howard Dean saying that disqualified  primary elections in Florida and Michigan were a 'civil rights  issue' and 'a voting rights issue.'      The former first lady needs the votes from those two  elections to count in order to close the gap with Obama's big  lead in votes and delegates who determine the party's nominee.      The fundraiser, attended by her daughter, Chelsea, and  mother, Dorothy Rodham, came after a day that included a  hastily arranged stop in West Virginia, which holds its primary  next week.      'It's a new day, it's a new state, it's a new election,'  Clinton said after a rally in Shepherdstown, West Virginia.           DETERMINED      Clinton had been scheduled to spend the whole day in  Washington, meeting with superdelegates -- party leaders and  elected officials whose support she needs to overcome Obama's  lead -- and holding the fundraiser.      But her advisers said she wanted to show her determination  to keep fighting by going out and campaigning. She used the  opportunity to remind voters she would compete in all of the  remaining state election contests, which wrap up in early  June.      'I'm staying in this race until there's a nominee,' she  said. 'I obviously am going to work as hard as I can to become  that nominee.'      Tired campaign staff said Clinton remained 'unflappable'  and was focused on winning her party's nomination to face  Republican John McCain in the November general election.      At times appearing subdued, the former first lady, who  slept about three hours on Tuesday night according to an aide,  ran through her campaign speech before a crowd of students in  Shepardstown.      She made only brief mention of her proposal to suspend a  tax on gasoline this summer.      'I want her to keep fighting until the very end,' said  Maggie Lauria, 58, a retired school teacher and Clinton  supporter who attended the event.      'I think she has a shot. She's a fighter. I think when the  superdelegates look at the big picture, they may go her way.'      At a news conference Clinton said she had the best chance  of beating McCain in the November election, but she did not  openly criticize Obama, and kept the news conference short to  return to Washington.      'We're getting on the road again,' she said.

Bill Richardson endorsed Obama, he  was compared to Judas by Clinton backer James Carville.  Richardson, who served as energy secretary and ambassador under  President Bill Clinton, said he was still loyal to the  Clintons.           * Hillary Clinton is known to be fiercely loyal to her own  staff, many of whom have been with her since her time as first  lady in a group affectionately referred to as 'Hillaryland.'           * Clinton retained campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle until  early February when a string of primary losses to Obama  prompted a change to Maggie Williams, another loyalist, who was  a top aide to Clinton as first lady.           * Clinton is wooing so-called superdelegates, party leaders  and other officials, to help her beat Obama for the nomination,  but the Illinois senator has announced more of those  endorsements than she since the Feb. 5 'Super Tuesday'  nominating contests across the country.           * Analysts say loyalty plays a big role in U.S. politics.  Clinton is relying on backing from women voters to help her win  the nomination, while Obama has won support from black voters  in many state contests.

      "Text": "As you know if you watch us on a regular basis, we are fair to Senator Clinton. We treat her the same way we treat all the other candidates, with a healthy dose of skepticism but an open mind. Looking back on my campaign analysis so far, I've been much tougher on John Edwards than Mrs. Clinton because I believe Mr. Edwards is a charlatan and his campaign of class warfare is foolish.\n\nHillary Clinton is waging a conventional campaign. She has a strong machine, unlimited money, and the heavy odds are she will win the Democratic nomination. But her performance on illegal aliens getting driving credentials has been abysmal.\n\nAfter two weeks, two weeks she now says she would not give driver's licenses to people in the U.S. illegally. But why? Why would Hillary Clinton deny driver's licenses to illegal aliens? The senator will not say.\n\n\"Talking Points\" went to a website. No mention of why no licenses. We contacted her press secretary Felipe Reines. He couldn't tell us why. We called Senator Clinton's main man Howard Wolfson. He would not take the call.\n\nThe truth is nobody knows why Hillary Clinton doesn't want to give illegals driving privileges because she simply doesn't want to tell us. Doesn't want to define the issue.\n\nThat's what bothers me about Senator Clinton. I can't figure out what she believes. Most politicians are shifty. Most change positions to get votes, but there comes a time when specific questions have to be answered.\n\nMillions of Americans will vote for Hillary Clinton no matter what she says. And millions will vote against her no matter what she says. But for those of us who take an independent view, and we will decide the presidential election, the failure to address important issues in a clear way is a huge deficit.\n\nI strongly believe Senator Clinton believes she can become president without ever having to reveal who she really is or what she really thinks. This illegal license deal reinforces my belief.\n\nPinheads and Patriots\n\nAs you may know, the entertainment writers are on strike, and that means no money for them. But our pal David Letterman says he will pay his writers and his entire staff out of his own pocket for the next few weeks. That is very generous. And tonight, David Letterman is a patriot.\n\nOn the pinhead front, in Sydney, Australia, Sari Haggerty, the national Santa coordinator for a company which supplies Santas to department stores and such, has ordered St. Nick not to say, \"Ho, ho, ho\" this season. Apparently, Ms. Haggerty believes some Australian women may be offended by \"ho, ho, ho,\" so Santa must now say, \"Ha, ha, ha.\"\n\nThis is not a joke. This is stupid. So Sari Haggerty is a pinhead. Leave Santa alone, mate.\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads and Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

The woman nominated to succeed her as top U.S. diplomat:  Sen. Hillary Clinton.      Clinton was invited to have dinner with Rice at Rice's  apartment in Washington's exclusive Watergate complex, a State  Department official said.      Earlier on Monday Clinton made her first visit to the State  Department since Democratic President-elect Barack Obama named  her as his choice for the next secretary of state, the official  said.      Clinton spent several hours with members of the  department's transition team, who had prepared a number of  briefing books for her.      Rice has said Obama's choice of Clinton for the post was  'terrific.' If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Clinton will be  the third woman to be secretary of state, after Rice and  Madeleine Albright, who was appointed by Hillary Clinton's  husband, former President Bill Clinton, in the 1990s.      Susan Rice, Obama's nominee to be U.S. ambassador to the  United Nations, also visited the State Department on Monday and  saw the transition team.

      "Text": "    By Carey Gillam      KANSAS CITY, Mo., Feb 4 (Reuters) - Tom Effertz is 73 and a  wheat farmer. Rosie Erganian is 52 and lives in a town on the  Missouri River. He's a Republican. She's a Democrat. Both  Missourians want anyone but Democrat Hillary Clinton for U.S.  president.      'We're tired of the Hillary thing,' Effertz said. 'We'd had  enough of Bill and Hillary.'      'I do not like the way they've been kind of nasty,' said  Erganian, of Rocheport, Missouri. 'I don't want anybody in  office like that.'      Tuesday is 'Super Tuesday' when 24 states, Missouri among  them, hold nominating contests for one or both parties. It is  the biggest date in the six-month process to decide which of  each party will face off in the Nov. 4 election to succeed  President George W. Bush.       When it comes to the November election, Missouri, home to  the plain-speaking late President Harry Truman in the heart of  America, has long been viewed as a bellwether, having voted for  the winner in every presidential ballot except one since 1904.      The former first lady is virtually tied with Illinois Sen.  Barack Obama among Democrats in Missouri, according to a  Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll released on Sunday. Super Tuesday  could be a tight race nationwide for the two Democrats.      On the Republican side Sen. John McCain leads former  Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in most states, but not in  the big-prize state of California.      Strong anti-Clinton feeling has people in both parties  speculating that if the New York senator wins the Democratic  nomination she could become a powerful unifying force -- for  Republicans.           'VETTED, TESTED'      The Clintons have been on the national political stage  since Bill Clinton won the presidency in 1992. Once his second  term ended in 2001, Hillary Clinton began her own, official,  political career by winning a Senate seat from New York.      'I've been taking the incoming fire from Republicans for  about 16 years now, and I'm still here, because I have been  vetted, I have been tested,' she said on Sunday on ABC's 'This  Week.'      Obama's supporters and Republican leaders alike say  although many voters passionately support Clinton, at least as  many passionately dislike her. They offer various explanations  and acknowledge that at least some are unfair.      Some anger at her is residual resentment of her husband  whose second term was mired in a long impeachment process  stemming from an extramarital relationship.  For some it's  about her policies -- pro-gun control, for universal health  care.       Others cite a personality they see as too aggressive and  insincere.      Clinton's campaign has brushed aside the concerns, saying  she has a proven track record of winning, in her New York  campaigns and in voting last month in New Hampshire and Nevada.  Obama won in Iowa and South Carolina.      'I can go up against Senator McCain or any of the  Republicans and be able to defend our positions, put them  forward to the American people and make an affirmative case as  to why I should be the president,' Clinton said on ABC.      'Her record of reaching out across the aisle to find common  solutions is the reason ... she has such a strong record of  getting results,' said Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee,  insisting that Clinton had growing support among Republicans  and independent voters.           'HIGH NEGATIVES'      Concerns among Democrats about how Clinton might energize  Republicans",

Following are key quotes from Clinton at a news conference  with South Korea's Foreign Minister:            ON NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA      'The Republic of Korea's achievement of democracy and  prosperity stands in stark contrast to the tyranny and poverty  across the border to the North.'      'North Korea is not going to get a different relationship  with the United States while insulting and refusing dialogue with  the Republic of Korea.'

ON SIX-PARTY TALKS      '(We will) try to convince the North Koreans to begin a  process within the six-party talks toward the complete and  verifiable elimination of nuclear weapons.'      '... we deal with the government in place right now, and that  government is being asked to re-engage in the six-party talks.'

      "Text": "    June 4 (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton lost a historic and  grueling race for the Democratic presidential nomination to  Barack Obama on Tuesday but refused to concede, raising  questions about what she wants next.      The question was so prevalent, in fact, that Clinton asked  it herself during a rally in New York after voting concluded.   'I understand that a lot of people are asking, 'What does  Hillary want?'' she said.      'Now the question is: Where do we go from here? Given how  far we've come and where we need to go as a party, it's a  question I don't take lightly. This has been a long campaign,  and I will be making no decisions tonight,' the New York  senator and former first lady said.      Here are some possible reasons why the former front-runner  is delaying a final decision to end her presidential bid.           * After 17 months of campaigning, Clinton is exhausted and  could simply need a few days to adjust to the idea that the race  is over.      * Clinton told New York lawmakers in a conference call on  Tuesday she is open to the idea of being Obama's running mate in  the November presidential election. If she really wants the job,  her political clout is greater if she keeps her bid alive.      * Clinton attracted more than 17 million votes in the  lengthy nominating race, and Obama needs her supporters if he  has any hope of beating Republican John McCain. Clinton may  want to keep the pressure on Obama to pay respect to her  campaign and accommodate her supporters.      * Clinton, whose campaign is more than $20 million in debt,  may need a few more days to look for ways to pay off her  campaign debts, including the more than $11 million she has  given the campaign from her own pocket.      * She could be looking for the most graceful way to bow out  and protect her legacy and that of her husband, former President  Bill Clinton. His image in particular has been tarnished by the  difficult campaign, particularly in the black community, which  backed Obama heavily.

      "Text": "    By Thomas Ferraro      WASHINGTON, June 5 (Reuters) - What does Hillary Clinton  want and what will she get -- other than, perhaps, returning to  the U.S. Senate where she's a bona fide star?      The answer may emerge soon as the failed Democratic  presidential contender gets ready to finally concede defeat --  amid signals she might like to be the vice presidential running  mate of presumptive White House nominee Barack Obama.      'The clock is ticking,' said Paul Light of New York  University's Center for the Study of Congress. He said she must  quickly end her presidential campaign or face party backlash.      'But if she withdraws gracefully, she will have an enormous  range of opportunities,' Light said. 'She could eventually  become a Senate leader or end up on the Supreme Court.'      Others have suggested she might want to be New York  governor -- or make another run for the White House in 2012 if  Republican John McCain defeats Obama in the general election.      Clinton riled some Democrats by declining to concede when  the Illinois senator wrapped up the nomination on Tuesday  night. She has since announced she will do so on Saturday.      Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who backed  Clinton's bid to become the first woman president, said, 'I  have no doubt that if she comes back to the Senate -- as  opposed to becoming the vice presidential nominee or whatever  -- she will continue to be a tremendous senator.'      'And that's not too shabby,' Feinstein said.      Clinton, who joined the Senate in January 2001 after eight  years in the White House as a top aide and wife of President  Bill Clinton.      Some have suggested Clinton follow the lead of Sen. Edward  Kennedy of Massachusetts, a Democratic icon and workhorse.      After he failed to wrest the Democratic nomination from  President Jimmy Carter in 1980, Kennedy returned to the Senate  and became one of its most effective legislators, helping craft  landmark bills, many to help the disadvantaged.      'I've got to believe, as trite as it may sound, that her  role model now is Ted Kennedy,' said Norm Ornstein, a  congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.       The New York Democrat 'could become a real go-to person in  the Senate who has the ability to attract and keep great staff,  who has a real grasp for important issues, who can build  relationships and has a driving desire to figure out how to  make things happen,' he said.      And with the 76-year-old Kennedy being treated for a  malignant brain tumor, Clinton could help fill the void his  illness may leave in the Senate, Ornstein said.           'WHAT DOES HILLARY WANT'      Increased clout -- not a prestigious new title -- is  probably the most Clinton can hope for back in the Senate. At  least for now.      There are no leadership positions open for her to fill, and  after nearly eight years in the Senate, she still lacks the  seniority to chair any major committees.      In her home state Tuesday night, Clinton told supporters:  'A lot of people are asking, 'What does Hillary want?''      'Well, I want what I have always fought for in this whole  campaign. I want to end the war in Iraq. I want to turn this  economy around. I want health care for every American. I want  every child to live up to his or her God-given potential, and I  want the nearly 18 million Americans who voted for me to be  respected, to be heard and no longer to be invisible.'      While Clinton has ",

      "Text": "    Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York is  expected to get a warm welcome on Tuesday when she visits the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee for a hearing on her  nomination to be U.S. Secretary of State.      Clinton, a Democrat who has at times been a polarizing  figure during her political career, has faced no opposition so  far from Senate colleagues to her nomination by President-elect  Barack Obama to be the top U.S. diplomat.      Here are some facts and biographical details about  Clinton.           - Clinton, who is married to former President Bill Clinton,  was first lady from 1993 to 2001. She headed the Clinton  administration's failed effort to overhaul the U.S. health care  system and drew criticism for not seeking enough public or  congressional input and developing a plan that was considered  too complicated.           - While in the White House she was drawn into several  scandal investigations, but was never charged with wrongdoing  in probes of the firing of White House travel office staff  members and an Arkansas real estate loan made before the couple  moved to the White House.           - Clinton defended her husband when allegations surfaced in  1998 of his extramarital affair with a White House intern and  was angry when they were revealed to be true, but stood by him  during his impeachment and subsequent acquittal in a Senate  trial.           - Clinton was elected to the U.S. Senate from New York in  2000, the first time a first lady had run for public office.  While Clinton has been a frequent target of Republican  animosity, she won praise for building bridges with the other  party in the Senate, visited conservative areas of upstate New  York frequently and was easily re-elected in 2006 in a race  that set up her run for the White House in 2008.           - Clinton won more than 18 million votes during a prolonged  and close battle with Obama for the Democratic presidential  nomination, but eventually fell short and withdrew from the  race in June 2008. She pledged her support for Obama in his  campaign against Republican John McCain, delivering a  high-profile convention speech on Obama's behalf and appearing  on the campaign trail with him frequently.           - Clinton, a graduate of Yale Law School, was an  accomplished lawyer. She worked in Washington in 1974 for the  House of Representatives committee considering the impeachment  of President Richard Nixon during Watergate and was named by a  magazine in 1991 as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in  America.           - Clinton, 61, was born in Park Ridge, Illinois. She was a  fan of conservative Republican presidential candidate Barry  Goldwater during his losing 1964 campaign, but became a  Democrat while attending Wellesley College. She met Bill  Clinton while at Yale.   (Writing by John Whitesides; Editing by David Storey) ((john.whitesides@reuters.com; 202 898-8393))  Keywords: USA CLINTON/        ",

      "Text": "    By Sue Pleming      WASHINGTON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Israel's attacks on Gaza  could test Hillary Clinton's mettle as the next top U.S.  diplomat mediating between Israelis and Palestinians.      As incoming President Barack Obama's secretary of state,  she will have to overcome a view of some in the Arab world she  is more interested in supporting Israel than being  even-handed.      Once she stops being a U.S. senator from New York to take  her new job, Clinton could find herself pursuing the same  Middle East peace that eluded her husband, former President  Bill Clinton, in the final months of his presidency in 2000.      University of Maryland professor Shibley Telhami said  opinion polls he conducted earlier this year in Arab countries  indicated Clinton was viewed as someone who, like her husband,  would work to advance Middle East peace.      'Bill Clinton had a much more positive image in the Middle  East (than George W. Bush) and Hillary is seen in a similar  light,' he said, adding that her past support for Israel would  not necessarily count against her.      But even if Clinton were ready to take on the role of peace  broker early on, the upsurge in violence and Israeli and  Palestinian elections expected over the next two months, would  likely delay meaningful discussions.      'There is too much blood spilled for this to end quickly.'  said Telhami.      Aaron Miller, who advised six secretaries of state in  Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, said Clinton was respected in  the region and disputed that she was viewed as pro-Israeli.      He said Clinton's personal and political battles as a  former U.S. presidential candidate, made her tough and  resilient -- desirable attributes in Middle East diplomacy.      More important than her prowess as a mediator will be how  high a priority Obama makes the Israeli-Palestinian issue among  the many challenges facing his new administration.      'She will have to do the heavy lifting but she must be  empowered and backed up and supported by the president,' said  Miller, who is now at the Woodrow Wilson International Center  for Scholars in Washington.           NOT YET TESTED      Clinton, who lost the Democratic presidential nomination to  Obama, needs to maintain a strong relationship with the new  president to be effective, he added.      While well-versed in foreign affairs, Clinton has yet to be  tested in a crisis, such as the Israeli offensive against Gaza  to suppress Palestinian rocket fire against its citizens.     'She (Clinton) does not have a lot of experience in the  Byzantine negotiations in the Arab world,' said Jeffrey White,  of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.      The Bush administration has so far backed Israel's actions  in Gaza and demanded the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas stop  firing rockets into Israel and agree to a lasting cease-fire.      Edward Walker, former U.S. ambassador to Israel and Egypt,  said Clinton should go the region early. Her confirmation  hearings are expected in mid-January and she could take office  immediately after Obama's Jan. 20 inauguration.      'What the administration needs to do is to say that we  consider Israeli-Palestinian peace a priority but that we  cannot force the parties into an agreement unless they are  prepared for an agreement,' Walker said.      Outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who has  spoken to Clinton since the latest violence erupted, made  Israeli-Palestinian peace a prio",

Speaking to reporters in Washington on Friday, Solana said  he had known Clinton and her husband, former President Bill  Clinton, for a long time and the New York senator would be well  received in Europe if she became the top U.S. diplomat.      'I think it would be very well taken if that is the case,  at the end of the day,' said Solana when asked how he thought  European diplomats would react if President-elect Barack Obama  chose her to head the State Department.     'She is capable, with experience. She is well known,' he  added. 'Nothing seems to be negative.'      A Democratic Party official said on Thursday that Obama was  on track to name Clinton as secretary of state after the Nov.  27 Thanksgiving holiday.      Solana said Clinton's husband was respected for his efforts  in trying to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the  final days of his administration.      'The name Clinton is well regarded,' added Solana, who has  had several key European diplomatic jobs, including NATO  Secretary General until 1999.      Solana said he had not spoken to either Clinton during his  current U.S. visit but that he had recently been in contact  with Vice President-elect Joe Biden, who as a long-time member  of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and its current  chairman, is also well-known in foreign policy circles.

      "Text": " (Updates with Lieberman comments)      By Thomas Ferraro      WASHINGTON, June 5 (Reuters) - What does Hillary Clinton  want and what will she get -- other than, perhaps, returning to  the U.S. Senate where she's still a star?      The answer may emerge soon as Clinton gets ready to finally  concede defeat as the first viable woman contender for the  White House -- amid signs she may like to be the vice  presidential running mate of Democratic presidential candidate  Barack Obama.      Paul Light of New York University's Center for the Study of  Congress said Clinton must quickly end her historic  presidential bid or face party backlash.      'But if she withdraws gracefully, she will have an enormous  range of opportunities,' Light said. 'She could eventually  become a Senate leader or end up on the Supreme Court.'      Others have suggested she might want to be New York  governor -- or make another run for the White House in 2012 if  Republican John McCain defeats Obama in the general election.      Clinton riled some Democrats by declining to concede when  the Illinois senator wrapped up the nomination on Tuesday. She  has since announced she will do so on Saturday.      Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who backed  Clinton, said, 'I have no doubt that if she comes back to the  Senate -- as opposed to becoming the vice presidential nominee  or whatever -- she will continue to be a tremendous senator.'      'And that's not too shabby,' Feinstein said.      Clinton joined the Senate in January 2001 after eight years  in the White House as a top aide and wife of President Bill  Clinton.      Some have suggested Clinton, 60, follow the lead of Sen.  Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, a Democratic icon and  workhorse.      After he failed to wrest the Democratic nomination from  President Jimmy Carter in 1980, Kennedy returned to the Senate  and became one of its most effective legislators, helping craft  landmark bills, many to help the disadvantaged.      'I've got to believe, as trite as it may sound, that her  role model now is Ted Kennedy,' said Norm Ornstein, a  congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.      The New York Democrat 'could become a real go-to person in  the Senate who has the ability to attract and keep great staff,  who has a real grasp for important issues, who can build  relationships and has a driving desire to figure out how to  make things happen,' he said.      And with the 76-year-old Kennedy being treated for brain  cancer, Clinton could help fill the void his illness may create  in the Senate, Ornstein said.           'WHAT DOES HILLARY WANT'      Increased clout -- not a prestigious title -- is probably  the most Clinton can hope for back in the Senate.      There are no leadership positions open for her to fill, and  she lacks the seniority needed to chair any major committee.      In her home state on Tuesday night, Clinton told  supporters: 'A lot of people are asking, 'What does Hillary  want?'      'Well, I want what I have always fought for in this whole  campaign. I want to end the war in Iraq. I want to turn this  economy around. I want health care for every American. I want  every child to live up to his or her God-given potential, and I  want the nearly 18 million Americans who voted for me to be  respected, to be heard and no longer to be invisible.'      While Clinton backers have said she's open to being the  vice presidential nominee if it helps unite the party,  ",

      "Text": " (Repeating without changes to text or headline)      Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York is  expected to get a warm welcome on Tuesday when she visits the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee for a hearing on her  nomination to be U.S. Secretary of State.      Clinton, a Democrat who has at times been a polarizing  figure during her political career, has faced no opposition so  far from Senate colleagues to her nomination by President-elect  Barack Obama to be the top U.S. diplomat.      Here are some facts and biographical details about  Clinton.           - Clinton, who is married to former President Bill Clinton,  was first lady from 1993 to 2001. She headed the Clinton  administration's failed effort to overhaul the U.S. health care  system and drew criticism for not seeking enough public or  congressional input and developing a plan that was considered  too complicated.           - While in the White House she was drawn into several  scandal investigations, but was never charged with wrongdoing  in probes of the firing of White House travel office staff  members and an Arkansas real estate loan made before the couple  moved to the White House.           - Clinton defended her husband when allegations surfaced in  1998 of his extramarital affair with a White House intern and  was angry when they were revealed to be true, but stood by him  during his impeachment and subsequent acquittal in a Senate  trial.           - Clinton was elected to the U.S. Senate from New York in  2000, the first time a first lady had run for public office.  While Clinton has been a frequent target of Republican  animosity, she won praise for building bridges with the other  party in the Senate, visited conservative areas of upstate New  York frequently and was easily re-elected in 2006 in a race  that set up her run for the White House in 2008.           - Clinton won more than 18 million votes during a prolonged  and close battle with Obama for the Democratic presidential  nomination, but eventually fell short and withdrew from the  race in June 2008. She pledged her support for Obama in his  campaign against Republican John McCain, delivering a  high-profile convention speech on Obama's behalf and appearing  on the campaign trail with him frequently.           - Clinton, a graduate of Yale Law School, was an  accomplished lawyer. She worked in Washington in 1974 for the  House of Representatives committee considering the impeachment  of President Richard Nixon during Watergate and was named by a  magazine in 1991 as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in  America.           - Clinton, 61, was born in Park Ridge, Illinois. She was a  fan of conservative Republican presidential candidate Barry  Goldwater during his losing 1964 campaign, but became a  Democrat while attending Wellesley College. She met Bill  Clinton while at Yale.   (Writing by John Whitesides; Editing by David Storey)  ((john.whitesides@reuters.com; 202 898-8393))  Keywords: USA CLINTON/        ",

      "Text": "    * Democratic National Convention opens      * Edward Kennedy to be honored      * Vice presidential pick Biden arrives in convention city           By Steve Holland,      DENVER, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Defeated Democratic presidential  hopeful Hillary Clinton urged her frustrated followers to fall  in line behind Barack Obama on Monday as a party rift  threatened to rain on Obama's nominating parade.      Democratic Party chairman Howard Dean pounded a gavel to  open a four-day convention that Democrats say Obama must use to  unite Democrats, draw a sharp contrast with Republican rival  John McCain and back up soaring oratory with a policy for  leading the country.      'Looking out from this podium tonight, I see this diverse  assembly of Democrats as a testament to the strength and unity   of our party and the fruition of our 50-state strategy,' Dean    said.     The day's agenda was focused on outlining Obama's personal  story. His wife, Michelle Obama, was due to give a keynote  address on Monday night.     The son of a black father from Kenya and a white mother  from Kansas, Obama, 47, spent formative years in Hawaii and  Indonesia, worked his way through college and began his  political career as a community organizer in Chicago.      Democrats hoped a tribute to Massachusetts Sen. Edward  Kennedy, a Democratic Party icon battling brain cancer, would  generate party enthusiasm. An aide to Kennedy said the senator  would attend but not speak.      Casting a cloud over the convention was ongoing resentment  from supporters of New York Sen. Clinton, miffed that she lost  the nomination and upset that she was not picked as Obama's  vice presidential running mate. Obama chose veteran Delaware  Sen. Joe Biden, who arrived at the convention on Monday.      Clinton, speaking to sign-waving supporters from her home  state delegation before the convention began, urged party  unity.      'We are after all Democrats, so it may take a while,' she  said. 'We're not the fall-in-line party. We are diverse. But  make no mistake, we are unified,' she said.      Amid reports that former President Bill Clinton was upset  that he was asked to speak about foreign policy on Wednesday  night instead of the U.S. economy, Obama told reporters  traveling with him that he had told Clinton in a phone  conversation last week he could talk about whatever he wanted.      'I said, Mr. President, you can say whatever you like. Bill  Clinton is a unique figure in our politics,' Obama said.      Obama also said in Moline, Illinois, that Hillary Clinton  had been on his vice presidential short list. He played down a  rift with the Clintons.      'I am absolutely convinced that both Hillary Clinton and  Bill Clinton understand the stakes,' he said.      A new opinion poll showed how much work lay ahead to rally  Clinton supporters behind him. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp.  poll said the race between Obama and McCain was even, each with  47 percent support.      It said 66 percent of Clinton supporters backed Obama, down  from 75 percent at the end of June. Twenty-seven percent of  them said they would support McCain in the Nov. 4 election, up  from 16 percent in late June.           REHEARSAL      Michelle Obama took the stage in the half-empty hall along  with her children and some family members early on Monday to  check the layout ahead of her speech.      The hall's dominant feature is a giant, multi-tiered screen  set behind the speaker that will project party l",

      "Text": "This is part three of a five-part series looking at how illegal immigration affects U.S. border security, the criminal, health care and education systems, as well as the economy. Watch the series this week on FOX News Channel.\n\nOverburdened by the uninsured and overwhelmed by illegal immigration (search), public health care in Los Angeles is on life support.\n\nSixty percent of the county's uninsured patients are not U.S. citizens. More than half are here illegally. About 2 million undocumented aliens in Los Angeles County alone are crowding emergency rooms because they can't afford to see a doctor.\n\nAccording to the State Association of Hospitals (search), California's public health system is \"on the brink of collapse.\" In Los Angeles County, patients can wait four days for a hospital bed and up to two years for gallbladder surgery.\n\n\"The hospitals are closing because of the totality of the uninsured,\" said Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, director of the Los Angeles County Health Department (search). \"If you're legally a resident in California and you're poor, you have a right to basic services.\"\n\nBut some critics say the taxpayers can't be the HMO (search) to the world. Last year, Los Angeles County spent $340 million to treat the uninsured; that's roughly $1,000 for every taxpayer.\n\n\"We're citizens here. Why should somebody from another country that's here illegally get anything that we can't get? I mean that's dumb, that's not right,\" said Don Schenck, whose son, Bill, is mentally disabled.\n\nThough the Schencks are uninsured, and considered poor by county standards, his father had to find a way to pay for his Bill's care while thousands of others, in the country illegally, get it for free.\n\n\"It makes you feel pretty bad when you're born in that country and you're handicapped and you've got a learning disability and you can't get medical,\" Schenck said.\n\nMike Antonovich, the Los Angeles County supervisor, said the system has been \"basically bankrupted.\"\n\nThe Department of Health has a $1.2 billion deficit. Caring for illegals is siphoning money from other services and forcing clinics, trauma centers and emergency rooms to close, he said.\n\n\"We cannot afford to have a open-door policy to encourage illegals to continue to come here and receive all the medical care, because it's too expensive,\" he said.\n\nImmigrants like Yolanda Hernandez, however, argue that if there were cheap insurance plans available to her community, people would buy them.\n\n\"[Americans] have enough money to pay for insurance,\" she said. \"They make good money and are educated. Unfortunately, we are not.\"\n\nThe fourth installment of this series focuses on how border states are dealing with educating Mexican immigrants and the strain it's putting on California's education system. Look for it on FOX News and FOX News.com.\n\nClick on the video box above for a complete report by FOX News' William LaJeunesse.",

A total of 13,424 illegal immigrants arrived last year, most  of them arriving on the Canary Islands, down from a peak of  39,180 in 2006, Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said.      'The policies we have put in place to avoid the departure of  immigrants from their countries is gradually producing results,'  Rubalcaba told a news conference.       Spain has offered more aid to west African countries, where  most illegal immigrants to Spain come from. It has also beefed  up cooperation with local police forces and persuaded several  developing nations to accept the return of illegal immigrants.      Every year thousands of Africans sailing in overcrowded,  wooden boats try to reach Europe via Spain in search of jobs and  a better life. Scores have died in the attempt.      The ministry said the number of illegal immigrants who were  repatriated to their countries of origin from Spain fell by 17  percent to 46,426 people, compared with the previous year.      Rubalcaba said he doubted Spain's economic crisis was  dissuading Africans from trying to reach its shores.      'My impression is that the situation is so bad in Africa it  has very little effect.'      Spain's Socialist government was heavily criticised in 2005  for granting a three-month amnesty to about 700,000 illegal  immigrants already living in the country. Other EU countries and  the conservative opposition said the move would encourage  illegal immigration.

The earthquake, which was measured at magnitude 5.8, was  centered about 30 miles (48 km) east of Los Angeles near the  community of Chino Hills, where it was felt strongly.      Witnesses reported feeling the shaking strongly in  neighboring Orange County and as far south as San Diego.      The Los Angeles Fire Department said there were no injuries  reported.      In downtown Los Angeles, tall buildings swayed from side to  side for a few seconds and workers poured into the streets.      Los Angeles city officials evacuated City Hall.      People returned to many buildings after some 15 minutes.      A spokesman for Los Angeles International Airport said  there were no flight delays as a result of the quake.

      "Text": "    ROME, July 31 (Reuters) - About 800 illegal immigrants  landed in Southern Italy on Thursday, with emergency services  warning that already crowded holding centres are near collapse  in a country that has declared an immigration emergency.      Early on Thursday about 400 immigrants on a 17-metre  (55-foot) boat, which was listing dangerously, were guided by  Italian coastguard officers into the port of Lampedusa, a small  island south of the Italian mainland.      Four smaller boats were later intercepted at sea off the  island and 400 more immigrants were brought into port by  coastguards.      Most of the arrivals, who included women and children,  appeared to be of African origin. Many were not wearing shoes as  they had been told to remove them on boarding the boats before  departure, most probably on the Libyan coast.      The local holding centre in Lampedusa is already housing  some 700 illegal immigrants who arrived in the last few days and  is close to its capacity of 1,500 people.      Italy's centre-right government is cracking down on illegal  immigration, with tough new laws aimed at making it easier to  expel them and imposing tougher sentences on those committing  crimes. Last Friday it declared a state of emergency over the  influx of immigrants arriving on Italy's long shoreline.

      "Text": "    (The following statement was released by the ratings agency)      Feb 19 - Moody's Investors Service has assigned an initial underlying A2  rating to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's (LACMA) outstanding $176.2  million Series 2004 A, B, and C and $200 million Series 2007 A, B, C, and D  Revenue Bonds. The outlook is stable. The bonds are also insured by FGIC, whose  current financial strength rating is A3-on watch for possible downgrade.      LEGAL SECURITY: The bonds are an unconditional general and unsecured  obligation of the Museum. LACMA covenants to maintain 0.95 times adjusted  unrestricted net assets relative to debt beginning June 30, 2008 and there is  an additional bonds test that requires adjusted unrestricted net assets to  equal 0.95 times existing and proposed debt. As of December 31, 2007, the  adjusted unrestricted net assets to debt ratio was approximately 1.2 times.      INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES: LACMA has five interest rate swap agreements  outstanding, with Citibank acting as the counterparty, in order to hedge its  interest rate exposure on a portion of its variable rate debt. All of the  swaps are variable to fixed rate swaps, with LACMA paying a fixed rate and  receiving a percentage of LIBOR. The swaps have a notional amount of $256  million and synthetically fix approximately two-thirds of the Museum's  outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2007, the termination value of the swaps  was a liability of approximately $11.4 million. We believe that the swaps and  LACMA's 100% variable rate debt structure add an element of risk to the  rating, but that it is manageable at the A2 level.      STRENGTHS      *Strongly established relationship with Los Angeles County through a  99-year funding agreement that commenced in 1994. As per the agreement, LACMA  receives annual support from the County in the form of direct cash and in-kind  payments. In FY 2007, the direct cash payments from the County totaled $14.0  million. The County has also provided $15 million of unrestricted  extraordinary support to LACMA in connection with its fundraising campaign.      *The premier encyclopedic art museum in the Western United States, and one  of the most prominent cultural institutions in Los Angeles, with a collection  of over 150,000 artworks from around the world.      *Growing financial resource base (expendable financial resources of $291.3  million), bolstered by successful fundraising from a generous and high profile  Board of Trustees.      *Currently in the second phase of a capital transformation of its campus;  this will include several new and renovated buildings and exhibition spaces,  parking structures, and park improvements that are intended to position LACMA  to diversify its visitor profile and become more of a tourist destination.      CHALLENGES      *Leveraged balance sheet, with expendable financial resources (net assets  that are available over the medium term) covering pro-forma debt 0.8 times.      *Higher operating costs associated with new buildings may impact LACMA's  operating performance in the near-term, although higher admissions ticket  prices and projected higher attendance and membership levels may offset  increased expenses.      *Construction risk associated with capital projects that are part of Phase  II of LACMA's three phase campus transformation.      *While fundraising has been strong (averaging $53.9 million annually over  the past three years), significant additional funds are n",

      "Text": "    By Robin Emmott      NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico, Jan 15 - Illegal immigrants from  Latin America are heading deeper into the United States to find  work and avoid deportation as crackdowns in border states like  Texas and Arizona make life more difficult for them.      The U.S. Border Patrol has ramped up surveillance along the  porous Mexican border aided by National Guard troops since  2005, while police and state legislatures have increasingly  targeted illegal immigrants in some border states.      'Texas is crawling with Border Patrol agents and the locals  are so tuned in that if they see you walking down the street,  they phone the Border Patrol, who come and deport you,' said Joe  Reyes, 45, who lived for seven years in Houston before being  deported in November.      'I'm heading for North Carolina if I can get back across,'  he said at the Catholic-run migrant shelter in Nuevo Laredo,  across the border from Laredo, Texas.      Washington hired thousands more Border Patrol agents last  year to help deport immigrants who entered illegally or  outstayed their visas, carry out workplace raids, jail illegals  and push police to enforce immigration laws.      While workplace raids are common in central and northern  states, Arizona and Texas are now arguably the toughest places  for undocumented immigrants.      In Arizona, once a popular state for fresh arrivals due to  its desert border with Mexico, companies are laying off  undocumented workers after a new law came into effect on Jan. 1  punishing companies who hire illegal immigrants.      Family networks in border states are still a strong pull  for new immigrants and some are willing to risk living in  Texas, which has a Hispanic heritage and big Hispanic  population.      But migrant shelters and people smugglers are warning  illegal immigrants that they need to go farther north to last  long in the United States.      'Our message to new migrants, and those trying to get back  to the United States after being deported, is that if they  really want to go, avoid California, Arizona, New Mexico and  Texas,' said Eduardo Carrera, a volunteer at a shelter in Nuevo  Laredo, where migrants stop on their way to the United States.           BETTER PAY UP NORTH      For decades, illegal immigrants have crossed the border  into the United States, where an estimated 12 million live and  work in the shadows. Many would traditionally settle in the  four border states, where there are plenty of temporary jobs on  farms, in construction and in the service economy.      But better wages in northern states -- such as Virginia,  Maryland and Washington -- amid a slowing U.S. economy are also  changing that trend.      'There is a growing economic incentive to migrate to  non-traditional destinations. The fact that surveillance may be  less intense in these areas is an added benefit,' said Wayne  Cornelius, an immigration expert at the University of  California, San Diego.      According to a study by Pew Hispanic Center research  institute, some 57 U.S. counties in mainly northern and central  states doubled their population of Hispanics, including both  legal and illegal immigrants, between 2000 and 2006.      'Very few are in the traditional Hispanic areas of the  southwest,' said Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at the center.  'There is a very big concentration in Virginia, mostly in the  Washington D.C. suburbs,' he added.      People smugglers in Tijuana near San Diego say they are  taking m",

      "Text": "    CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Pope Benedict  called on Sunday for an effective political solution to deal  with the human problems of illegal immigration from Africa to  Europe.      The pope, speaking to pilgrims and tourists at his summer  residence south of Rome, said the hopes of illegal migrants  seeking a better life often ended in tragedy on the high seas.      He mentioned an accident last week in which some 70 Africa  migrants went missing and were believed killed in the central  Mediterranean when their rubber boat capsized.      'While it (illegal migration) reaches out for solidarity, at  the same time it also calls for efficient political responses,'  he said.      Each year tens of thousands of migrants from Africa, Asia  and the Middle East leave North African shores, often on craft  that are not seaworthy, trying to reach Italy, Malta and Spain.      They are often the victims of unscrupulous human traffickers  who charge large amounts for the risky voyage.      The pope said countries of origin should take measures to  eliminate the causes of illegal immigration and 'uproot all form  of criminality related to it'.      European countries had a duty to protect the human needs of  immigrants and all immigrants should respect national laws, he  said.

Here are some facts on illegal  immigration in the United States:           * An estimated 11 million to 12 million undocumented  immigrants live and work in the United States, roughly one in  every 20 workers, according to a study by the Pew Hispanic  Center based on government figures.           * Some 880,000 people were arrested crossing the  U.S.-Mexico border illegally in 2007, most of them from Mexico  and Central America, down from 1.1 million a year earlier.           * The U.S. government had built 284 miles of pedestrian and  vehicular fencing along the 2,000 mile (3,200-km) U.S.-Mexico  border by the close of 2007, and aims to construct roughly 670  miles of fencing by the end of 2008.           * In 2006, President George W. Bush proposed an overhaul of  U.S. immigration laws, offering a path to citizenship for many  undocumented immigrants, together with a guest worker program,  and tougher border and workplace enforcement.           * The legislation was opposed by Republicans in the House  of Representatives who backed a tougher security program but  were against any effort to grant citizenship rights to illegal  immigrants.           * By late 2007, state legislatures across the United States  had proposed more than 1,560 immigration-related measures. Of  these, more than 240 have become law in 46 states, according to  the National Conference of State Legislatures.

      "Text": "    TRIPOLI, July 14 (Reuters) - Libya called on the European  Union to revise new rules against illegal immigration on Monday,  saying it would urge African Union members to take action if the  EU stuck by measures that treated African migrants as criminals.      EU ministers have backed French proposals for a European  pact to stem illegal immigration and attract highly skilled  job-seekers, weeks after the EU decided illegal immigrants could  be detained for up to 18 months and face a 5-year re-entry ban.      'Africa will not accept any law based on repression and in  dealing with African migrants, including children and disabled  people, as criminals,' Libya's Foreign Ministry said in a  statement carried by the official Libyan news agency Jana.      'If they insist to keep the stand unchanged, Libya will  consult with other African Union members to study this (EU) law  and its repercussions and take a unified position on the move,'  the ministry said.      Libya, one of North Africa's gateways for migrants hoping to  reach Europe, did not say what action it hoped the African Union  would take.      The Foreign Ministry said the days when countries decided  unilaterally the fate of other countries were over, apparently  referring to Western colonisation of African states.      The European Commission estimates there are up to 8 million  illegal immigrants in the 27-nation European Union. More than  200,000 were arrested in the EU in the first half of 2007 with  just under 90,000 expelled.      The 18-month detention limit is longer than the current  maximum period in two-thirds of the EU states. Although EU  states can keep a lower limit if they want, rights groups say it  will encourage authorities to lock up more illegal immigrants.      Under the migration pact, to be finalised in October, EU  states pledge to expel more illegal immigrants while promoting  legal migration and a common asylum police by 2010.

      "Text": "    By Ingrid Melander      DAKAR, July 9 (Reuters) - Senior African officials  criticised new European Union rules against illegal immigration  on Wednesday, accusing the wealthy bloc of failing to treat  migrants with dignity and of breaking pledges to cooperate.      EU ministers backed French proposals on Monday for a  European pact to stem illegal immigration and attract highly  skilled job-seekers, weeks after the EU decided illegal  immigrants could be detained for up to 18 months and face a  5-year re-entry ban.      'Senegal is surprised by this European initiative when we  had committed ourselves ... to another path, that of dialogue,'  Senegal's Foreign Minister Cheikh Tidiane Gadio told a  conference of EU and African migration experts in Dakar.      'The time has passed when Europe decided things on its own  and Africa fell in line,' he told reporters on the sidelines of  the meeting.      The detention rule agreed by the EU in June had sparked  outrage in Latin America, where Argentina's President Cristina  Fernandez said it recalled 'times of xenophobia' and Venezuelan  President Hugo Chavez said Europe had 'legalised barbarity.'      But Africa, from where thousands of would-be immigrants risk  their lives each year trying to reach Europe in rickety boats,  had so far been largely silent on the new EU measures.      'We are absolutely opposed to this repressive... attitude  and to treating undocumented migrants as if they were  criminals,' Gadio said on Wednesday.      'It's a pity that Africans did not react more quickly to  this situation,' Dominique Guerematchi, an ambassador from  Central African Republic, told Reuters.            'SENT HOME LIKE ANIMALS'      'It's not because people want to go to Europe that they  should be sent home like animals,' Guerematchi said at the Dakar  meeting. 'We are quite shocked by this situation.'      'We were outraged to see sanctions from another time,' Alice  Bienvenu Bayidikila, Congo Republic's director of border  security, said of the new EU law. 'Illegal migration must be  fought, but in a way that respects human dignity.'      The European Commission estimates there are up to 8 million  illegal immigrants in the 27-nation European Union. More than  200,000 were arrested in the EU in the first half of 2007 with  just under 90,000 expelled.      The 18-month detention limit is longer than the current  maximum period in two-thirds of the 27 EU states. Although EU  states can keep a lower limit if they want, rights groups say it  will encourage authorities to lock up more illegal immigrants.      Under the migration pact, to be finalised in October, EU  states pledge to expel more illegal immigrants while promoting  legal migration and a common asylum policy by 2010.      These initiatives are the latest steps by EU members to  address voter concerns over immigration and they follow efforts  to set up joint border patrols and biometric police databases.      Europeans and Africans had pledged at a first ministerial  conference on migration in Morocco two years ago to work  together to handle the sensitive issue. A follow-up conference  will take place in October in Paris.

      "Text": "    STRASBOURG, June 17 (Reuters) - A law that allows illegal  immigrants to be detained for up to 18 months faced a knife-edge  vote in the European Parliament on Wednesday due to left-wing  opposition and doubts among other lawmakers, EU officials said.      After nearly three years of debate, European Union interior  ministers this month agreed the measure, which allows detention  without trial and means illegal immigrants would also face a  re-entry ban of up to 5 years.      The measure, which has been widely criticised by human  rights groups, now needs to be agreed by the European  Parliament.       Conservatives and liberals supported it in a debate on  Tuesday, giving the text a theoretical majority, while  socialists, greens and a communist-led group wanted to reduce  the detention length.      'There is a majority on paper, but there can always be  surprises, no one can predict the outcome,' one European  Parliament official said. 'It's going to be a knife-edge vote,'  another official said after the debate, adding that there would  be splits within political groups.      'This directive is a disgrace, it's an insult to  civilisation in Europe,' said Italian left-winger Giusto  Catania, saying illegal migrants should not be detained for 18  months without having committed a crime.      'We are building a Europe which is shutting down on itself,'  said fellow socialist Martine Roure, urging the bloc to take  steps to facilitate legal migration.      The 18-month limit is higher than the maximum detention in  two-thirds of the 27 EU states. Although EU states can keep a  lower limit if they want, rights groups and opponents say it  will encourage authorities to lock up more illegal migrants.      The EU executive estimates there are up to 8 million illegal  migrants in the bloc. More than 200,000 were arrested in the  first half of 2007 but less than 90,000 expelled.      EU Commissioner Jacques Barrot said on Tuesday the law was  needed to make the bloc's migration policies credible, a stance  backed by conservative and liberal lawmakers.      'It's a decisive step towards a necessary common policy on  immigration, an essential legal instrument to safeguard  fundamental rights for immigrants,' said Spanish conservative  Agustin Diaz de Mera Garcia.      'It raises standards in some member states,' British liberal  Sarah Ludford said, calling it an imperfect but necessary law.      Slovenia's interior minister Dragutin Mate warned lawmakers  that if they rejected the text it would take several more years  to reach an agreement.      The draft law allows children to be detained while saying  that should be for the shortest appropriate period of time.      Currently, illegal migrants cannot be detained for more than  40 days in Spain and a year in Hungary, according to European  Commission data. Germany already has an 18-month detention cap,  while eight EU countries, who have higher caps or none at all  would need to introduce the new EU limit.      Amnesty International's Secretary General, Irene Khan, urged  lawmakers to reject the text. 'The proposed directive is  unacceptable as an EU standard,' she said in a statement.  'Detention should only be used in very exceptional cases, always  for the shortest possible time.'

'Should the bill be approved, I will be in fine company  since the ...

The proposal is part of a package of measures against  illegal immigration drafted by Silvio Berlusconi's government  which have caused concern in Europe that they might foment  racism.      It proposes to confiscate apartments rented to illegal  immigrants, speed up expulsions, extend the time they can be  held and turn some camps for immigrants into detention centres.

      "Text": "    CINCINNATI, July 23 (Reuters) - U.S. immigration agents  raided eight Mexican restaurants in northern Ohio on Wednesday  and arrested 58 employees as part of a criminal operation  against illegal immigrants, federal authorities said.      All those arrested were citizens of Mexico and working at  Casa Fiesta, a chain of Mexican restaurants in Ashland,  Fremont, Norwalk, Oberlin, Oregon, Sandusky, Vermillion and  Youngstown, Ohio, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a  statement.      It said the raid was the culmination of more than a  yearlong investigation.      Of the 58 arrested, 54 were men. Three of the four women  were released on their own recognizance on humanitarian  grounds, ICE said. They are still required to appear before a  federal immigration judge who will determine whether they have  a legal right to remain in the United States.      The raid was the latest targeting businesses employing  illegal workers.      In May, ICE arrested more than 300 workers at  Agriprocessors Inc, a kosher meat plant in Postville, Iowa. In  August 2007, hundreds of workers at a Koch Foods chicken plant  near Cincinnati were detained in raids, while hundreds more  were detained in December 2006 after a raid at Swift & Co meat  plants in six states.      ICE said it had made 949 criminal arrests in  worksite-related raids since October 2007, including the  arrests of 105 owners, managers, supervisors or human resources  employees who face charges ranging from harboring to knowingly  hiring illegal aliens.      Immigration, specifically what do about 12 million illegal  immigrants living in the United States, is a divisive national  issue.

      "Text": "    By Tim Gaynor      PHOENIX, Feb 8 (Reuters) - What a difference a few weeks  make -- at least when it comes to the U.S. presidential  campaign and the hot issue of immigration.      When the White House race began in earnest with the first  party nominating contests in Iowa in January, a broad field of  Republican candidates vied to demonstrate their toughness on  illegal immigration, pledging more border enforcement and a  crackdown on illegal workers.      But with a narrowing of the races to secure the Republican  and Democratic nominations ahead of November's general  election, the issue could slip lower down the agenda as far as  the candidates are concerned, analysts say.      'Looking forward to the general election, it's not that  immigration is going to be redefined, it's just going to go  away,' predicted Steven Camarota, research director of the  Center for Immigration Studies think-tank, which advocates  reduced immigration.       Sen. John McCain emerged from coast-to-coast 'Super  Tuesday' nominating contests as the most likely Republican  candidate and all but sealed the deal when his nearest rival,  Mitt Romney, pulled out on Thursday.      McCain -- viewed as soft on illegal immigration by his  conservative critics -- co-sponsored a comprehensive  immigration overhaul that was nixed by the Senate in June. His  position earned McCain the lasting enmity of many Republican  voters who will likely push him to take a harder line.      On the Democratic side, the race is down to Sen. Barack  Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton, who fought to a virtual draw in  the Feb. 5 voting. They both favor measures set out in the  failed immigration bill, which sought to combine tougher border  security with a path to legal status for many of the 12 million  illegal immigrants living in the shadows.      Early Republican front-runner Romney, who ran terse  television advertisements promising get-tough measures on  illegal immigrants, is now out of the race. Mike Huckabee, who  got endorsement from the Minutemen civilian border patrol  group, is now seen as extremely unlikely to stop McCain.      'With Romney and Huckabee fading away, you essentially have  different flavors of the same proposal,' said Mark Jones, a  political science professor at Rice University in Texas.             TAKING THE MIDDLE GROUND      The question of what to do with millions of illegal  immigrants has been a hot-button topic for months in the United  States, and consistently ranks among the top three issues for  voters, alongside the economy and the war in Iraq.      Many Americans see illegal immigrants as a drain on jobs  and resources such as schools and health care. With a recession  looming, anti-immigrant feeling may intensify.      Others argue that most work illegal immigrants hard in  often low-paid jobs that would otherwise go unfilled.      The candidates who are eventually picked to run for  president by each party may try to avoid discussing  immigration, although they are unlikely to be successful. When  forced to address the issue, they could seek the hitherto  elusive middle ground, analysts said.      'Presidential candidates from both parties are going to  want to avoid it, and when they can't avoid it, they are going  to want to straddle,' said Tamar Jacoby, a senior research  fellow at the Manhattan Institute think-tank, who supported the  bipartisan Senate immigration bill.      'If you go too far in the restrictionist direction it's  going",

      "Text": "    By Gerard Bon      PARIS, June 19 (Reuters) - Tougher immigration policies  launched in President Nicolas Sarkozy's first year in office are  working, with more illegal migrants expelled and more skilled  workers let in, France's immigration minister said on Thursday.      France has said harmonising immigration policies at EU level  was one of its priorities for its six-month presidency of the  bloc that starts on July 1, and the ruling UMP party said the  data released on Thursday should help it persuade EU partners.      'The UMP would like to see our country's firm and just  policies become the policies of the whole of Europe on the  occasion of the French presidency,' the party said after  Immigration Minister Brice Hortefeux's statement.      Hortefeux said 14,660 illegal migrants were expelled from  France in the first five months of the year, up 80 percent  compared with the same period in 2007.      In the 12 months to May 2008, Sarkozy's first year in  office, almost 30,000 illegal migrants were expelled, up 31  percent year-on-year, Hortefeux said.      'Never have so many clandestine immigrants been taken back  to their own countries in a year,' Hortefeux told a news  conference at his ministry in Paris.      The number of illegal migrants in France, estimated between  200,000 and 400,000, is decreasing, he said.            CAMPAIGN PLEDGE      Tougher immigration policies were a key campaign promise by  Sarkozy, who has been criticised for setting Hortefeux annual  targets for the number of illegal migrants expelled from the  country. Human rights activists say such targets are arbitrary.      This year's expulsions target is 26,000, which Hortefeux  said he was confident would be reached.      Another target set by Sarkozy was to increase the proportion  of economic migrants, as opposed to those arriving to join  relatives, to 50 percent of new arrivals from 7 percent now.      Hortefeux said he was on course to achieve that goal, with  30,710 skilled workers allowed into the country in the 12 months  to May 31, up 36 percent compared with the previous 12 months.      So far this year, 13,429 work permits for foreigners have  been issued, and they represent 16 percent of total new arrivals  in the period, said Hortefeux.      France has been saying since last year that it would propose  an EU charter on immigration during its six-month stint as  president of the bloc, and it hoped to achieve an agreement on  the text by the end of the year.

      "Text": "    By Tim Gaynor      PHOENIX, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Thousands of people protesting  a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigrants by an Arizona  sheriff marched through Phoenix on Saturday, toting placards  reading 'We Are Human' and 'Stop the Raids.'      Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio has dispatched deputies  into Hispanic communities in the Phoenix area where they stop  people and arrest anyone who cannot prove he or she is a legal  U.S. resident.      Under a deal allowing them to enforce federal immigration  laws, the deputies have arrested more than 1,500 people whom  they determined were in Arizona illegally.      Latino activists and lawmakers call his program a clear  case of racial profiling because only people who look Hispanic  are targeted. Arpaio steadfastly denies the charge.      Earlier this month, he stirred more controversy when he  marched 220 illegal immigrants in shackles and striped prison  garb through Phoenix under armed guard.      'Walking people through the streets in chains, public  shaming, it's medieval,' said Veronica Perez, 32, an  archeologist carrying signs reading 'No Human Is Illegal' and  'Stop the Raids.'      'Isn't cruel and unusual punishment against the U.S.  Constitution?' she asked.      The event was organized by activists from the National Day  Laborer Organizing Network and a group called El Puente  Arizona. Estimates of the number of participants ranged from  1,000 to 3,000.      Preparing for the march at a park in central Phoenix,  school district coordinator Sylvia Airington, 47, slammed  Arpaio's policies.      'Racial profiling, targeting the Hispanic community -- it's  an embarrassment to America,' she said.      What to do about an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants  in the United States is an explosive political issue. But it  has largely dropped out of the debate as concerns turn to the  economic crisis.      A bid to push comprehensive immigration reform through  Congress was rejected by Republican lawmakers two years ago.  President Barack Obama, who supported the measure, has yet to  address the matter.      'I voted for Obama for change,' said welder Oscar Camacho,  45. 'But with respect to immigration, I see no change at all.'      Around 100 counter-demonstrators waving American flags  turned out to support Arpaio on Saturday. Some carried  holstered pistols.      'He is the only one to uphold illegal immigration laws,'  said Dina Rose, 52, standing on sidewalk by the sheriff's  office in downtown Phoenix. 'The county sheriff is America's  last hope of protecting our freedoms.'   (Editing by Xavier Briand)   ((Tim.Gaynor@thomsonreuters.com; +1 480 588 5296))  Keywords: IMMIGRATION PROTEST/        ",

      "Text": "    PHOENIX, Oct 7 (Reuters) - U.S. immigration agents arrested  about 300 workers at a South Carolina poultry plant on Tuesday,  the latest in a series of workplace raids targeting illegal  immigrants and employers across the United States.      The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) said  federal agents arrested the workers at the Columbia Farms  poultry processing plant in Greenville.      The nationalities of those arrested were not immediately  clear.      The swoop followed a 10-month criminal investigation that  had already resulted in charges against 11 supervisors and one  human resources manager, ICE said in a statement.      'Today's enforcement operation is the latest step in a  comprehensive criminal investigation focused on identifying the  individuals involved in allowing unauthorized workers to gain  employment,' said Kenneth Smith, the ICE special agent in  charge in Atlanta, Georgia.      'ICE targets employers because the promise of employment  draws illegal workers across our borders. By holding employers  accountable, we are diminishing the magnet and discouraging  others from breaking the law.'      All of the arrested workers were interviewed, fingerprinted  and photographed by ICE agents and were due to be processed for  removal from the United States, ICE said.      Immigration, particularly the issue of what to do with some  12 million illegal immigrants, most of them Hispanic, stirs  strong passions in the United States.      The raid in Greenville was the latest by ICE, which has  stepped up operations targeting illegal immigrants and their  employers across the United States in recent months.      In late August, agents arrested 595 workers at the Howard  Industries Inc. factory in Laurel, Miss., in the largest  workplace immigration raid to date.

      "Text": " (Adds Berlusconi comments)       By Silvia Aloisi      ROME, June 3 (Reuters) - Italy's Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi on Tuesday backtracked on a controversial bill that  would make illegal immigration a jailable offence after the  United Nations and the Vatican criticised the measure.      Berlusconi's new conservative government last month unveiled  tough measures aimed at fighting crime and illegal immigration  but which critics say risk fuelling xenophobia and racism.      One of the most controversial steps, still to be discussed  and approved by parliament, states that illegal entry into Italy  is a crime punishable by up to four years in jail.      However Berlusconi said on Tuesday that people should not be  prosecuted simply for being illegal immigrants, but their status  should be considered an aggravating circumstance if they  committed a crime.      'Personally, I don't think you can prosecute someone for  their illegal presence in our country,' Berlusconi said during a  joint news conference with French President Nicolas Sarkozy.      'Parliament is sovereign and will decide according to its  conscience and common sense,' he said.      The security package also proposes confiscating apartments  rented to illegal immigrants, speeding up expulsions and  extending the time they can be held in detention centres.      Outgoing United Nations human rights chief Louise Arbour on  Monday, describing the measures as an example of repression and  intolerance.      The Vatican also came out against them. Archbishop Agostino  Marchetti told Vatican radio that illegal immigrants should not  be treated as criminals because those who worked were making a  contribution to society.      Foreign Minister Franco Frattini shrugged off the criticism  earlier on Tuesday, saying illegal immigration was already a  criminal offence in France, Germany, Sweden and Britain.      Berlusconi was sworn in as prime minister last month after  decisively winning an April election on a law and order ticket.      Italy saw a record rise in immigration last year with  foreigners now totalling 3.5 million, and many Italians blame  immigrants -- especially Romanians and Roma people -- for crime.

      "Text": "    By Carey Gillam      KANSAS CITY, Mo., Jan 22 (Reuters) - A Kansas City parks  official whose membership in an anti-illegal immigration group  sparked the cancellation of two conventions here has resigned.      Kansas City parks board commissioner Frances Semler, a  member of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps (MCDC) which runs  patrols on the U.S. border with Mexico as part of its effort to  prompt more enforcement of U.S. immigration laws, resigned late  on Monday, the city said.      Her resignation marks the latest skirmish in an  increasingly emotional debate across America over illegal  immigration.      Although Kansas City is far from the Mexican border, the  focal point for arguments over how to handle illegal crossings  into the United States, the debate over Semler's views has  spotlighted deep divisions among Americans on the issue.      Last week, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference  said because of Semler's views it would join the National  Council of La Raza, a U.S. Hispanic advocacy group, in  rejecting Kansas City for national conventions previously  planned for the city.      Semler said frustration with a lack of enforcement of U.S.  immigration laws led her to join the Minuteman group in  December. She had planned to attend a meeting of the  organization planned for Kansas City on Feb. 1-2 but was warned  by Mayor Mark Funkhouser not to attend.      'Any individual or organization who speaks with concern of  the impact of the well-organized invasion of illegals in this  country is subjected to being called terms such as bigot or  racist,' Semler said in her resignation letter.      Southern Christian Leadership Conference CEO Charles Steele  Jr. also urged other civil rights groups to boycott the city.      Leaders of the organizations could not be reached for  comment on Tuesday, but in the past they and other critics said  the Minuteman group is a racist organization that uses guns and  intimidation against minorities.      In contrast, the group, which counts about 9,000 members  nationally, says it is a peaceful organization trying to uphold  U.S. law. Its has member patrols along the U.S. border with  Mexico and reports illegal crossings to law enforcement  agencies.      'Mayor Funkhouser is clearly running a sanctuary city (for  illegal immigrants) in Kansas City, and rather than demonstrate  some leadership by enforcing the laws, he has chosen to play  racial politics...' said Chris Simcox, Minuteman Civil Defense  Corps president.

      "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Sept 17 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on  Wednesday upheld an Arizona law that targets employers who hire  illegal immigrants by revoking their licenses to do business in  the state.      The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals noted that the 2007  law, which has not been enforced, arose from 'rising  frustration with the United States Congress's failure to enact  comprehensive immigration reform.'      Some 12 million illegal immigrants are believed to live in  the United States; many work with false papers and the issue of  what to do with them has become a political hot potato.      It was not immediately clear whether Arizona would now  begin enforcing the law or if its opponents would appeal to the  U.S. Supreme Court.      Arizona passed the employer sanctions law after a federal  immigration overhaul died in the U.S. Congress in June 2007.      Immigration, business and civil rights groups challenged  the law, saying it was preempted by federal rules governing  immigration.      The groups also contended the law, called the Legal Arizona  Workers Act, violates employers' due process rights by denying  them the chance to challenge allegations that their workers are  illegal before their licenses are revoked.      But the appeals court ruled that federal law does not  preempt the Act or its requirement that employers to use an  electronic verification system to check the work-authorization  status of employees through federal records.      The court also ruled that the law 'can and should be  reasonably interpreted to allow employers, before any license  can be adversely affected, to present evidence to rebut the  presumption that an employee is unauthorized.'      Although the court upheld the law 'in all respects', it  noted that its opinion did not bar later challenges once it is  enforced.

      "Text": "    *Obama and McCain court Hispanic vote      *Fastest growing minority is now 9 percent of electorate      *Obama says McCain flip-flopped on immigration policy           By John Whitesides and Jeff Mason      WASHINGTON, June 28 (Reuters) - Democrat Barack Obama and  Republican John McCain courted Hispanic support on Saturday,  and Obama accused his White House rival of backing away from  comprehensive U.S. immigration reform under pressure from his  party.      In separate appearances before a group of Latino public  officials, the two presidential contenders portrayed themselves  as dedicated champions for Hispanics -- a fast-growing and  critical swing voting bloc in November's election.      Obama took aim at McCain's approach to comprehensive  immigration reform and his change of emphasis on legislation to  offer a pathway to citizenship for the country's 12 million  illegal immigrants.      McCain, an Arizona senator, broke with his party and worked  for the plan, which ultimately failed in Congress amid heavy  Republican opposition.      But he shifted his approach during the fight for the  party's nomination to emphasize the need to secure U.S. borders  before addressing the status of illegal immigrants.      'One place where Senator McCain used to offer change was on  immigration. He was a champion of comprehensive reform, and I  admired him for it,' Obama, an Illinois senator who supported  the proposal, told the National Association of Latino Elected  and Appointed Officials.      'But when he was running for his party's nomination, he  walked away from that commitment. He said he wouldn't even  support his own legislation if it came up for a vote,' he said.  'If we are going to solve the challenges we face, we can't  vacillate, we can't shift depending on our politics.'      McCain, who appeared before the group ahead of Obama,  admitted the plan 'wasn't very popular with some in my party'  but said he would still work for a broad-based overhaul of U.S.  immigration laws.      'It'll be my top priority yesterday, today and tomorrow,'  McCain said when asked if immigration reform would be high on  his to-do list in his first 100 days in office.      A McCain spokesman accused Obama of voting for 'poison  pill' amendments that doomed the immigration deal.      'It was Obama himself who worked to kill the Senate's  bipartisan immigration reform compromise last year,' Brian  Rogers said in a statement.      The Obama campaign shot back that McCain had thanked Obama  for his support on the issue in 2006.      McCain told the Latino officials the proposal failed  because Americans were not confident Congress would protect  U.S. borders before dealing with the question of illegal  immigration.           'GOD'S CHILDREN'      'I want to assure you we will address this issue in a  humane and compassionate fashion,' he said, calling illegal  immigrants 'God's children.'      Hispanics are the fastest growing minority group in the  United States and account for about 9 percent of the national  electorate. They could be a critical swing voting bloc in  November battleground states like Florida and in the U.S.  Southwest.      In 2004, President George W. Bush won about 40 percent of  the Hispanic vote -- a Republican record -- in defeating  Democrat John Kerry. But opinion polls show Republicans have  been hurt with Hispanics by the debate over immigration  reform.      Obama has had his own problem with Hispanics, who heavily  suppo",

      "Text": "    By John Buchanan      ATLANTA, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Many illegal immigrants in the  United States are manual laborers on low wages. But there's  another group that attracts much less attention: entrepreneurs who  have set up businesses, created jobs and grown affluent.      There are up to 20,000 illegal immigrants earning upward of  $100,000 a year as entrepreneurs, and their existence challenges  the stereotype that illegal immigrants are a drain on the U.S.  economy, according to immigration lawyers and academics.      Many say they are living the 'American Dream,' but almost none  trumpet their achievements because they fear deportation.      One example is a 38-year-old computer engineer who overstayed  his visa after arriving from Colombia in 1999. Not long after, he  founded a Web design firm in Miami that specializes in  e-commerce.      Today it's a fast-growing, tax-paying company that recently  developed a Web platform for online radio and television that  could be a breakthrough technology.      'We are at a good point now, making money,' said the man, who  spoke on condition of anonymity because of his immigration status.  'We are growing every month because our customers are happy. They  are U.S. companies making a lot of money from our Web sites.'      But the man is near the end of a long administrative process  that will likely lead to his deportation. Then his company would  close and workers, including Americans, would be laid off.      'I have always tried to look at things in a positive way but  now I am disappointed,' he said in a telephone interview.      Michael Bander, a Miami immigration lawyer who has represented  the man for six years, said his client's dilemma showed a larger  flaw in the immigration system.           SPECIAL STATUS?      It is not easy to determine the number of illegal immigrants  who earn six figure salaries, but there could be 20,000 of them  and a significant proportion earn up to $300,000 a year, said Jeff  Passel, lead demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center in  Washington.      Advocates see the group as trailblazers for the more than 12  million illegal immigrants estimated to be living in the United  States, most from Mexico or other Latin American countries.      'These people should be treated like heroes not criminals,'  said Felipe Korzenny, professor of marketing and communications at  Florida State University. Wealthy illegal immigrants also came  from India, China, Taiwan, Israel and South Africa, he said.      Congress should address their unique situation, not least  because they have more to lose than others, said George Tzamaras,  spokesman for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.      The United States runs a Green Card residence permit program  for investors but it does not apply to those already in the  country illegally.      But opponents of illegal immigration said the United States  should grant no special status according to wealth for people who  break the law.      'They should be deported as existing law dictates. We'd like  to see their assets seized to compensate American taxpayers who  are losing billions of dollars due to rampant illegal  immigration,' said William Gheen, president of Americans for Legal  Immigration.      'We need to send a strong message to people who would like to  come to the U.S. that disrespect for our laws will not lead to  prosperity,' said Gheen.

      "Text": "    PARIS, April 24 (Reuters) - France will give work permits to  hundreds of illegal immigrants on a case-by-case basis but will  not offer a general amnesty, the government said on Thursday.      The powerful CGT trade union and the government say  negotiations are going smoothly over the fate of illegal  workers, some of whom have been on strike since last week to  demand legal status.      'Today... around 800 dossiers have been submitted, that  gives an indication of the number,' Immigration Minister Brice  Hortefeux told RTL radio. He also told Le Figaro newspaper there  would be 'no massive regularisation'.      Some restaurant and hotel industry groups say there will be  a crisis unless the government softens its stance on illegal  immigration, and the hotel sector has called for 50,000 to  100,000 work permits to be awarded.      Churches and rights groups regularly call for an end to  deportations, which have increased since President Nicolas  Sarkozy made clamping down on illegal immigration a priority  when he was interior minister in a previous government.      They also want clearer rules to govern illegal immigrants,  but Hortefeux says current measures are sufficient as they   allow local officials to issue work permits to applicants who  are already employed in sectors short of labour.      The far-right National Front rejects any granting of work  permits to illegal immigrants and has called for a protest on  Friday against the hotel industry's request.      Since the 1960s, France has given hundreds of thousands of  work permits to illegal immigrants, though the numbers have been  on a clear downward trend in recent years.      Sarkozy has spoken out against broad amnesties declared  unilaterally by some European Union countries, arguing that the  EU's open borders mean a single state's policy affects the bloc  as a whole.      In 2006, Italy granted residency to some 500,000 illegal  immigrants, while Spain legalised almost 570,000.      Sarkozy wants to harmonise EU immigration policy, a theme on  which he is likely to focus when France takes up the 27-member  bloc's rotating presidency in July.

      "Text": "    ROME, May 19 (Reuters) - Italy's foreign minister said the  Spanish government's criticism of its immigration policies was  unacceptable and told Madrid on Monday to stay out of Italian  affairs.      'Declarations from ministers that interfere with the  activities of a government elected by the Italian citizens are  not acceptable, especially in areas like immigration which need  close cooperation between Spain and Italy,' Franco Frattini said  in a radio interview.      'Frankly, it's time to stop these (political) pitch  invasions,' he said.      Frattini was referring to comments on Friday by Spain's  deputy prime minister, Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega, who  criticised the immigration stance of the new Italian government  run by conservative Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.      'The government rejects violence, racism and xenophobia and  therefore cannot agree with what is happening in Italy,' she  said.      Berlusconi's government is discussing legislation that could  make illegal immigration a custodial offence. According to media  reports it might also hasten deportations and turn holding  centres into detention camps.      The policies come after an election where crime committed by  foreigners, especially Roma or gypsies, became a major political  issue. Police arrested some 400 suspected illegal immigrants  associated with crime in a crackdown last week.      Some Italians have taken the law into their own hands. An  illegal Roma camp in Naples had to be evacuated after local  people set fire to shacks after news of a Roma girl apparently  trying to kidnap an Italian baby.      A European human rights watchdog has criticised events in  Italy. The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights  said it was 'troubled by the recent incidents of violence  against Roma in Italy'.

      "Text": "    By Natalie Armstrong      TORONTO, Jan 9 (Reuters Life!) - Well-educated immigrants  earn less money after they leave the welfare system than do  less-educated native-born Canadians, new research says.      And, it says, the earnings gap widens quickly with time.      'The disadvantage that immigrants faced got worse after  they went through a welfare-to-work program,' Ernie Lightman,  an economist at the University of Toronto and co-author of the  study published in the Social Policy and Society journal.      '(Immigrants will) go from one dead-end job to another,  it's as if there's a ceiling that they just can't break  through.'      The study, based on a 2001 telephone poll of 800 people in  Toronto who left Ontario's provincial welfare system, found  that 74 percent of native-born Canadians made more than C$10  ($9.90) an hour, compared with 58 percent of immigrants.      Meanwhile, the study said immigrants overall tended to be  better educated than native-born Canadians. More than one-third  of the immigrants polled had post-secondary education or  greater, compared with 20 percent of native-born Canadians.      The poll found a C$2.52 hourly wage gap between immigrants,  who made C$11.96, compared to native-born Canadians, who made  C$14.48.      When native-born Canadians moved on to their second job,  they reported a 44 percent wage increase while immigrants'  wages grew only by 3.2 percent.      Lightman said that native-born Canadians were generally  better off once they moved on to their second job after leaving  welfare, compared with immigrants doing the same.      'There was essentially no step up, they just make a lateral  shift from one appalling job to another,' Lightman said, adding  new welfare-to-work programs are needed specifically targeted  at immigrants.      'It doesn't help them break out of the cycle of  dependency.... We need to look more specifically at what the  labor-market needs of immigrants are, and we don't do that.'

The scuffles occurred when police tried to carry out  identity checks of the immigrants, who were staging a sit-in  inside the cathedral after a fire razed the building they were  living in last week.      They accuse authorities of finding new homes for Italians  living in the building while turning a blind eye to them.      Union officials and others supporting the immigrants said  police charged the protesters, but police denied it, saying  there were only moments of 'contact.'      Two immigrants out of the roughly 50 protesting were  detained, police said.      A Naples city official criticised police for 'assaulting and  wildly pounding' peaceful protesters while the Cgil union called  it 'premeditated and violent aggression against the poor and  desperate.'      The incident comes a few days after Italy's government  declared a national emergency on illegal immigration, sparking  an uproar from leftists and other critics who accuse it of  exaggerating the situation and stoking fear and racism.

      "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The United States expects to  deport more than 200,000 immigrants this year who are serving  time in prisons and jails across the country, the top U.S.  immigration enforcement official said.      The move to speed the deportation of foreign-born criminals  aims to help federal and state prisons reduce the costs of  housing immigrants, Julie Myers, head of the U.S. Immigration  and Customs Enforcement agency, told The New York Times.      Illegal immigration has emerged as one of the most  passionate in the campaign for the 2008 U.S. presidential  election.      In 2007, ICE brought formal immigration charges against  164,000 immigrants who are behind bars nationwide, the Times  reported on Tuesday.      Many of those immigrants are slated for deportation this  year, she told the newspaper.      The Times said in 2006, the agency identified 64,000  immigrants behind bars, most of whom were deported.      Myers said in the past year, federal agents have stepped up  efforts to find immigrants behind bars and complete immigration  proceedings so they could be deported directly from prison  without being released into the streets, Myers said.      Foreigners behind bars include large numbers of immigrants  who were legal residents, but lost their legal status as a  result of being convicted of crimes, Myers told the Times.      In 2007, ICE sent 276,912 immigrants to their home  countries, including many who had never been arrested for  crimes, but were deported for civil immigration violations, The  New York Times reported.      The newspaper said Myers also confirmed that ICE adopted a  new policy last week requiring a court order for medical staff  members to give sedation drugs to immigrants being deported.

      "Text": "    ROME, July 31 (Reuters) - About 800 illegal immigrants  landed in Southern Italy on Thursday, with emergency services  warning that already crowded holding centres are near collapse  in a country that has declared an immigration emergency.      Early on Thursday about 400 immigrants on a 17-metre  (55-foot) boat, which was listing dangerously, were guided by  Italian coastguard officers into the port of Lampedusa, a small  island south of the Italian mainland.      Four smaller boats were later intercepted at sea off the  island and 400 more immigrants were brought into port by  coastguards.      Most of the arrivals, who included women and children,  appeared to be of African origin. Many were not wearing shoes as  they had been told to remove them on boarding the boats before  departure, most probably on the Libyan coast.      The local holding centre in Lampedusa is already housing  some 700 illegal immigrants who arrived in the last few days and  is close to its capacity of 1,500 people.      Italy's centre-right government is cracking down on illegal  immigration, with tough new laws aimed at making it easier to  expel them and imposing tougher sentences on those committing  crimes. Last Friday it declared a state of emergency over the  influx of immigrants arriving on Italy's long shoreline.

      "Text": "    MADRID, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Spain reduced the number of  illegal immigrants landing on its beaches by 26 percent last  year thanks to better cooperation with African countries, the  Interior Minister said on Monday.      A total of 13,424 illegal immigrants arrived last year, most  of them arriving on the Canary Islands, down from a peak of  39,180 in 2006, Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said.      'The policies we have put in place to avoid the departure of  immigrants from their countries is gradually producing results,'  Rubalcaba told a news conference.       Spain has offered more aid to west African countries, where  most illegal immigrants to Spain come from. It has also beefed  up cooperation with local police forces and persuaded several  developing nations to accept the return of illegal immigrants.      Every year thousands of Africans sailing in overcrowded,  wooden boats try to reach Europe via Spain in search of jobs and  a better life. Scores have died in the attempt.      The ministry said the number of illegal immigrants who were  repatriated to their countries of origin from Spain fell by 17  percent to 46,426 people, compared with the previous year.      Rubalcaba said he doubted Spain's economic crisis was  dissuading Africans from trying to reach its shores.      'My impression is that the situation is so bad in Africa it  has very little effect.'      Spain's Socialist government was heavily criticised in 2005  for granting a three-month amnesty to about 700,000 illegal  immigrants already living in the country. Other EU countries and  the conservative opposition said the move would encourage  illegal immigration.

      "Text": "    By Lara Hertel      TORONTO, June 25 (Reuters Life!) - Canada is now home to  more immigrants than at any time in the past 75 years and they  have more in common with home-grown Canucks than one might  think, according to a new report.      A national survey of 2,299 Canadians found that they placed  the highest value on freedom, democracy and equality,  regardless of where they were born.      This comes as no surprise to Jason Klinck, coordinator for  the Centre for Newcomers in Calgary, Alberta, a non-profit  organization that provides settlement services to new  Canadians.      'Canadians share many of the same values with immigrants  because our connection with them is stronger,' he said in an  interview.      'We have a whole generation of people who were born in  Canada to parents who were born elsewhere.'      A 2006 Statistics Canada report indicates that   approximately one in five Canadians were born outside the  country, bringing the number of foreign-born Canadians to a  75-year high.      Figures released the same year show that most immigrants,  13 percent, come from China, followed by India with 12 percent  and the Philippines with seven percent.      'Immigrations is becoming more and more a part of the  Canadian identity  -- it's not on the fringes anymore,' Klinck  said.         The national poll commissioned by credit card company  MasterCard comes days before Canadians celebrate their national  identity on July 1st.      'We really wanted to find out how people who weren't born  here feel about being Canadian, and we found there's a lot of  pride in being associated with this country,' said Julie  Wilson, director of public affairs, MasterCard Canada in  Toronto.      'We assume that people want to come to Canada for political  reasons, but immigrants usually said they're here because their  families are here too. Family truly makes the home,' Wilson  added.      Economic reasons are also a big pull, said Klinck.      Those born outside of Canada were more likely to cite  diversity as a key Canadian value, the survey found.      The poll also found that immigrants share many of the same  culinary tastes as their home-grown peers, with Canadian beef  being the favorite, followed by maple syrup, poutine, which is  a potato dish topped with sauce and cheese, and hamburgers.

      "Text": "    By Robin Emmott      NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico, Jan 15 - Illegal immigrants from  Latin America are heading deeper into the United States to find  work and avoid deportation as crackdowns in border states like  Texas and Arizona make life more difficult for them.      The U.S. Border Patrol has ramped up surveillance along the  porous Mexican border aided by National Guard troops since  2005, while police and state legislatures have increasingly  targeted illegal immigrants in some border states.      'Texas is crawling with Border Patrol agents and the locals  are so tuned in that if they see you walking down the street,  they phone the Border Patrol, who come and deport you,' said Joe  Reyes, 45, who lived for seven years in Houston before being  deported in November.      'I'm heading for North Carolina if I can get back across,'  he said at the Catholic-run migrant shelter in Nuevo Laredo,  across the border from Laredo, Texas.      Washington hired thousands more Border Patrol agents last  year to help deport immigrants who entered illegally or  outstayed their visas, carry out workplace raids, jail illegals  and push police to enforce immigration laws.      While workplace raids are common in central and northern  states, Arizona and Texas are now arguably the toughest places  for undocumented immigrants.      In Arizona, once a popular state for fresh arrivals due to  its desert border with Mexico, companies are laying off  undocumented workers after a new law came into effect on Jan. 1  punishing companies who hire illegal immigrants.      Family networks in border states are still a strong pull  for new immigrants and some are willing to risk living in  Texas, which has a Hispanic heritage and big Hispanic  population.      But migrant shelters and people smugglers are warning  illegal immigrants that they need to go farther north to last  long in the United States.      'Our message to new migrants, and those trying to get back  to the United States after being deported, is that if they  really want to go, avoid California, Arizona, New Mexico and  Texas,' said Eduardo Carrera, a volunteer at a shelter in Nuevo  Laredo, where migrants stop on their way to the United States.           BETTER PAY UP NORTH      For decades, illegal immigrants have crossed the border  into the United States, where an estimated 12 million live and  work in the shadows. Many would traditionally settle in the  four border states, where there are plenty of temporary jobs on  farms, in construction and in the service economy.      But better wages in northern states -- such as Virginia,  Maryland and Washington -- amid a slowing U.S. economy are also  changing that trend.      'There is a growing economic incentive to migrate to  non-traditional destinations. The fact that surveillance may be  less intense in these areas is an added benefit,' said Wayne  Cornelius, an immigration expert at the University of  California, San Diego.      According to a study by Pew Hispanic Center research  institute, some 57 U.S. counties in mainly northern and central  states doubled their population of Hispanics, including both  legal and illegal immigrants, between 2000 and 2006.      'Very few are in the traditional Hispanic areas of the  southwest,' said Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at the center.  'There is a very big concentration in Virginia, mostly in the  Washington D.C. suburbs,' he added.      People smugglers in Tijuana near San Diego say they are  taking m",

      "Text": "    SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Immigrants are far less  likely than the average U.S.-born citizen to commit crime in  California, the most populous state in the United States,  according to a report issued late on Monday.      People born outside the United States make up about 35 percent  of California's adult population but account for about 17 percent  of the adult prison population, the report by the Public Policy  Institute of California showed.      According to the report's authors the findings suggest that  long-standing fears of immigration as a threat to public safety  are unjustified. The report also noted that U.S.-born adult men  are incarcerated at a rate more than 2 1/2 times greater than that  of foreign-born men.      'Our research indicates that limiting immigration,  requiring higher educational levels to obtain visas, or  spending more money to increase penalties against criminal  immigrants will have little impact on public safety,' said  Kristin Butcher, co-author of the report and associate  professor of economics at Wellesley College.      The study did not differentiate between documented immigrants  and illegal immigrants.      The question of what to do about the millions of undocumented  workers living in the United States has been one of the major  issues in the U.S. presidential election. Mexico, which accounts  for a high proportion of illegal immigrants in California, was  deeply disappointed at the U.S. Congress' failure to pass  President George W. Bush's overhaul of immigration laws last  year.      When Butcher and her co-author, Anne Morrison Piehl,  associate professor of economics at Rutgers University,  considered all those committed to institutions including  prison, jails, halfway houses and the like, they found an even  greater disparity.      Among men 18 to 40, the population most likely to be in  institutions because of criminal activity, the report found  that in California, U.S.-born men were institutionalized 10  times more often than foreign-born men (4.2 percent vs. 0.42  percent).      Among other findings in the report, non-citizen men from  Mexico 18 to 40 -- a group disproportionately likely to have  entered the United States illegally -- are more than eight  times less likely than U.S.-born men in the same age group to  be in a correctional institution (0.48 percent vs. 4.2  percent).      'From a public safety standpoint, there would be little  reason to further limit immigration, to favor entry by  high-skilled immigrants, or to increase penalties against  criminal immigrants,' the report said.

      "Text": "    By Andrew Hay      MADRID, Aug 7 (Reuters) - The number of immigrants seeking  government aid to leave Spain has doubled in 2008 as  unemployment soars following the collapse of a decade-long  economic boom, official data show.      Spain's Socialist government received 2,100 requests up to  July from immigrants who say they cannot afford to return home,  compared with 1,184 during all of last year, and this year's   funds for the subsidy scheme are exhausted.      'We've already spent our budget because there's a flood of  requests during the economic crisis,' said a spokeswoman for  Spain's department of immigration and emigration.      Over 4 million immigrants, mostly from Latin America and  eastern Europe, have flocked to Spain since around 2000 looking  for work in construction and jobs like cleaning and child care.      They are among the first workers to be laid off as building  firms go bankrupt and companies and households cut back staff in  a country teetering on the brink of recession.      A total of 457,000 workers have lost their jobs over the  last 12 months, giving Spain the highest unemployment rate in  the European Union as the end of its housing boom coincides with  the global credit crisis and inflation at a 13-year high.      Spain has some 5 million immigrants, about 11 percent of the  population, and unemployment is rising three times faster among  immigrants than in the wider workforce, increasing 69 percent in  the past year to 266,458 registered jobless, government data  show.      Bolivians, Argentines, Colombians and Ecuadoreans are  leaving Spain in the greatest numbers, the government said.      The travel subsidy scheme, with a 1.7 million euro budget,  is only one government programme to encourage immigrants to  leave Spain rather than join the ranks of jobless which swelled  to a 10-year high of 2.43 million in June.      The government has also said it wants to tighten  requirements for family reunification to restrict immigrant  flows.      More than 100,000 immigrants are expected to leave Spain  from September onwards, taking advantage of a separate programme  to pay jobless immigrants the equivalent of two years  unemployment benefit if they go home.      The travel subsidy scheme is operated by Spanish non-profit  groups and gives each immigrant between 50 and 400 euros ($77.50  and $620) to journey home, plus 400 to 1400 euros per family.      Groups such as the International Organization for Migration,  the Spanish Red Cross and the Spanish Catholic Commission  Association for Immigration say they have more than 2,000  immigrants on waiting lists seeking funds to return home.

A report on the newspaper's website on Saturday said it  would be the first time since the Vietnam War that the armed  forces would be open to temporary immigrants, provided they  have lived in the United States for at least two years.      Immigrants with permanent resident status, or 'green  cards,' are eligible to enlist in the U.S. military.      A Pentagon spokesman said he knew of the program but had no  details.      The Times said the program could help the military fill  shortages in medical care, language interpretation and field  intelligence analysis. It will be limited to 1,000 enlistees in  its first year, most for the Army and some for other services.      Temporary immigrants who want to enlist would have to prove  they had lived in the United States for two years and had not  been out of the country for more than 90 days during that time.  They would also have to pass an English test.

      "Text": "    MADRID, May 16 (Reuters) - Spain rebuked Italy on Friday for  its clampdown on suspected illegal immigrants, calling the  arrest of hundreds of foreigners racist and xenophobic.      Italian police announced on Thursday they had arrested 268  foreigners as part of a week-long operation, with 53 immediately  taken to the border for expulsion.      'The government rejects violence, racism and xenophobia and  therefore cannot agree with what is happening in Italy,' Spanish  Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega said at  the cabinet's weekly news conference.      The comments were the latest exchange of harsh words between  the Socialist government of Spain and Silvio Berlusconi's  right-wing administration, both recently re-elected.      Berlusconi raised tempers in Spain last month by dubbing   the newly formed cabinet, with its majority of female members,  'too pink'.      Berlusconi swept back to power for a third term as Italian  prime minister promising to crack down on illegal immigrants,  blamed by many for crime.      In contrast, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez was  widely criticized in 2005 for being too soft on immigration  after he granted an amnesty to nearly 700,000 illegal workers in  an attempt to bring them into the tax net.      A short distance from Africa, Spain is an entry point to  Europe for many illegal immigrants.

      "Text": " (Refile to fix typo in dateline)      By Robin Emmott      NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Illegal immigrants  from Latin America are heading deeper into the United States to  find work and avoid deportation as crackdowns in border states  like Texas and Arizona make life more difficult for them.      The U.S. Border Patrol has ramped up surveillance along the  porous Mexican border aided by National Guard troops since  2005, while police and state legislatures have increasingly  targeted illegal immigrants in some border states.      'Texas is crawling with Border Patrol agents and the locals  are so tuned in that if they see you walking down the street,  they phone the Border Patrol, who come and deport you,' said Joe  Reyes, 45, who lived for seven years in Houston before being  deported in November.      'I'm heading for North Carolina if I can get back across,'  he said at the Catholic-run migrant shelter in Nuevo Laredo,  across the border from Laredo, Texas.      Washington hired thousands more Border Patrol agents last  year to help deport immigrants who entered illegally or  outstayed their visas, carry out workplace raids, jail illegals  and push police to enforce immigration laws.      While workplace raids are common in central and northern  states, Arizona and Texas are now arguably the toughest places  for undocumented immigrants.      In Arizona, once a popular state for fresh arrivals due to  its desert border with Mexico, companies are laying off  undocumented workers after a new law came into effect on Jan. 1  punishing companies who hire illegal immigrants.      Family networks in border states are still a strong pull  for new immigrants and some are willing to risk living in  Texas, which has a Hispanic heritage and big Hispanic  population.      But migrant shelters and people smugglers are warning  illegal immigrants that they need to go farther north to last  long in the United States.      'Our message to new migrants, and those trying to get back  to the United States after being deported, is that if they  really want to go, avoid California, Arizona, New Mexico and  Texas,' said Eduardo Carrera, a volunteer at a shelter in Nuevo  Laredo, where migrants stop on their way to the United States.           BETTER PAY UP NORTH      For decades, illegal immigrants have crossed the border  into the United States, where an estimated 12 million live and  work in the shadows. Many would traditionally settle in the  four border states, where there are plenty of temporary jobs on  farms, in construction and in the service economy.      But better wages in northern states -- such as Virginia,  Maryland and Washington -- amid a slowing U.S. economy are also  changing that trend.      'There is a growing economic incentive to migrate to  non-traditional destinations. The fact that surveillance may be  less intense in these areas is an added benefit,' said Wayne  Cornelius, an immigration expert at the University of  California, San Diego.      According to a study by Pew Hispanic Center research  institute, some 57 U.S. counties in mainly northern and central  states doubled their population of Hispanics, including both  legal and illegal immigrants, between 2000 and 2006.      'Very few are in the traditional Hispanic areas of the  southwest,' said Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at the center.  'There is a very big concentration in Virginia, mostly in the  Washington D.C. suburbs,' he added.      People smugglers in ",

Some of those held in the operation, which stretched from  northern Italy to the Campania region around Naples, were  ordered to be immediately expelled.      Silvio Berlusconi swept back to power for a third term as  prime minister last week promising to get tough on illegal  immigrants, who are blamed by many Italians for crime. His  government is preparing new laws to screen immigrants.      In Rome, the police raided at least one makeshift camp of  Roma people from Eastern Europe, who bear the brunt of  widespread public concern about immigrant crime.      Television showed police loading some Roma men onto buses in  Rome's biggest settlement for people known in Italy as 'nomads'.      Romania, a fellow EU member which has Europe's biggest Roma  population, has warned Italy against an outbreak of 'xenophobia'  against its people, though Berlusconi's government has reassured  Bucharest that Romanians are not being targeted.      Illegal Roma camps in Naples had to be evacuated by police  this week after local people, angry at an alleged baby-snatching  incident involving a 17-year-old Roma girl, set fire to their  shacks repeatedly during the night. Nobody was injured.      Italy's new interior minister, Roberto Maroni from the  anti-immigrant Northern League party, is rushing out emergency  legislation that could bring back passport checks on Italy's  European Union borders, despite its membership of the Schengen  passport-free zone.

      "Text": "    ATHENS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Hundreds of illegal immigrants  held in a detention centre on the Greek island of Lesbos have  fallen ill after drinking contaminated water from rusty and  mouldy pipes, police said on Wednesday.      Police said hospital staff rushed to provide emergency  medication after the weekend incident at the centre, where  medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) denounced a  'humanitarian crisis' in July.      'Almost all of the immigrants at the detention centre have  been poisoned,' a police official, who declined to be named,  told Reuters.       'They are in a bad condition, but they can not be  transferred to hospital as they are too many and in a bad  state,' the official said.      About 600 immigrants, many of them from war-torn Somalia and  Afghanistan, were detained on the eastern Aegean island. The  police official said water pipes at the centre were old and  toilets were not working properly.      Greece has been criticised internationally for the poor  conditions in its six detention centres and its harsh treatment  of migrants who arrived in Greece without identity papers to  seek asylum from war-torn countries such as Afghanistan.      MSF ended an emergency programme at the Lesbos detention  centre last month, saying Greece's conservative government was  providing no support for its efforts to improve conditions  there.      'We hope this will finally push the government into taking  some action,' said Nondas Paschos, a spokesman for MSF Greece.      Greece, with just 11 million inhabitants and one of the  lowest per capita GDPs in the euro zone, is struggling to cope  with a rising tide of migrants swamping its long coastline and  border with Turkey. Police registered 112,000 illegal migrants  last year, versus just 40,000 in 2005.      EU leaders were due to approve a new pact on immigration and  asylum at a summit this week, aimed at tightening border  controls and easing the repatriation of illegal migrants.

      "Text": "    MADRID, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Spain will try to persuade  jobless immigrants to leave by offering to pay them a lump sum  and then provide unemployment benefits in their home countries,  the government said on Friday.      The move continues a radical policy shift by Spain's  Socialist government, which granted an amnesty to 700,000  illegal immigrants in 2004, but this year said it would slash  the number of new work permits and limit family reunion visas.      With unemployment jumping by a quarter in a year to 2.5  million, the government is worried that immigrant workers will  not find jobs and will overstretch public services.      'This decree will helps us manage immigration flows,' Labour  Minister Celestino Corbacho told a news conference.      Friday's law will give almost 300,000 unemployed immigrants  the option to be paid two years of benefit if they leave the  country. An intiial 40 percent would be paid as a lump sum  before they leave and the rest gradually once they return home.      The sums involved vary greatly depending on individual  factors such as how long an immigrant had contributed to the  Spanish social security system.      Immigrant groups have complained that the measure does not  provide enough money for it really to be worth their while to go  back and also that it brands foreigners as a problem.      'The immigrant stops being someone who brings wealth and  becomes someone we want to get off our backs,' said Juan Carlos  Rois of AESCO, which represents Latin Americans in Spain.      The government's offer will not be open to Spain's largest  immigrant community, Romanians, or residents in Spain from other  European Union member states.      Over 10 percent of Spain's population is made up of  immigrants who have arrived in the country over the last decade  to fill low-paid job vacancies in the once-booming construction  industry and the restaurant and commerce sectors.      A punctured property bubble has left these two pillars of  growth crumbling and many analysts expect the Spain to enter  recession in the second half, a sharp fall from the robust 3.7  percent GDP rise in 2007.

      "Text": "    By Nick Carey      HOLLAND, Ohio, Oct 17 (Reuters) - After three days as a key  figure in the U.S. presidential campaign, Joe the Plumber would  like his old life back -- as soon as he finishes another round  of interviews.      'I'm just a plumber. I just want to get on with my life and  do my job,' Joe Wurzelbacher said in an interview on Friday  outside his modest home in middle America. 'I'd prefer to do  that without people camped out on my doorstep.'      Wurzelbacher's privacy became a victim of modern day  politics. Anxious to appear in touch with ordinary Americans  ahead of the Nov. 4 presidential election, Democrat Barack  Obama and Republican John McCain brought Wurzelbacher, 34, into  the glare of the presidential election campaign in their debate  Wednesday night and the plumber's life has been far from  ordinary ever since.      Early in the debate McCain cited Wurzelbacher as an example  of someone who would be hurt under Obama's tax plan. The  sparring candidates went on to refer to Joe the Plumber more  than two dozen times in the televised debate and within hours a  media circus had descended on a previously quiet street of  modest homes in the suburbs of Toledo.      Reporters quickly revealed that Wurzelbacher did not have a  plumbing license, had fallen behind on his taxes, had a real  first name of Sam, not Joe, along with other personal details  of Wurzelbacher's life.      It has left Joe the Plumber feeling drained.      'It's been tough to have the media all over this and coming  up with some things that aren't true,' he said. 'I have family  to think about, I have a 13-year-old son, it's hard to have  them see so many things about me that are negative.'           CONSERVATIVE MEDIA DARLING      To be sure, Wurzelbacher initially courted the attention.  It all started when Obama, campaigning door-to-door in  Wurzelbacher's neighborhood for the benefit of a trailing media  pack, met the plumber. Wurzelbacher asked a few pointed  questions about Obama's tax policy, complaining he could not  afford some of the provisions.      The confrontation made Wurzelbacher the darling of  conservative media for a day or two. Then came the debate.      The single father thinks all the attention is crazy.      'There are bigger issues to worry about than me,'  Wurzelbacher said. 'Whoever wins the election is going to have  to deal with things like people losing their jobs, health care  and immigration. This shouldn't be about me. It should be about  them.'      While the media have managed to dig up many personal  details of Wurzelbacher's life, he has kept at least one thing  secret: 'No one knows who I'm voting for,' he said, although he  has said he thought McCain did well in the debate.      McCain has apologized for subjecting Wurzelbacher to such  media scrutiny but he is in for a few more days of fame. While  camera crews remained stationed outside his home on Friday  morning, Wurzelbacher headed to New York for a couple more  media appearances.      His house remains a political tourist attraction for those  who see Wurzelbacher as one of them -- ordinary Americans often  overlooked by Washington.      Just after Wurzelbacher headed out, a couple of young guys  drove by in a red Chevrolet pickup truck. They slowed down to  yell encouragement.     'Good job, Joe,' they said. 'Way to go standing up for  America.'     (Reporting by Nick Carey; Writing by Andrea Hopkins; Editing  by Bill Trott)   ((andrea.hopkins@thom",

      "Text": "    By Jeff Mason      MIAMI, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee  John McCain said on Friday an Ohio man dubbed 'Joe the  Plumber,' who raised questions about Democrat Barack Obama's  tax plan, was being smeared by Democratic attacks.      McCain spent the day campaigning in Florida, trying to fend  off a strong challenge from Obama in a state the Republicans  have taken in the last two presidential elections but is up for  grabs on Nov. 4.      Obama was in Roanoke, Virginia, a traditionally Republican  state that is also tilting more Democratic this year. The  Illinois senator attacked McCain's health care plan.      Leading national opinion polls and surveys in key  battleground states, Obama picked up the endorsements of The  Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times.      The Post said both Obama and McCain are 'unusually talented  and qualified' candidates, but it questioned McCain's choice of  Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate  because she is 'not ready to be president.'      Speaking at a lively rally in Miami, McCain said Joe  Wurzelbacher, of Holland, Ohio, was being punished for asking  Obama a legitimate question.      'Last weekend, Sen. Obama showed up in Joe's driveway to  ask for his vote, and you know what Joe did? He asked Senator  Obama a tough question. I'm glad he did; I think Senator Obama  could use a few more tough questions,' McCain said.      'He wasn't recruited or prompted by our campaign. He just  asked a question. And Americans ought to be able to ask Senator  Obama tough questions without being smeared and targeted with  political attacks,' he said.      Democrats have been sharply critical of Wurzelbacher in the  days since 'Joe the Plumber' questioned Obama's plan to tax  Americans making more than $250,000 a year.           MCCAIN: 'HOLD ONTO YOUR WALLET'      The tax question prompted Obama to say he wanted to 'spread  the wealth around,' a comment that McCain and Republicans have  jumped on as a sign that the Democrat would pursue income  redistribution policies if elected.      Obama and McCain brought up Joe the Plumber more than two  dozen times at a debate on Wednesday night. Wurzelbacher's  brush with fame has come at a cost. The New York Times reported  that Wurzelbacher does not have a plumber's license and owes  back taxes.      The Arizona senator ridiculed Obama's remark about  spreading the wealth, saying, 'When politicians talk about  taking your money and spreading it around, you'd better hold  onto your wallet.'      Obama, trying to blunt McCain's appeal in retiree-haven  Florida, told about 8,000 supporters that McCain's health care  proposal to give Americans a $5,000 tax credit to help pay for  health insurance would require taxing health benefits, and  cutting the Medicare insurance program for seniors by $882  billion.      'If you count on Medicare, it would mean fewer places to  get care, and less freedom to choose your own doctors. You'll  pay more for your drugs, receive fewer services, and get lower  quality care. I don't think that's right,' Obama said.      McCain economic adviser Doug Holtz-Eakin charged that Obama  has 'consistently lied' about McCain's health care plan.      Holtz-Eakin said McCain's tax credit 'will not only shield  millions of families from a tax increase, but will actually  give them more dollars to invest in their health care needs.'      'The McCain plan does not tax medical expenses like the  cost of a pro",

      "Text": "    By Andy Sullivan      WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Barack Obama and John McCain  may have turned him into the most famous small-business owner  in America, but Joe the Plumber isn't about to return the favor  with an endorsement.      The morning after he emerged as the unexpected star of  Wednesday night's presidential debate, Joe Wurzelbacher of  Holland, Ohio, declined to say who he will vote for in the Nov.  4 election.      'It's a personal decision, and myself and the button I push  will know the answer,' the 34-year-old plumber said on ABC's  'Good Morning America' program.      Wurzelbacher came to prominence last week when he asked  Obama about his tax plan during a campaign stop, which led to  an appearance on a Fox News talk show and an invitation to a  McCain rally.      Wurzelbacher said the sudden attention hasn't yet  translated into increased business.      'I hope I have a lot of jobs today. Yesterday I worked on a  water main break for a gas station and that's why I didn't give  any interviews. I was muddy and soaking wet,' he said.      Obama and McCain repeatedly invoked Wurzelbacher in their  final debate as they sought to appeal to average Americans.  McCain, a Republican, said Obama's plan to raise taxes on those  making more than $250,000 a year would hurt small-business  owners like Wurzelbacher.      Obama, a Democrat, said he would make it easier for  Wurzelbacher to provide health insurance for his employees.      Wurzelbacher told ABC he's 'not even close' to earning  $250,000, but worried that Obama would increase taxes for those  making less.      In a video interview with the Toledo Blade newspaper after  the debate, Wurzelbacher described himself as a man of modest  means.      'You see my house. I don't have a lot of bells and whistles  in here, really. My truck's a couple of years old and I'm going  to have it for the next 10 years, probably. So I don't see him  (Obama) helping me out.'      He said he wasn't swayed by Obama's health-care pitch,  either, describing it as 'just one more step toward  socialism.'      Wurzelbacher said he was pleased with McCain's performance.  'McCain came across with some solid points, and I was real  happy about that,' he said.

      "Text": "This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity & Colmes,\" October 17, 2008. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nSEAN HANNITY, CO-HOST: There you have it. With just 18 days away from election day, and the newest political star, Joe the plumber, is seeing the dirty side of politics. Joe, an Ohio plumber, became a household name after he questioned Barack Obama's tax plan. Now, since then he's been criticized about everything, from not having a plumber's license to owing money in back taxes, and today Senator McCain defended Joe at a rally in Florida.\n\nLet's take a listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R-AZ), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The response from Senator Obama and his campaign yesterday was to attack Joe \u2014 was to attack Joe. People are digging \u2014 people are digging through his personal life, and he has TV crews camped out in front of his house. He didn't ask Senator Obama to come to his house. He wasn't \u2014 he wasn't recruited or prompted by our campaign. He just asked a question.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Joining us now is the cofounder of Real Clear Politics, Tom Bevan, and radio talk show host Dennis Prager will be joining us in a minute, and also joining us, Obama supporter Michael Brown.\n\nAll right. Now before we get to anything here, it's \u2014 all he did was ask a question. Now he's had a full background check and smear and attack and besmirched, this poor guy.\n\nLet's watch as Biden and Obama mock him, and listen to the laughing in the crowd as we play this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. BARACK OBAMA (D-IL), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He's trying to suggest that a plumber is the guy he's fighting for. How many plumbers do you know making a quarter million dollars a year?\n\nSEN. JOE BIDEN (D-DE), VICE-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: John continues to cling to the notion, the fact that this guy, Joe the plumber. I don't know how many Joe the plumbers in my neighborhood that make $250,000 a year and are worried.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: I think to attack this man who asked a simple question, that if he starts a business, you know, and to mock him and let the crowd mock him and to let the media investigate him, you know, didn't pay back taxes, this is so fundamentally despicable.\n\nWhy can't you as a Democrat say you know what? Leave Joe, the plumber alone. He's out there swinging a wrench for 12 hours a day, probably six or seven days a week. Do you think it's unfair what's happening to him?\n\nMICHAEL BROWN, OBAMA SUPPORTER: Yes, I do, Sean. We and I are probably going to agree on this issue.\n\n\u2022 Video: Watch Sean and Alan's interview\n\nHANNITY: Good for you.\n\nBROWN: Now frankly, it doesn't really matter much. I don't think voters necessarily care, and frankly, Senator Obama and Senator Biden I don't think are really putting that much into it. Clearly, you've taken some snippets.\n\nHANNITY: Snippets? Yes, I know, Jeremiah Wright snippets. Bill Ayers snippets.\n\nBROWN: But at the end of the day \u2014 at the end of the day, Sean, voters don't really matter or care about this particular issue. They do care about \u2014 they do care about the folks who are wondering how they're going to get their next job...\n\nHANNITY: All right. But then why mock \u2014 wait a minute. You can't have it both ways. Here's the difference. And let me go to Tom on this. You can't have it both ways. You can't mock, you know, Joe the plumber...\n\nBROWN: No one's mocking him.\n\nHANNITY: They were mocking \u2014 I don't know any plumber that makes $250,000 a year. The guy wants to own his own business.\n\nAnd Tom, the way I see this race, and maybe \u2014 maybe Sean Hannity is in a different direction than the rest of the country. The guy who had to drop out of college, the guy that was scrubbing pots and pans \u2014 that's me \u2014 when I was 12 years old, you know, trying to make my own way in life, that I was told, \"You need a helping hand, look down at the end of your arm.\" That's your helping hand.\n\nBut what I'm trying to \u2014 I think America has a choice in this election. Either we're going to become European socialists, we're going to be France, and wave the white flag of surrender, and we're going to nationalize health care and we're going to spread, redistribute the wealth, that's our patriotic duty, or we're going to be Americans with individual responsibility. Is that a fair choice that I'm outlining for the American people?\n\nTOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Well, I mean that's the distinction, the contrast that John McCain has been trying to draw with Obama, the sort of traditional liberal-conservative. But he's been terribly ineffective at it until Joe the plumber came along and served as a sort of vehicle in asking this question.\n\nBecause the fundamental issue here is not Joe the plumber or even the question he asked. It's really Obama's response, spreading the wealth around. McCain's been able to key off that to his advantage, I think, over the last couple of days.\n\nALAN COLMES, CO-HOST: Tom and Michael \u2014 Michael, McCain and Biden \u2014 I should say Biden and Obama were not mocking Joe the plumber. They were mocking John McCain \u2014 excuse me. They were mocking John McCain and his use of Joe the plumber and trying to hold this guy up. John McCain vetted Joe the plumber about as well as he vetted Sarah Palin. That's what the problem is.\n\nBROWN: And you know...\n\nHANNITY: That's a cheap shot against Sarah Palin.\n\nCOLMES: No, it's not against Sarah Palin, Sean. It's against John McCain's lack of vetting of a candidate and a bad choice for a vice- presidential...\n\nHANNITY: She's the most popular governor in the country.\n\nCOLMES: You've got a \u2014 we don't need the guests on. We're going to go at it now. You've got a bunch of conservatives going after Sarah Palin. You've got Kathleen Parky (ph). You've got, you know, a whole bunch of conservatives...\n\nHANNITY: Two people.\n\nCOLMES: ... going after and saying she shouldn't be on the ticket. But that's not the issue here. The issue is Joe the plumber, Michael, and it wasn't he who was being \u2014 that was not the target of the comments of Barack Obama and Joe Biden. He wasn't vetted properly by the McCain campaign.\n\nBROWN: Well, I would bet the McCain campaign now are talking about Joe the plumber as much as possible, because any time they can get off the issues that matter to the American people, they think that's a winner for them. Any time they can do distraction politics, they think that's a winner for them.\n\nSo Joe the plumber, you're going to hear about that from John McCain and Sarah Palin for quite a while now.\n\nBut Barack Obama and Joe Biden are going to focus on things that matter.\n\nCOLMES: Also Tom \u2014 yes.\n\nBROWN: Education, gas prices, the economy, foreign policy. Those are things that really matter now to people, not Joe the plumber. I'm sure he's a nice guy and he shouldn't be slandered.\n\nCOLMES: He's probably a great guy and works very, very hard.\n\nBROWN: But Sean, that's a very small issue.\n\nCOLMES: And Tom, you know, this is a guy who, it turns out, is not a swing voter. He's not an independent. He's a registered Republican. He's not a licensed plumber.\n\nAnd, in fact, forget about McCain or anybody else here, you've got the \u2014 or Obama or Biden throwing him down the stairs. You've got the head of his local union saying he's not licensed, he didn't take training, and he shouldn't be calling himself a plumber. That's the head of his union there, not anybody in a political campaign.\n\nBEVAN: But Alan, that's not necessarily the issue. And the idea that the McCain campaign would have to vet a private citizen for asking questions is somewhat ridiculous.\n\nAnd now you've got a situation where you've got John McCain out there defending this guy, who happens to be a working class guy from Ohio. He may not be a swing voter. He may be, you know, a conservative, but that's not the issue. The atmospherics of it are, that you've got McCain defending those kind of voters, and Obama's now kind of mocking them or making fun of them.\n\nCOLMES: Well, I think he's not making \u2014 again, I think he's making fun of McCain for using them, not for the guy himself. But thank you very much for being with us, both of you.\n\nWatch \"Hannity & Colmes\" weeknights at 9 p.m. ET!\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2008 FOX News Network, Inc. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

'I just exploded,' the 37-year-old plumber told the court.  The man, who admitted his guilt, said his girlfriend had  recently moved out and left behind 'Popeye', a 2-year-old black  and white cat.      He had just returned from a nearby bar and got angry at the  cat for making a mess, the court heard.      'The crime was especially barbaric,' Judge Monika Pelcz told  the court after sentencing the man to jail without probation,  according to a report in Der Tagesspiegel newspaper on Thursday.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nWatch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET and listen to the \"Radio Factor!\"\n\nBILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the \"Is It Legal?\" segment tonight: You may remember the state of Ohio investigated Joe the plumber soon after he began campaigning for John McCain. At first it was just Joe's child support payments, but then we found out the investigation into Joe was far more extensive.\n\nSo we sent Jesse Watters to Ohio to talk with the director of the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services, Helen Jones-Kelley, who's responsible for the Joe snooping. Well, when Ms. Kelley saw Jesse, she ran into a fire station, and then the police chief showed up.\n\nClick here to watch the confrontation.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: If your intention in going inside the fire station is to trap her in a room and talk to her, that's not going to happen.\n\nJESSE WATTERS, \"FACTOR\" PRODUCER: I don't want to trap her. I just want to convey...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: How much clearer can I make it that she doesn't want to talk to you? Does she \u2014 do you have to make her talk to you? Is that your right to make her talk to you?\n\nWATTERS: What I'm saying is she's \u2014 her salary is paid for by the taxpayers. She maxed out to the Obama campaign. She may have done something illegal. And as a journalist, I have a right to ask her a question.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, not if she doesn't want to speak with you.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO'REILLY: Well, after that confrontation, Jesse finally did get to speak with Ms. Kelley off camera.\n\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\n\nWATTERS: Did the governor order you to go into the file, or was that a decision that you made?\n\nHELEN JONES-KELLY, OHIO STATE WORKER: I'm going to say again, if you have any questions you need to speak to Tom Charles who is the inspector general of the state of Ohio.\n\nWATTERS: OK, all right, thanks for your time.\n\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\n\nO'REILLY: With us now, our \"Is it Legal?\" team, attorney and FOX News analyst Lis Wiehl and attorney and FOX News anchor Megyn Kelly. No relation to...\n\nMEGYN KELLY, \"AMERICA'S NEWSROOM\" CO-HOST: She spells it with a second \"e.\"\n\nO'REILLY: Now, at first it was just the child support payments. But the state of Ohio went far beyond that, correct?\n\nKELLY: Yes. Now we have news that they looked into whether he was on welfare and getting any sort of welfare checks, and they also looked into whether he owed any back taxes. And now we have reports that, separate and apart from Helen Jones-Kelley's department, they checked his DMV records and perhaps other records. We don't know exactly how widespread it was, but the government of Ohio looked into Joe the plumber and looked hard.\n\nO'REILLY: Anything illegal about that?\n\nKELLY: Well, it's not that it's illegal, it's that it's inappropriate and unethical. This woman defended her snooping by saying, \"Well, he suddenly shot to stardom. He came into the public eye.\" That's not enough. That cannot be enough. You must have to have some sort of reason to look into somebody's records. Even she admits that. And she tried to pawn off that reason as saying, \"Well, he came into the public eye.\"\n\nO'REILLY: Do you think she was ordered to do it?\n\nKELLY: I have no evidence of that.\n\nO'REILLY: See, I believe she was.\n\nKELLY: I know you do.\n\nO'REILLY: Because she's not smart enough, with all due respect, to do it on her own.\n\nKELLY: Why? Where do you get that? Here's why I...\n\nO'REILLY: Because I \u2014 we've investigated.\n\nKELLY: ...would argue the opposite. Here's why I would argue the opposite. She maxed out, as Jesse Watters pointed out, to the Obama campaign. She's clearly an Obama supporter.\n\nO'REILLY: She's in the machine.\n\nKELLY: But listen, everyone in the left wanted dirt on Joe the plumber when he first came out on the national scene.\n\nO'REILLY: Right.\n\nKELLY: All the left blogs were trying to find out about his tax liens and so on.\n\nO'REILLY: I think a bureaucrat like that would...\n\nKELLY: I mean, she may have just been lucky.\n\nO'REILLY: But anyway, look, Wiehl, if I'm living in the state of New York and somebody doesn't like me in Albany...\n\nLIS WIEHL, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Really? Shocked. I'm shocked. Somebody not like you?\n\nO'REILLY: It might be happening. Do they have a right \u2014 they don't...\n\nWIEHL: Absolutely not. And I disagree with Megyn in the sense I do think there is potentially something illegal here. I looked at the Ohio legislative statutes, and employees are strictly liable for misuse of political funds. And I would say, look, her taking the time or ordering somebody else to take the time to look into this, that's misuse of public funds. It takes time and money to do that.\n\nO'REILLY: Because her agency is paid for by the taxpayers.\n\nWIEHL: Absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nO'REILLY: So she'd have to justify the expense?\n\nWIEHL: The reason she justified it, she said, \"Well, when people come into the political eye, like a lottery winner, then we're going to look at them.\" Well, a lottery winner is a lot different from somebody....\n\nO'REILLY: So you would launch an investigation?\n\nWIEHL: They have. They have launched an investigation on her.\n\nO'REILLY: There is one?\n\nWIEHL: On her \u2014 not \u2014 on her\u2026\n\nO'REILLY: The attorney general of Ohio?\n\nWIEHL: An investigation. But all they said today is it's ongoing.\n\nO'REILLY: They're all Democrats, you know. And I'm not saying that Democrats are corrupt. I'm just saying that, you know, like Ohio, any state, there's a lot of cronyism.\n\nNow, where is the ACLU in this? Aren't they the privacy people?\n\nKELLY: This is a shocker, isn't it?\n\nO'REILLY: They didn't show up. Where is the ACLU?\n\nKELLY: They are out in California on behalf of the gay marriage advocates.\n\nO'REILLY: So they're over in that \u2014 they couldn't help Joe the plumber.\n\nKELLY: Yes.\n\nO'REILLY: Don't they have bathrooms at the ACLU? Don't they have restrooms there on the premises? Don't they like plumbers?\n\nKELLY: The ACLU would absolutely be involved in this. This is tailor made for the ACLU.\n\nO'REILLY: Can you imagine if a Republican did this to a Democrat? It's unbelievable.\n\nKELLY: Outrage.\n\nO'REILLY: But nothing. No ACLU. We haven't seen any of them.\n\nWIEHL: No, they are all in California doing the whole gay marriage thing.\n\nO'REILLY: All in California.\n\nWIEHL: It takes a lot to file all these lawsuits in California.\n\nO'REILLY: All right. Let's get this. Let's get this. So we want to say, there's no ACLU in Ohio helping Joe the plumber.\n\nWIEHL: Even though there is a huge privacy issue. I'm sure they're going to step in and help Jesse if he gets sued, too.\n\nO'REILLY: The folks in California say no to gay marriage, overturning the Supreme Court. That should be it, right?\n\nKELLY: Yes, that should be it. It is a ballot initiative. And that's how you amend the constitution in California, by a ballot initiative.\n\nBut the supporters of gay marriage have now filed three lawsuits, and their argument is there's a difference between amending the constitution and revising it altogether. In other words, gutting it. And this thing essentially guts it. And it's true that you can't gut it by a ballot initiative. So what the fight is going to be over, is this a normal amendment that we've seen them pass many times, or is this essentially a gutting of the constitution?\n\nO'REILLY: What do you think, Wiehl?\n\nWIEHL: Well, the problem is that the supreme court, the California Supreme Court already ruled on exactly this language. I compared the language in the decision to the language of the amendment, and it's exactly word by word.\n\nO'REILLY: Because they tried to keep this off the ballot, right?\n\nWIEHL: Exactly.\n\nO'REILLY: So they lost and the Supreme Court said you can't have it on the ballot.\n\nWIEHL: Right.\n\nO'REILLY: So now they're going back again with the same argument.\n\nWIEHL: But it was a 4-3 decision the last time. So the question is...\n\nO'REILLY: Maybe they can get somebody else.\n\nWIEHL: But here's the thing. Even if they win at the California level...\n\nO'REILLY: The Supreme Court.\n\nWIEHL: ...which means it goes to the Supreme Court. Does the ACLU really want to open that door?\n\nO'REILLY: Sure they do.\n\nWIEHL: No, they don't.\n\nKELLY: It doesn't go to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nWIEHL: It's a constitutional issue.\n\nKELLY: It's a state constitutional issue, which means...\n\nO'REILLY: Say the loons in Sacramento, the judges, side with the gay activists and say, you know, \"We're going to throw this vote out\"? Then you know the other side is going to appeal it further. And it does...\n\nKELLY: You can't, no. When it's a matter of state constitutional law, the state supreme court is the ultimate arbiter on it. And the gay marriage proponents have been very careful not to raise federal issues, because they don't want it winding up in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nO'REILLY: So the judges could just throw this whole thing out?\n\nKELLY: Yes.\n\nO'REILLY: Based on nothing but the judges want to do it.\n\nKELLY: Well, this is what they \u2014 this is what they would say. They would say it did gut the state constitution, because it gutted the equal protection clause.\n\nO'REILLY: But Wiehl pointed out, they approved the language.\n\nWIEHL: Exactly the same language. So I don't \u2014 unless they can make that one vote sway, I think we're going to get the very same decision. And what I would argue, if I was trying to get this to the Supreme Court, then I would say, \"Look, there is a federal constitutional issue. It's equal protection issue, even though it comes up in the state constitution.\" I know it's a stretch, but that's what I would argue.\n\nO'REILLY: I am starting to get a headache.\n\nKELLY: The final line is the California Supreme Court controls\u2026\n\nO'REILLY: All I want people to know is, when you're sitting between two women who went to law school, you must have aspirin.\n\nLadies, thanks very much. I appreciate it.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2008 FOX News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

      "Text": "This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity & Colmes,\" October 20, 2008. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nSEAN HANNITY, CO-HOST: And meanwhile the biggest story in the \u2014 in last week on the campaign has been, well, the man that America has come to know as Joe the Plumber. His real name is Samuel Joe Wurzelbacher. And he has become the new symbol of the McCain campaign's fight for everyday Americans.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOHN MCCAIN, (R) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Now I'd like to ask one other thing that I have not before. On behalf of Joe, the plumber, and Rose, the teacher, and Phil, the brick layer, and Wendy, the waitress, and all small business people around America, will small business people please raise their hands so we can thank you for what you do for America, job creation?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: And Hannity, the hot head, and Colmes the calm \u2014 I'm sorry. I'm just kidding. It was a joke.\n\nCOLMES: I'm just Alan the talk show host.\n\nHANNITY: All right. And he's even been the target of the Obama-Biden campaign as well.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He's trying to suggest that \u2014 a plumber is the guy he's fighting for.\n\n(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: How many plumbers do you know making $250,000 a year?\n\nJOE BIDEN, (D) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: John continues to cling to the notion (INAUDIBLE) the fact this guy Joe, the plumber. I don't know many Joe, the plumbers in my neighborhood that make that $250,000 a year are worried.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: All right, Joe the Plumber joins us in our studio. It's actually Samuel J., not.\n\nJOE WURZELBACHER, 'JOE THE PLUBER': Yes, Samuel J. Wurzelbacher.\n\nVideo: Watch Sean and Alan's interview with 'Joe the Plumber'\n\nHANNITY: Well, Joe, you're a great American. Good to see you, my friend.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes, thank you very much.\n\nHANNITY: Thank you for being here. We appreciate it.\n\nYou know, first of all, you had never seen that before?\n\nWURZELBACHER: No, no. That was the first time really.\n\nHANNITY: What do you \u2014 when you hear \u2014 first of all, it made me mad for you because the crowd's laughing, they think this is a big joke.\n\nYou know, here, you're swinging a wrench 12, 14 hours a day. And by the way, I had a lot of years in construction.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: Ask Alec Baldwin. He made fun of me. But you know, you're swinging a wrench. You're installing toilets and showers and plumbing and heating and making people's lives better. You service some people, earning every dollar you get.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: And to be laughed out, I didn't think that was funny.\n\nWURZELBACHER: No. I don't think it's really funny. I mean, you know, he just trying to take \u2014 trying \u2014 you know the fact that \u2014 well, the issues, I mean he just wants to, you know, take the attention off the issues and kind of play with me, and that way he doesn't have to explain anything.\n\nHANNITY: For the \u2014 for the record, you were playing football with your son. You didn't go to an Obama rally. He walked down your street.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: Take us from there. What happened?\n\nWURZELBACHER: Just \u2014 yes, like you said. I was tossing the football with my son, he's walking down the street \u2014 I'm sorry, he's canvassing the neighborhood, going back and forth, and he's getting closer and closer, and you know, it actually irritated me.\n\nI didn't really want to talk with him, you know? I wanted to toss football with my son.\n\nHANNITY: Right.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Something that we'd do.\n\nHANNITY: I don't want to talk to Colmes a lot of nights either.\n\nCOLMES: But you get paid well to do it, don't you?\n\nHANNITY: Ah \u2014 yes.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHANNITY: Short answer. Yes.\n\nWURZELBACHER: So you know, short story, as they were asking me easy questions. And you know, you know, everybody in America thinks, man, god, if I could get this guy in front of me, I'd really \u2014 you know ask him a hard question.\n\nWell, I had the chance. And you know, my question wasn't that hard.\n\nHANNITY: No.\n\nWURZELBACHER: It's just he shot himself in his own foot with his answer.\n\nHANNITY: All right. Here's the \u2014 because this is now, we have Joe Biden say it's our \u2014 saying it's our patriotic duty to pay more taxes. He's saying \u2014 he said to you, and this \u2014 this is resonating, spread the wealth.\n\nAnd there are even people, according to the Obama plan, who don't work or pay taxes that will get money back.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: And if you say the word welfare, some of \u2014 said well, that's actually racist. Actually that came out this weekend.\n\nHere's my question to you. Why is \u2014 in your words, because I thought you articulated this better than many politicians. Why do you view this as socialism because that's the word you used?\n\nWURZELBACHER: Well, just because, you know, when you work hard, I mean, all your life, you've \u2014 you've said, you know, work hard, you'll make something of yourself. You know? I grew up poor. You know I actually have been on welfare, you know, my parents, you know, a couple different times, and we'd, you know, worked harder and got off of it and then, you know, actually did fairly well.\n\nI mean fairly well, you know, I'm not talking $100,000 a year fairly well, I'm just talking fairly well for us. You know? So when someone tells me that if you work hard that we're going to take more away from you, what's the purpose of working hard?\n\nHANNITY: Do you think this should be a defining moment? Because I actually believe that it is a defining moment in the campaign. It's going to be very interesting. Because Barack Obama's promised to spend $1 trillion more in tax money, that means your tax dollars out there, $1 trillion more.\n\nBarack Obama says he's going to raise the capital gains tax, put a windfall profit tax on companies, raise tax rates, eliminate the Bush tax cuts.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: . and raise a series of taxes, the death tax among them.\n\nThat's socialism. That is redistribution of wealth.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: Why do you think that's bad? Why would that be bad for you if you're going to try to get this business of yours?\n\nWURZELBACHER: There's no reason to go out there and work hard. There's no more \u2014 you know, I mean, he's breeding mediocrity in America is what he's doing by doing all that.\n\nI mean, people, you know, at one point in time they wanted a hand up maybe, but now it's a hand out. You're \u2014 telling people to stay home, I'm going to take care of you, and the other people that are working out there, they're just.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCOLMES: Hey, Joe, nice to meet you. Thanks for (INAUDIBLE) on the show.\n\nHANNITY: If you want a helping hand, it's at the end of your arm. That's what Michael (INAUDIBLE) said.\n\nCOLMES: First of all, were you an undecided voter, truly, when you met Barack Obama?\n\nWURZELBACHER: No. No, I was not an undecided voter.\n\nCOLMES: Because they \u2014 it was presented that way. And you know, I think a lot of people \u2014 I don't think some of the comments that you may have felt insulted by were directed at you personally, as much as people like (INAUDIBLE) have genuine issues with the McCain campaign and McCain's policies.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes.\n\nCOLMES: Do you think that Joe Biden and John McCain were personally attacking you?\n\nHANNITY: Joe Biden and Barack Obama.\n\nCOLMES: Well, what did I say? Oh Barack \u2014 excuse me, right. Thank you for helping me with the question, Hannity.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Well, Joe Biden, I mean, he said it awful mockingly. You know I don't know any to \u2014 you know, and I do kind of take that a little personal. I mean I didn't say I made $250,000. You know I think he's making more of it.\n\nCOLMES: But it wasn't about you, it was this idea that if you're making less than that, you're going to actually save money under Barack Obama's tax policies, you wouldn't be paying more.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Well, you know, yes, I thought about that, and I was hoping you might ask something like that.\n\nCOLMES: Yes.\n\nWURZELBACHER: To be honest with you. You know I don't think it's right to \u2014 you know, you know, there's principles involved. I don't want to make or have my taxes cut if it means somebody who worked hard or had a better break than I did, and take his money. I don't want his money.\n\nCOLMES: So you don't want a tax cut?\n\nWURZELBACHER: I don't want someone else's money who worked hard for it. No.\n\nCOLMES: But John McCain will have tax cuts, too, for some people, for the middle-class Americans. It wouldn't be just Barack Obama.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Oh no, it's, I mean \u2014 well, you know, are \u2014 either one of them going to do it.\n\nCOLMES: I want to address this issue of socialism. You raised the issue of socialism.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes.\n\nCOLMES: I want to play you a little tape here of what the various candidates have said about that and the whole issue of socialism.\n\nLet's take a look.\n\nWURZELBACHER: All right.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSARAH PALIN, (R) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The key to Barack Obama's tax plan, since he can't reduce taxes on those who pay zero, he wants the government to send them a check that's called a tax credit. And.\n\n(BOOS)\n\nMCCAIN: I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit.\n\nPALIN: But Joe the plumber and Ed the dairyman \u2014 I believe that they think that it sounds more like socialism.\n\n(CHEERS)\n\nMCCAIN: Under my orders as president of the United States government will purchase mortgages directly from homeowners and mortgage services and replace them.\n\nPALIN: Friends, now is no time to experiment with socialism.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCOLMES: That's interesting because Sarah Palin gave $1200 to every resident of Alaska, some people would call that socialism. And John McCain would give.\n\nHANNITY: That was their oil money.\n\nCOLMES: And Sam, and Sam.\n\nHANNITY: That was their oil money.\n\nCOLMES: And every year \u2014 excuse me. Every year Alaskans get $2,000.\n\nHANNITY: You're picking on Joe the Plumber on oil issues?\n\nCOLMES: Excuse me. I believe I'm.\n\nHANNITY: Go ahead.\n\nCOLMES: I believe I'm up now.\n\nHANNITY: I'm defending my friend.\n\nCOLMES: Forgive me. Forgive me for being, you know.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that, you know, one could say socialism when John McCain wants to buy back mortgages. Is that socialism?\n\nWURZELBACHER: You know, honestly, I don't know enough.\n\nCOLMES: Right.\n\nWURZELBACHER: . to actually answer that question intelligently, but at the same, I mean, as far as \u2014 you know, that is oil money, that's not socialism, that's just rewarding the people in the state.\n\nCOLMES: Right.\n\nWURZELBACHER: I mean I lived up in Alaska for a couple of years. I was, you know, lucky enough to receive that, you know, at one point. But, you know, if you're a resident and you pay, because I mean, food is more expensive up there because it has to be trucked in there. There's a lot of things.\n\nSo socialist, no. As far as \u2014 you know, here's a question back at you. Why do they keep on saying 95 percent of Americans? 95 percent of Americans don't pay taxes.\n\nCOLMES: They're saying 95 percent of working families.\n\nHANNITY: Wait, I got to (INAUDIBLE) one thing before we go to break.\n\nCOLMES: He's saying.\n\nHANNITY: When we come back we're going to talk about the vicious, vicious personal attacks against you. So we've got one more segment.\n\nCOLMES: Nobody supports vicious personal attacks or any attacks against you personally.\n\nBut by the way, he's talking 95 percent.\n\nHANNITY: He tries to give you this edited sound bite.\n\nCOLMES: He's talking about \u2014 excuse me. Excuse me.\n\nHANNITY: Yes, sir.\n\nCOLMES: He's talking about \u2014 may I speak?\n\nHANNITY: No.\n\nCOLMES: He's talking about 95 percent of working families, not 95 percent of Americans.\n\nWe'll be back with Joe the Plumber.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nCOLMES: And we're back with Joe the Plumber. You know we have a great country where we can disagree.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes.\n\nCOLMES: About stuff. And I guess, getting back to this issue of where you would do better, do you think you'd do better under John McCain than Barack Obama even if you're making under $250,000 a year and you're not being taxed on that amount of money?\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes, I do.\n\nCOLMES: Why would that be if you would actually, say, maybe $1,000 or $2,000 a year under the Obama tax plan?\n\nWURZELBACHER: Because, I mean, you start bending principles, then where does it stop? I do think it's an issue with principles. I mean it's not right to take someone else's money who has worked, you know, harder or has better breaks, like I was saying last time. I just wouldn't feel comfortable with that.\n\nCOLMES: Yes. But we have a progressive tax system in this country where those who have made more, traditionally, have always paid more higher percentage, and a lot of people might like a flat tax, which sounds a lot fairer.\n\nWURZELBACHER: A lot would love flat tax.\n\nCOLMES: But it doesn't seem like we're headed in that direction. But even under Reagan and even under Bush \u2014 both Bushes we've had a \u2014 what's called a progressive tax cuts.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Well, you know, I asked Obama about the flat tax.\n\nCOLMES: Yes.\n\nWURZELBACHER: I mean he threw out a number of 40 percent, and I, you know, that was kind of high, then he \u2014 you know, he did back off, said about 22 or 23 percent, and that's to keep the government at the \u2014 you know, how big it is right now.\n\nCOLMES: Right. Right.\n\nWURZELBACHER: I mean, really, the government needs to be cut in half. I mean there's so many expenditures out there. I mean you know, embryo research, I mean just so many things.\n\nCOLMES: Sure.\n\nWURZELBACHER: That should be privatized, that shouldn't be anything the government's.\n\nCOLMES: Sure.\n\nWURZELBACHER: You know? And so, you know, if we could get rid of a lot of the government which, you know, Sarah Palin's talked a lot about, you know.\n\nCOLMES: Well, one of the thing we're starting to get rid off is, for example, the military, we need defense, and also one of the things Obama said he would do would get us out of Iraq which would save a lot of money in terms of the money we're spending in that war.\n\nWURZELBACHER: You know, I'm \u2014 well, as far as that goes, have you met anybody over there?\n\nCOLMES: Sure.\n\nWURZELBACHER: You know, they've got liberation, they've got freedom. Things that we take for granted on a daily basis.\n\nCOLMES: But there's a price that comes with that.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Well, sure, there's a price with...\n\nCOLMES: You know, we're not asked to sacrifice anything here in this \u2014 you know we have \u2014 there has been no sacrifices asked of Americans.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes, but we send all our money over to \u2014 you know major disasters happen worldwide, I mean we send out money over there without \u2014 you know so we're being great Americans.\n\nCOLMES: Sure.\n\nWURZELBACHER: We're being great Americans now.\n\nCOLMES: But the price of that has maybe some people who make a lot of money paying more taxes to able to afford to give freedom to those countries, you think that's we've been doing?\n\nHANNITY: Hey, Joe, you see what I have to put up with? Do you think you have stress wringing that wrench around every day? You know?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nListen, I got some news for you.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: Scott Rasmussen, who is our pollster, is going to join us in a few minutes. He's got the latest state by state polls.\n\nYou've been polled.\n\nWURZELBACHER: I've been polled?\n\nHANNITY: Yes. And by the way, among those that are following your story, you have a 58 percent approval rating. All right? Among.\n\nCOLMES: When are you running?\n\nHANNITY: By the way, 37 percent \u2014 disapproval rating, 71 percent of Republicans approve of everything you're doing and then 64 percent of Alan's left-wing socialist friends don't like you.\n\nCOLMES: Please throw in the word communist while you're at it.\n\nHANNITY: Close thing.\n\nWURZELBACHER: I believe in \u2014 no, not socialism.\n\nI believe in social issues. I believe in social works. I mean I think it needs reforming something fierce. You know I have friends, you know, that, you know, make so much money, but if they make just a couple dollars more?\n\nHANNITY: Yes, the government is picking their pocket.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Well, not only picking their pocket, but they're taking their child support away.\n\nHANNITY: Absolutely.\n\nWURZELBACHER: They're taking \u2014 you know, I mean, childcare away. They're taking the food away. I mean, you know, so you don't really \u2014 you're not wanting them to succeed, you're penalizing them.\n\nHANNITY: All right. I want to talk about, you know, the left wing, and this is not Alan, in fairness to him, but there have been vicious attacks. You don't have a license. Joe doesn't \u2014 Joe doesn't have license. You've been a master plumber for how many years?\n\nWURZELBACHER: I'm not a master plumber. I'm just a plumber.\n\nHANNITY: You're a plumber, but you work under the license of your boss?\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes. I work under the license of my boss.\n\nHANNITY: And you \u2014 and you went to school three and a half years, you have six months left to go to get your own master's plumber?\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes. I'm going to bypass the journeyman.\n\nHANNITY: Right.\n\nWURZELBACHER: And I'm going to take my test and get my master's license. That way I can.\n\nHANNITY: So you never did illegal? In other words, when the implications was, you're not even a real plumber. You've been doing this for 15 years.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: Yes. All right, the other thing that people have been out there saying, well, you didn't pay their taxes.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: You didn't even know that there was a bill.\n\nWURZELBACHER: They don't send notices out. You know?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWURZELBACHER: And the only way you find out is if you \u2014 you know, go to refinance your house.\n\nHANNITY: Yes.\n\nWURZELBACHER: . or you're going to sell it or, you know, or try to get a loan off it, then all of the sudden, hey, you know, it raises its ugly head.\n\nHANNITY: Right. I want to say \u2014 but the \u2014 you see, none of this was relevant, but once your message began to resonate.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: . it was attack the messenger and forget about \u2014 it was Barack Obama, he's the one running for president who said, you know, spread the wealth around, and we'll run it through, of course, him and his bureaucracy and Biden and his bureaucracy.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: And they don't want to \u2014 what is that \u2014 what did that teach you about this system?\n\nWURZELBACHER: We'd go a little further as far as.\n\nHANNITY: Smear \u2014 smear the messenger, don't pay attention to the question which was relevant.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Well, you know, that bothers me, that they have to spend so much time on me. I mean I am really your just \u2014 your average Joe.\n\nI mean, you know, come November 4th, I mean, someone's going to have to go to work, and they're really going to have a tough job ahead of them, and they're going to sit here and talk about, you know, if I have a license or if I have a \u2014 you know, I owe $1100? I mean, you know, these guys will (INAUDIBLE).\n\nHANNITY: Yes. I want to tell you one thing. I did \u2014 I have beaten you, though. I have a higher disapproval rating among Democrats than you do. So.\n\nCOLMES: They know you better.\n\nHANNITY: That's true. Just give me some time.\n\nJoe, you're a great American. Thank you for all you do honestly. It's a.\n\nWURZELBACHER: Thank you very much really. Appreciate it.\n\nCOLMES: Very nice to meet you, Joe.\n\nWURZELBACHER: That was (INAUDIBLE).\n\nHANNITY: You know what? You're the heart and soul swinging that wrench, you're the heart and soul of what makes this country great, and the fact that you had this opportunity, I think, speaks volumes about you and this country.\n\nThank you for being with us. Honestly.\n\nWURZELBACHER: I really appreciate it.\n\nWatch \"Hannity & Colmes\" weeknights at 9 p.m. ET!\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2008 FOX News Network, Inc. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

      "Text": "    HOUSTON, June 3 (Reuters) - After more than a year of  training, a rocket ride to space and a two-day journey to reach  the International Space Station, the shuttle Discovery crew  floated into the orbital outpost with these words:      'Someone call a plumber?'      Someone had. With the $100 billion space station's sole  toilet on the blink, NASA made room aboard shuttle Discovery  for a new pump, which they hope will fix the problem.      'Yeah, we got it,' commander Mark Kelly assured station  flight engineer Garrett Reisman as the two greeted each other  in orbit on Monday.      The scene, captured was replayed on NASA TV early on  Tuesday.      The space station toilet, housed in the Russian-built  Zvezda module, is disposing of solid waste but the urine  collection system is not working properly. Every three flushes  or so it must be manually flushed with water, which takes two  crew members about 10 minutes.      While Discovery is docked at the space station, 210 miles  (338 km) above Earth, the three space station crew and the  seven visiting astronauts will have access to the shuttle's  toilet.      Repairs to the Russian-made space station commode fall to  station commander Sergei Volkov and flight engineer Oleg  Kononenko. The work is scheduled for Wednesday, NASA said.

      "Text": "    * Obama says 19 days from beginning, not end      * Polls show Obama with edge over McCain      * McCain works Joe the plumber into his stump speech           By John Whitesides, Political Correspondent      NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Democratic presidential  nominee Barack Obama warned his supporters to guard against  overconfidence on Thursday as he and underdog Republican rival  John McCain opened a 19-day sprint to Election Day.      The two candidates hit the campaign trail -- Obama in New  York and New Hampshire and McCain in Pennsylvania -- after  their third and last presidential debate on Wednesday, a testy  face-off that made an Ohio plumber famous.      So far, all the stars seemed to be lining up in Obama's  favor. He leads in national opinion polls and in many of the  battleground states where the Nov. 4 race will be won or lost.      Late on Thursday, The Washington Post delivered an  endorsement of Obama and a rebuke to McCain in an editorial on  its web site (www.washingtonpost.com). The Post, one of  America's most respected newspapers, said its endorsement of  Obama was 'without ambivalence.'      'The choice is made easy in part by Mr. McCain's  disappointing campaign, above all his irresponsible selection  of a running mate who is not ready to be president,' the Post  editors wrote. 'It is made easy in larger part, though, because  of our admiration for Mr. Obama and the impressive qualities he  has shown during this long race.'      A confident but cautious Obama told supporters in New York,  'We are now 19 days not from the end but from the beginning.  The amount of work that's going to be involved for the next  president will be extraordinary.'      Traders betting on future events in the political  prediction markets are overwhelmingly predicting an Obama  victory, giving the Illinois Democrat a better than 80 percent  chance of winning.      Ireland's biggest bookmaker, Paddy Power, was already  declaring Obama the winner. The Dublin-based bookmaker said it  would pay out early more than 1 million euros ($1.35 million)  on bets that Obama will be the next U.S. president.           REMEMBERING NEW HAMPSHIRE      But Obama pointed out to deep-pocket contributors at a  fundraising breakfast in Manhattan, and later to supporters in  a driving rain in Londonderry, New Hampshire, that he was  supposed to win New Hampshire last January in the Democratic  primary but lost the state to Sen. Hillary Clinton.      'We are 19 days away from changing this country -- 19 days.  But for those who are getting a little cocky, I've got two  words for you: New Hampshire. I learned right here that you  can't let up or pay too much attention to the polls,' he said.      In New York, he said, 'I've been in these positions before  when we were favored and the press starts getting carried away  and we end up getting spanked.'      The new star in U.S. politics -- at least for a news cycle  or two -- is Joe Wurzelbacher, 'Joe the plumber,' who told  Obama at a campaign stop that he wanted to buy a small plumbing  business in Holland, Ohio.      Joe came up about two dozen times during the debate as each  candidate argued that their prescriptions for America's  economic ills would help the plumber best.      Wurzelbacher was all over morning television shows and was  not saying who he would vote for, but he sounded like a McCain  backer.      'McCain came across with some solid points, and I was real  happy about that,' he told the ",

      "Text": "    * Obama drops off campaign trail to visit grandmother      * McCain gives strong support to running mate Palin      * Obama hits McCain on corporate tax cut proposal           By Steve Holland      SARASOTA, Fla., Oct 23 (Reuters) - Republican presidential  nominee John McCain took his 'Joe the Plumber' economic message  on a bus ride across Florida on Thursday, accusing Democrat  Barack Obama of backing a tax plan that would endanger the  teetering U.S. economy.      McCain's broadside, delivered at stops throughout central  Florida, prompted Obama to fire back that McCain's economic  proposals would give corporations a tax break for shipping jobs  overseas -- a 'Wall Street first, Main Street last' strategy.      McCain is resting his hopes on instigating a 'Joe the  Plumber' voter uprising against the better-funded Obama by  whipping up populist sentiment over Obama's comment to Ohio  plumber Joe Wurzelbacher that raising taxes on people making  more than $250,000 a year would allow Washington to 'spread the  wealth around.'      Trailing in opinion polls both nationally and in many key  states, McCain, an Arizona senator, is facing an increasingly  difficult path to victory and finds himself racing to defend  states that have voted Republican in recent elections.       With less than two weeks before the Nov. 4 election, Obama  leads McCain 52 percent to 40 percent among likely voters in  the latest three-day tracking poll by Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby.  Other polls showed some signs of a tightening race.      McCain called Obama's plan a redistribution of income and  said it would hurt small businesses that he said have been  doing some of the only hiring at a time when claims for jobless  benefits rose by a larger than expected 15,000 last week.      'Senator Obama may say he's going to soak the rich but it's  the middle class who are going to get wet,' McCain said in  Sarasota.      McCain strongly supported his vice presidential running  mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who has energized the party's  base but has had a difficult introduction to the national  scene, getting mixed reviews for a couple of national  television interviews.      A story on the Politico Web site on Wednesday that the  Republican National Committee spent $150,000 on her wardrobe  only added to the negative picture surrounding the self-styled  hockey mom Palin.      'Can you believe the way she's being attacked? It's really  remarkable,' McCain said to raucous cheers at a rally in  Sarasota. 'I can tell you what, she's far more qualified than  Joe the Biden' -- a reference to Obama's vice presidential  running mate, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware.      Asked about the clothes, McCain told a group of Florida  reporters on his bus that she needed clothes at the time and  that they would be donated to charity, according to WFLA  television.      In Ormond Beach, McCain said it was critical to keep people  facing foreclosure in their homes.      He criticized the Bush administration for not buying  troubled mortgages to allow homeowners facing foreclosure to  get a better interest rate on their loans as part of a $700  billion Wall Street bailout. He complained particularly about  Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.      'Why isn't the secretary of the Treasury ordering them to  do that?' he said.      The New York Times on Thursday endorsed Obama, saying  he 'had drawn in legions of new voters with powerful messages  of hope and possibility and calls for shared sacri",

      "Text": "    MONTEVIDEO, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Uruguayan President Tabare  Vazquez vetoed a law decriminalizing abortions in the first 12  weeks of pregnancy, arguing it violated the right to life, the  office of the presidency said on Friday.      A doctor and center-left leader, Vazquez had repeatedly  vowed to veto the easing of abortion restrictions. Congress  passed the measure earlier this week, in a rare move in  predominantly Roman Catholic Latin America.      In a statement explaining the veto, Vazquez said it was  more important to help women with unwanted pregnancies than to  facilitate abortions for them.      'Our laws cannot ignore the reality of the existence of  human life in the gestation period, as scientific evidence  clearly shows,' the president said.      'It's more appropriate to look for a solution based on  solidarity, giving a woman the freedom to make other choices  and thereby save both her and her baby,' Vazquez said.      Support for the law allowing early abortions was not seen  as strong enough to override the presidential veto.      Abortion is largely banned in Latin America, home to about  half the world's Roman Catholics. In the region, Cuba has the  most permissive laws, and Mexico City allows abortions on  demand in the first trimester of pregnancy.      A congressional committee in Brazil defeated a measure to  legalize the procedure earlier this year.

The protesters, who said they were Protestant and Catholic,  shouted against Chinese policies restricting family sizes and  sometimes imposing forced abortions on women who violate the  rule.      'End the brutality,' one yelled on the Square, which is the  city's symbolic heart. 'To those who are forced to go through  forced abortions and have no voice, we are your voice.'      Police took the protesters away and questioned them on a  nearby bench. Then, unusually for this security-wary country, the  three were allowed to leave, at least for now.      Earlier in the day, two American and two British protesters  were detained after they unfurled banners calling for Tibetan  independence near the main Games stadium, where the Games open on  Friday.      The Games torch also began its relay through the city on  Wednesday.

      "Text": "    By Patricia Avila      MONTEVIDEO, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Uruguay's Senate voted on  Tuesday to decriminalize abortions during the first 12 weeks of  pregnancy, a rare move for a Latin American country, but the  president is expected to kill the measure.      The Senate voted 17 to 13 in favor of the bill after the  lower house of Congress approved it last week in a session that  was interrupted by a bomb threat.      Abortion is largely banned in Latin America, home to about  half the world's Roman Catholics. Uruguay's center-left  president, Tabare Vazquez, has vowed to veto any law easing  restrictions on the procedure.      Congress could override the veto in theory, but support for  the bill is not seen as strong enough for that.      'Whether the president vetoes it or not, it's important  that Congress has established this right,' said ruling party  senator Margarita Percovich, who told Reuters she hopes Vazquez  will change his position.      Under the current law, which dates from 1938, women who  abort and the people who assist them face jail terms. Abortion  is only permitted in cases of rape or when the life of the  woman or the fetus is endangered.      A recent survey by private pollster Interconsult showed 57  percent of Uruguayans supported fewer restrictions on abortion,  and 63 percent were against a presidential veto on the bill.      Church leaders in Uruguay warned that Catholic lawmakers  voting for the bill could face excommunication, a statement  that sparked criticism from across the political spectrum.      In the region, Cuba has the most permissive abortion laws,  and Mexico City allows abortions on demand in the first  trimester of pregnancy.      A congressional committee in Brazil defeated a measure to  legalize the procedure earlier this year.

      "Text": "    By Will Dunham      WASHINGTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Babies born four to six  weeks prematurely have more than triple the risk of developing  cerebral palsy than full-term babies, U.S. researchers said on  Thursday.      The study focused on the specific serious neurological  problems associated with late pre-term births -- babies born  between 34 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Increasing numbers of  these babies are being born in the United States.      Researchers led by Joann Petrini, an epidemiologist with  the March of Dimes advocacy group, tracked 141,321 babies born  between 2000 and 2004 in the United States.      The late pre-term babies were about 3.4 times as likely to  develop cerebral palsy as full-term babies. They also were  about 25 percent more likely to develop learning, speech and  other developmental delays and mental retardation as full-term  babies, according to the study.      Cerebral palsy refers to a group of disorders that affect a  child's ability to coordinate body movements. Symptoms range  from mild to severe and may include lack of muscle  coordination, stiff muscles and exaggerated reflexes, walking  problems, drooling and tremors.      It is incurable and frequently requires long-term care.  Other neurological problems including mental retardation or  seizures may appear in children who have cerebral palsy.      About 800,000 children and adults in the United States have  cerebral palsy, according to the March of Dimes.      'We know that very pre-term babies have higher rates of  cerebral palsy from existing research, but this paper shows  that even the late pre-term babies are three times as likely to  be diagnosed with cerebral palsy as full-term babies,' Petrini  said in a telephone interview.      In this study, very pre-term babies -- those born after 30  to 33 weeks of pregnancy -- were eight times as likely to  develop cerebral palsy as full-term babies.      The researchers said previous studies showed that late  pre-term babies also had higher rates of respiratory distress,  jaundice, seizures, feeding problems and other problems.      In the United States, growing numbers of babies are being  born prematurely. About 70 percent of all pre-term births fall  into this late pre-term birth category.      Petrini cited several factors behind the rise in late  pre-term births. These include more older women and women with  obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure having babies, more  babies being delivered by Caesarean section, and more being  conceived after fertility treatments.

      "Text": "     WASHINGTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - No high-quality study done  to date can document that having an abortion causes  psychological distress, or a 'post-abortion syndrome,' and  efforts to show it does occur appear to be politically  motivated, U.S. researchers said on Thursday.      A team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore reviewed 21  studies involving more than 150,000 women and found the  high-quality studies showed no significant differences in  long-term mental health between women who choose to abort a  pregnancy and others.      'The best research does not support the existence of a  'post-abortion syndrome' similar to post-traumatic stress  disorder,' Dr. Robert Blum, who led the study published in the  journal Contraception, said in a statement.      'Based on the best available evidence, emotional harm  should not be a factor in abortion policy. If the goal is to  help women, program and policy decisions should not distort  science to advance political agendas,' added Vignetta Charles,  a researcher and doctoral student at Johns Hopkins who worked  on the study.       An estimated 1.29 million American women get elective  abortions each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention. An estimated 25 million women globally  have legal abortions every year.      Abortion is a hot-button political issue, with many voters  and members of the U.S. Congress as well as state lawmakers  seeking to ban it.      'The U.S. Supreme Court, while noting that 'we find no  reliable data to measure the phenomenon,' cited adverse mental  health outcomes for women as part of the rationale for limiting  late term abortions,' Blum's team wrote.      The researchers reviewed all English-language,  peer-reviewed publications between 1989 and 2008 that studied  relationships between abortion and long-term mental health.      They analyzed those that included valid mental health  measures and factored in pre-existing mental health status and   potentially confusing factors.      'The best quality studies indicate no significant         differences in long-term mental health between women in the  United States who choose to terminate a pregnancy and those who  do not,' they wrote.      '...studies with the most flawed methodology consistently  found negative mental health consequences of abortion,' they  added. 'Scientists are still conducting research to answer  politically motivated questions.'

      "Text": "    By Ben Harding      MADRID, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Spanish abortion clinics began a  week-long strike on Tuesday, criticising the government for what  they said was harassment since a series of police raids on  Barcelona centres accused of illegal abortions.      More than 1,000 women will be unable to have an abortion  this week after 31 private clinics shut their doors to all cases  except for those when the mother's health was at risk, said a  spokeswoman for abortion clinic association ACAI. The 31 clinics  performed most of Spain's 101,592 abortions in 2006, ACAI said.      Late last year Barcelona police arrested 13 people, many of  them gynaecologists and anaesthetists, in raids against clinics  accused of performing illegal, late-term abortions.      ACAI spokeswoman Francisca Garcia said the government had  increased intrusive inspections against its members even though  none of its members were involved in the raids. Spain's health  minister had ignored requests for talks, she said.      Spain's health ministry was not immediately available to  comment on the accusation.      'We think the number and manner of inspections is abusive,'  Garcia said, adding that so many inspections, three times the  norm in some clinics, violated the privacy of patients and was a  slur on the professionalism of staff.      Spain decriminalised abortion in 1985, 10 years after the  death of conservative dictator Francisco Franco, but while the  number of abortions has doubled in the last decade, the practice  is controversial in the traditionally Catholic country.      Abortion is only permitted in certain cases, for example up  to 12 weeks for women who have been raped or up to 22 weeks if a  foetus is malformed. It is also available if a birth poses a  psychological risk to the mother.      One of those detained in the raids was Peruvian doctor  Carlos Morin, who was shown in a television programme appearing  to offer an abortion to an undercover Danish journalist who was  eight months pregnant in return for 4,000 euros.      The police findings triggered indignation in conservative  media.      But some members of the governing Socialist Party said  abortion laws should be further liberalised. Prime Minister Jose  Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, facing a tight contest in March general  elections, rejected this.      Last month the windows of a clinic in Madrid were smashed by  masked attackers and staff across Spain have reported a rise in  threats against them, Garcia said.      'After 22 years of exercising this right a shadow of doubt  has started to appear over our professionalism,' she said.

Tiller is executing fetuses in his Wichita clinic for $5,000. And records show he'll do it for vague medical reasons. That is, he'll kill the fetus, viable outside the womb, if the mother wants it dead. No danger to the mother's life, no catastrophic damage if the woman delivers.\n\nNow, some Kansas politicians want to stop the madness. But incredibly, Governor Kathleen Sebelius is protecting Tiller, citing privacy. The governor vetoed a bill a few weeks ago that would have forced Tiller to provide a specific medical reason for destroying a viable fetus.\n\nNow America is a great country, but this kind of barbaric display in Kansas diminishes our entire nation. Tiller has killed thousands, thousands of late-term fetuses without explanation. And Governor Sebelius is allowing him to continue the slaughter. How the governor sleeps at night is beyond me.\n\nThere are Americans who believe that babies that are about to be born are not human beings. How they form that conclusion is interesting. And only a handful of doctors in the USA will perform late-term abortions for any reason, because doctors know viable life when they see it. Now a few months ago, we talked with a young woman who allowed Tiller to kill her fetus. Here's part of what she had to say.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKELLY: And about the third or fourth day, Dr. Tiller came in and injected into the amniotic sack saline solution, which suffocated and burned my baby to death. They decide that you are dilated enough and they put you in a wheelchair and wheel you out to another room.\n\nAnd in this other room, there is basically a toilet. And they told me to sit on the toilet, lean on the nurse, and push. Push my baby into a toilet. And after that, they wheel you into another room to remove all the, you know, after birth. And really that's the only two times I ever saw the doctor was when he injected the saline solution and when he finished the process by removing the after birth.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAnd the woman was just 14-years old when Tiller operated on her. She is haunted by her decision to this day.\n\nIt's ironic that organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International say nothing about the work of Dr. Tiller. Apparently executing viable fetuses in the womb is OK with the human rights people.\n\nOnce again, this isn't about a woman's right to choose or The New York Times\u2019 plea for reproductive rights. This is about late term abortions for just about any reason. No question Dr. Tiller has blood on his hands, but now so does Governor Sebelius. She is not fit to serve. Nor is any Kansas politician who supports Tiller's business of destruction. I wouldn't want to be these people if there is a judgment day.\n\nAnd that's the \"Memo.\"\n\nMost Ridiculous Item\n\nTime now for \"The Most Ridiculous Item of the Day.\" Our good friend, Howard Dean, was in New York City recently. But he didn't drop in here. Instead, he went to see that Colbert guy.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, COMEDY CENTRAL'S \"THE COLBERT REPORT\": If you had to vote for one of the Republican candidates, who would you vote for? You can talk about them, right? You can talk about them.\n\nHOWARD DEAN, DNC CHAIRMAN: I thought about this ahead of time.\n\nCOLBERT: Who would it be?\n\nDEAN: If you were to pick Bill O'Reilly to be a running mate, I'd vote for Steve Colbert and Bill O'Reilly.\n\nCOLBERT: Really? That's great. I know Papa Bear watches, but I'm not sure whether he would take the vice presidential position. It's not his M.O.\n\nDEAN: And then you can do all the torturing you want. What does Bill O'Reilly do every night?\n\nCOLBERT: He might start with you.\n\nDEAN: He would start with me if I'd go on his show, but I come on this show instead, because it's much classier.\n\nCOLBERT: How come \u2014 thank you very much, sir. His words \u2014 his words, not mine, Bill.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHe's a fun guy. And Governor Dean is welcome to come on here any time. We won't torture him; we will just ask him questions.\n\nWe'll continue 24/7 on BillOReilly.com where you can get Dad this pen, \"Keep it Pithy.\" It's beautiful. You'll like it. \"No Bloviating\" T's, golf balls, signed \"Culture Warriors.\" Get Dad the best gifts for Father's Day on BillOReilly.com.\n\n\u2014You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Most Ridiculous Item\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

      "Text": "    CAPE TOWN, Feb 7 (Reuters) - South Africa's parliament on  Thursday approved legal changes to make abortions easier to  obtain, despite criticism from opponents who said the law was  already too lax.      The changes will provide for 24-hour abortion facilities, do  away with pre-approval procedures and permit all nurses --  instead of just midwives -- to terminate pregnancies.      'The amendment bill promotes quality health care,' Joyce  Masilo, a deputy from the ruling African National Congress, told  parliament's upper house, which unanimously passed the bill. It  will now be referred to President Thabo Mbeki to sign into law.      Critics said the law already made abortions too easy. Women  as young as 12 can get an abortion during the first 12 weeks of  pregnancy and in some cases up to 20 weeks.      Religious activists and several political parties opposed  the proposed changes, saying the bill should make counselling  mandatory given that women as young as 12 could have abortions  without their parents' knowledge.      But the ruling party's big parliamentary majority ensured  approval for the changes.

Banks received 151.5 billion euros ($222.7 billion) in  weekly funding from the ECB on Wednesday, less than half the  amount put into circulation to cover the New Year period,  tightening liquidity conditions.

      "Text": "    BRASILIA, July 9 (Reuters) - A committee in Brazil's lower  house of Congress voted down a bill on Wednesday that would  have legalized abortion in the world's most populous Roman  Catholic nation.      The Justice and Constitution Committee in the Chamber of  Deputies voted 57-4 against a bill that had been stuck in  Congress for 17 years, steeped in controversy. It is now   likely to be shelved.      'This bill won't prosper in the Chamber,' said Deputy  Eduardo Cunha, committee leader.      Several ruling party legislators pushed the bill after  Health Minister Jose Temporao last year all but endorsed  legalizing abortion.      Church groups, which lobbied against the legislative  proposal and witnessed the hearing, cheered and prayed in  celebration after the vote.      Some deputies had placards hanging from their necks,  showing pictures of aborted fetuses.      A few legislators supported the bill.      'You can't treat this issue on the basis of religion or  belief. It's a public health issue,' said Deputy Jose Genoino,  who voted in favor of the proposal.           Temporao angered church groups by proposing a referendum on  the legalization of abortion and backing increased use of  contraceptives.      The government has begun distributing condoms in public  high schools and in April launched its own factory to produce  condoms made of rubber from Amazon trees.      Temporao has warned that the large number of women having  illegal abortions was a serious public health issue because of  often dangerous complications when they went awry.      Annually more than 200,000 women are hospitalized because  of botched abortions, government statistics show. Based on  those figures some experts estimate the number of abortions  could be as high as around 1 million per year.      Many Brazilians believe it is mostly poor teenagers who  abort. But a study co-sponsored by the University of Brasilia  showed that most abortions were practiced by Catholic mothers,  aged 20-29, with jobs, who used contraceptive devices and had  steady sexual partners.

      "Text": "    By Lee Jiyeon      SEOUL, April 4 (Reuters Life!) - At a clinic in a fashionable  area of Seoul, young women sit in plush leather couches waiting  for a doctor to give them an illegal abortion.      By the hundreds of thousands each year South Korean women  have gone to clinics like this, which operate in the open.      Abortions have been illegal for almost as long as South Korea  has existed but, in an uneasy compromise, law enforcement  officials have been willing to look the other way as long as  qualified doctors perform the operation.      Many public health experts in South Korea are pushing for  changes in the abortion law but face opposition from a strong  pro-life lobby in a country with one of Asia's largest  percentages of Christians and a government trying to boost the  lowest fertility rate in the developed world.      Some doctors are themselves reluctant to lose a lucrative  income in cash or credit and mostly away from the eyes of tax  officials.      'Abortions do bring in money,' said physician Park Sung-chul,  who was forced to shut down his private clinic because of a  substantial loss of income when he stopped doing the procedure.      The law allows for abortion only in cases where the mother's  health is at risk, the baby is to be born with severe birth  defects or the pregnancy was caused by a sexual crime.      'Most abortions are for pregnancies out of wedlock and not  for health reasons,' Park said.      According to the most recent figures, an estimated 350,000  abortions were performed in 2005. That is equivalent to about 80  percent of the total number of babies born that year.            CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT      Doctors can face up to two years in prison or lose their  licenses for illegal abortions, though only very few cases have  ever gone to court.      It is also illegal for doctors to tell expecting parents the  sex of their child because many families place a higher value on  having boys than girls.      South Korea criminalised abortion in 1953 when its  authoritarian leaders wanted to boost the population and build an  army powerful enough to fend off its rival North Korea.      But by the 1970s, population growth was getting out of  control, leading the country to draw up exceptions to the  abortion law.      Yonsei University medical law and ethics professor Kim  So-yoon, who headed a government-commissioned research team on  how to reform abortion laws feels a sweeping change is needed.      'We should not let these laws, which were set up under  different ideals, stay as they are,' said Kim.      Kim, with the backing of several women's rights groups, is  lobbying to widen the conditions under which abortion is  permitted, seen as more expedient than striking down the old law  and drawing up a new one.      Many South Korean Christians, who make up roughly a third of  the population, are fighting the change.      'The government, under its family planning policy, has  planted in people's minds for the past 35 years the idea that  there is nothing wrong with abortion,' Pastor Kim Hyeon-chul, one  of the leaders in the pro-life movement, said.      South Korean society does not generally look favourably on  young, single mothers, forcing many to seek abortions or give  birth in secret and put their child up for adoption.      In the meantime, a proliferation of postings seeking abortion  advice on the Internet suggests demand is as strong as ever.      'I'm a high-school student and would l",

      "Text": "    YAOUNDE, April 4 (Reuters) - Cameroon's government has  presented a constitutional reform to parliament to remove term  limits for President Paul Biya, who has ruled the central  African country for over 25 years, state radio said on Friday.      Popular discontent over the plans to extend Biya's rule when  his current seven-year term expires in 2011 was one of the  causes of rioting in Cameroon this year which left some 100  people dead, according to civil rights campaigners.      Biya had confirmed his intention to stand again in an  end-of-year speech, citing popular calls for him to stay in  power and saying the term limit was undemocratic.      He revised the constitution in 1996 -- after 14 years in  office -- to extend the presidential term from five to seven  years and make it renewable only once.       He won the first seven-year term in 1997 and was re-elected  in 2004, and is currently barred from running again in 2011.      Biya's rule has been marred by human rights abuses and  Cameroon's reputation as one of the most corrupt countries in  the world, particularly in the late 1990s. In recent years, some  ministers and senior officials have been jailed for graft.      Cameroon's parliament is overwhelmingly controlled by the  ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement.       Legislators in Nigeria, Zambia and Malawi have blocked  efforts to allow third terms for presidents in recent years.

      "Text": "    By Ed Stoddard      DALLAS, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Can Joe Biden bring his Catholic  brethren into Barack Obama's fold?      Biden, the Democratic vice presidential candidate and an  Irish Catholic from a Pennsylvania working-class background,  could also win over blue-collar workers who backed Obama's  party rival for the White House, Hillary Clinton.      'If we just focus on the religious element, adding Biden to  the Democratic ticket was an extremely smart move,' said  Michael Lindsay of Rice University in Houston. Obama made Biden  his running mate on Saturday.      'Biden has ties in a very important swing state,  Pennsylvania, where Catholics are the biggest constituency  whose votes are up for grabs,' Lindsay told Reuters.      U.S. presidential elections are often decided by swing  states that move from party to party. Catholics have been a  swing vote also for decades. Opinion polls show white Catholics  evenly split between Obama and Republican John McCain.      John Kennedy became America's only Catholic president in  1961. If elected, Biden would be the first Catholic vice  president. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is next in line to  the president after the vice president, is also a Catholic.      Faith features in U.S. elections despite a formal  separation of church and state in the workings of government.  Candidates are often asked about the role of faith in their  lives and how it might shape their presidencies.      Biden's broad support for abortion rights could help with  more liberal Catholics while his opposition to late-term  abortions could attract those who are uncomfortable with the  procedure but don't vote on it.           ABORTION ISSUE      Opinion polls show that abortion, a traditionally divisive  issue for Americans, is less of a factor for most people in  this election than the economy, the Iraq war and health care,  which top their priorities.      A Catholic candidate who speaks with passion about his  religion, such as Biden, might also attract blue collar  Hispanic voters, a majority of whom are Catholic.      Abortion may be more of a political minefield -- Catholic  doctrine is strongly opposed to it -- but Catholics who oppose  abortion rights and vote as such already are squarely in the  Republican camp.      'There is a broader group of Catholics who have pro-life  sympathies but who don't vote exclusively on that issue and in  that case Biden may be an appealing candidate,' said Allen  Hertzke, a professor of political science at the University of  Oklahoma in Norman.     'And the fact that he has opposed late-term abortions gives  him some talking points which Obama doesn't have,' he said.      Opinion polls have shown a close battle for the Catholic  vote at the national level with a slight edge for Obama.  Catholics account for nearly a quarter of U.S. adults.      The electoral clout of the Catholic vote is somewhat  diluted by its distribution.      According to a report by the Center for Applied Research in  the Apostolate at Georgetown University in Washington, nearly  four in 10 U.S. Catholics live in New York, California and  Texas, none of which are closely contested.      The report said states 'where the Catholic vote could make  a real difference are Florida, Ohio and Louisiana.'

ADNOC had sealed its April 2009-March 2010 pentane and  splitter naphtha grades at $23.50-$26.00 a tonne premiums to  Middle East quotes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis, at least five  times higher that what it fetched for its January-December 2009  supplies, concluded late last year.

      "Text": "    By Oleg Shchedrov      MOSCOW, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Uzbekistan's leader Islam Karimov,  who exploited a legal loophole to stay in office for a third  term, said on Wednesday that his Russian counterpart Vladimir  Putin could have used a similar tactic.      But Karimov quickly acknowledged that his advice had come a  bit too late.      Karimov, on a visit to Russia to discuss cooperation between  the two former Soviet republics, said Putin should have ordered  a referendum to extend the president's term in office.      'It is too late to talk about this now,' he said. 'But if  such an option worked, I am convinced that no one would regret  it. Such decision would be the most logical and correct,'  Karimov told reporters.      Putin, who was standing alongside Karimov when he made the  comments, did not react.      Russia is due to hold presidential elections in March. Putin  says he will step down next May in line with a constitutional  ban on a head of state serving more than two consecutive terms.  But Putin has said he plans to retain influence in the country.      Opinion polls suggest his close ally Dmitry Medvedev is  likely to be elected as the next president.      Karimov, accused by rights activists and Western governments  of tolerating no dissent in his Central Asia republic, won a  third term in an election last year that Western monitors said  was undemocratic.      Uzbekistan's constitution, like Russia's, bars a president  from serving three consecutive terms.      Karimov avoided the ban because in 2002 the country held a  referendum to extend presidential terms from 5 to 7 years. Legal  experts said that meant his time in office would be counted from  2002, not the point he first came to power.

      "Text": " (Repeats story published late on Monday)      PRAGUE, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Czech short-term interbank lending  rose while longer-term transactions nearly dried up as the   global financial crisis affected the Czech market, a  semi-annual central bank survey showed on Monday.      Foreign exchange activity weakened with overall daily  turnover declining slightly but spot transactions grew by more  than a third, a separate survey unveiled.      The global market turbulence has so far had relatively  limited impact on the central European country, with no banks  failing and no currency slump.      But markets have been hit and banks have grown reluctant to  lend to each other for longer maturities. Interbank money market  rates have jumped.      'The most significant among deposit operations were deposit  operations with a maturity up to one week (99 percent), in  particular overnight operations comprising 91 percent share of  the total turnover,' the bank said.      'This was caused mainly by tightening of banks' credit  policy,' it said.      The survey conducted in the week between Oct. 6 and Oct. 10  showed the daily average turnover of deposit operations rose to  86.6 billion crowns ($4.58 billion) from 77.2 billion in April.      Derivative transactions in interest rate swaps (IRS) and  forward rate agreements (FRA) dropped by 77 percent and 90  percent respectively due to widening spreads caused by high  volatility and risk aversion, the survey showed.        A separate central bank survey, conducted between Oct. 13  and Oct. 17, showed the daily average foreign exchange market  turnover dipped 1.8 percent from April to $8.86 billion. Spot  transactions grew 35.2 percent while forwards and swaps fell  14.1 percent.

That is the subject of this evening's \"Talking Points Memo.\"\n\nCampaigning Monday for her husband in Wisconsin, Mrs. Obama said something that has caused major controversy, and she said it twice.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA, BARACK OBAMA'S WIFE: Let me tell you something. For the first time in my adult life, I am proud of my country, because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd let me tell you something. I need to believe that we live in that kind of nation, where hope and possibility and unity is still what drives us.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nNow, the problem with that statement is the words \"for the first time in my adult life I am proud of my country.\" Perhaps Michelle Obama simply misspoke. That happens all the time when you give speeches. But Mrs. Obama said it twice in two different speeches.\n\nNow I'm willing, I'm willing to give Mrs. Obama the benefit of the doubt if she wants that benefit. The problem is she's been silent, letting others speak for her.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDAVID AXELROD, BARACK OBAMA'S CHIEF STRATEGIST: She gives this talk all the time, and I don't think she formulates the words quite that way generally. But if you look at the whole quote and read beyond it, she was plainly talking about this burst of participation, this sense of hope, the sense of possibility and so on. And she was talking about the politics of our country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOK, fine. But again, Michelle Obama should be explaining herself, not paid advisers.\n\nWhy is an explanation needed, you might ask? Well, because most Americans are proud of their country and don't like it see it run down in any way. Michelle Obama is a prominent person. What she says carries weight all over the world. Also, what she says can be used against her.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCINDY MCCAIN, JOHN MCCAIN'S WIFE: I'm proud of my country. I don't know about you, if you heard those words earlier. I'm very proud of my country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWell, the fact that Michelle Obama has not clarified the situation is a major mistake for the Obama campaign.\n\nAgain, I don't believe Michelle Obama dislikes her country. I sincerely hope she does not, but this is a big deal. It is not going away.

      "Text": "Barack Obama\u2019s wife, Michelle, is under fire for leaving the impression that she hasn\u2019t been proud of her country until now, when Democrats are beginning to rally around her husband\u2019s campaign.\n\nSpeaking in Milwaukee, Wis., on Monday, she said, \u201cPeople in this country are ready for change and hungry for a different kind of politics and \u2026 for the first time in my adult life I am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback.\u201d\n\nGreeted with rousing applause after making the comment in Milwaukee, Obama delivered an amended version of the speech later that day in Madison, Wis.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in my adult lifetime, I\u2019m really proud of my country \u2026 not just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry for change,\u201d she said. \u201cI have been desperate to see our country moving in that direction and just not feeling so alone in my frustration and disappointment.\u201d\n\nObama was born in 1964, meaning her adult life began in 1982. Critics quickly seized on the newfound national pride.\n\n\u201cI am proud of my country,\u201d John McCain\u2019s wife, Cindy, said at a campaign stop in Brookfield, Wis., Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you heard those words earlier \u2026 but I am very proud of my country.\u201d\n\nDuring a follow up press conference, the Arizona senator was asked if they were responding to Michelle Obama and he deferred to his wife.\n\nMcCain responded: \u201cI just wanted to make the statement that I have and always will be proud of my country.\u201d\n\nObama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the candidate\u2019s wife wasn\u2019t trying to knock her country, only underscore the meaning behind her husband\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cThe point is that of course Michelle is proud of her country, which is why she and Barack talk constantly about how their story wouldn\u2019t be possible in any other nation on Earth,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat she meant is that she\u2019s really proud at this moment because for the first time in a long time, thousands of Americans who\u2019ve never participated in politics before are coming out in record numbers to build a grassroots movement for change.\u201d\n\nBut conservative outlets aren\u2019t so ready to let her off the hook.\n\n\u201cCan it really be there has not been a moment during that time when she felt proud of her country?\u201d reads an article in Commentary magazine. \u201cForget matters like the victory in the Cold War; how about only things that have made liberals proud \u2014 all the accomplishments of inclusion? How about the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991? Or Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s elevation to the Supreme Court?\u201d\n\nThe article then says Michelle Obama\u2019s comments suggest \u201cthe pseudo-messianic nature of the Obama candidacy is very much a part of the way the Obamas themselves are feeling.\u201d\n\nWeekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol said the comment \u201cwas sort of revealing.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was an adult when we won the Cold War without firing a shot. She was an adult for the last 25 years of economic progress, social progress,\u201d he told FOX News. \u201cI think the Democrats have to be careful \u2026 they\u2019re running against the status quo \u2026 You have to be careful not to let that slide into a kind of indictment of America. Because I don\u2019t think the American people think on the whole that the last 25 years of American history is a narrative of despair and nothing to be proud of.\u201d\n\nDemocratic strategist Bob Beckel said Obama \u201cshouldn\u2019t have said it the way she said it\u201d but she gets the benefit of his doubt. He added that she most likely was just referring to the grassroots movement that\u2019s swelled to support her husband, but she needs to be more careful.\n\n\u201cThe Obama\u2019s have to recognize they are now front-runners, and everything they say, it\u2019s now open hunting season for people,\u201d he said.\n\nClick here to see the video of Michelle Obama talking in Madison about being proud of her country for the first time.\n\nClick here to read the posting on the Commentary Web site.\n\nFOX News\u2019 Mosheh Oinounou and Bonney Kapp contributed to this report.",

      "Text": "    NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama wrote a  thank-you note to Laura Bush after the first lady spoke up in  defense of the wife of the Democratic presidential candidate,  Obama said on Wednesday.      Obama, who is married to Illinois Sen. Barack Obama,  created a controversy on the campaign trail in February when  she said, 'For the first time in my adult lifetime I am really  proud of my country.'      After critics questioned her patriotism because of the  remark, Obama has frequently said she is proud of her country.      During an appearance on ABC Television's 'The View' on  Wednesday, she re-stated her pride in the United States and  said her controversial comment was referring to being proud of  the political process this year.      Laura Bush came to Obama's defense earlier this month,  telling ABC's 'Good Morning America': 'I think she probably  meant, 'I'm more proud.' You have to be very careful in what  you say. Everything you say is looked at and in many cases  misconstrued.'      Obama said she appreciated Bush's comments and concern.      'I was touched by it and actually I sent her a note,' Obama  said on 'The View.' 'It took me a while to write it. Like, how  do I address her? I sent it to 'Madam First Lady.' I don't want  to talk about it because she might not have it yet.      'That's what I like about Laura Bush, her whole rational  approach to these issues. I am taking some cues. There's a  reason why people like her, because she doesn't sort of fuel  the fire.'

      "Text": "    By Matthew Bigg      ATLANTA, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama brings the skills  of a corporate lawyer to the White House as first lady to  President-elect Barack Obama, but she says her priority will be  her role as 'mom-in-chief' to the couple's two daughters.      Democrat Obama beat Republican John McCain in Tuesday's  election. He will be the first black U.S. president and his  wife the first black first lady.      Michelle Obama, 44, was a passionate advocate for her  husband's candidacy, but she says she would not want a direct  policy role in an Obama administration.      'My first job, in all honesty, is going to continue to be  'mom-in-chief,'' she said in a recent magazine interview  referring to daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7.      She also says she hopes to focus ways women maintain a  work-family balance and the needs of military families, and she  could act as an informal adviser to her husband as she has been  during the campaign.      Obama, who grew up in a blue-collar neighborhood on the  south side of Chicago and went to public school, often talks  about her father -- who worked for the city's public water  system -- and the values instilled by her parents.      After winning scholarships to the elite universities of  Princeton and Harvard law school, Obama worked for a law firm  and in the Chicago mayor's office.      Her most recent job was vice president of the University of  Chicago hospitals, where she earned more than her husband. Even  though the Obamas are now well off, partly due to royalties  from Barack Obama's two books, Michelle Obama stresses the  values she learned growing up.      'When you are raised in a home ... (in which) you have love  and security and you have people who are sacrificing for you  ... you have an obligation to give back,' she said. 'That's why  community service has been such a big part of my life.'           'PROUD OF MY COUNTRY'      In his victory speech Tuesday night, Barack Obama described  his wife as 'my best friend for the last 16 years, the rock of  our family, the love of my life.' He says she has been a source  of strength and a gentle critic who keeps him grounded.      Their public displays of affection and her fashion sense --  she has been featured in magazines such as Vogue  and Essence  -- contribute to the candidate's youthful image.      In a widely praised speech at the Democratic National  Convention, Michelle Obama shared details of the couple's life  together and said her husband represented typical American  values.      'What struck me when I first met Barack was that even  though he had this funny name, and even though he'd grown up  all the way across the continent in Hawaii, his family was so  much like mine,' she said.      'He was raised by grandparents who were working-class folks  like my parents, and by a single mother who struggled to pay  the bills just like we did.'      Michelle Obama has receded from the limelight since the  convention, even though she draws large crowds while  campaigning solo for her husband.      She is immensely popular with Democrats who warm to the  strength and smartness she projects, but in February she  stirred controversy with comments she made on the campaign  trail.      'For the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud  of my country,' she told an audience in Wisconsin. 'And not  just because Barack has done well, but because I think people  are hungry for change.'      Conservatives criticized h",

      "Text": "    WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - Democratic presidential  hopeful Barack Obama said on Monday that Republican critics  should stop picking on his wife Michelle.      'These folks should lay off my wife,' Obama said in an  interview with ABC's 'Good Morning America.'      Obama was referring to a four-minute video posted on  YouTube by the Tennessee Republican Party last week during a  visit by Michelle Obama that portrayed a remark she made in  February in an unflattering manner.      Michelle Obama's remark that 'for first time in my adult  lifetime I'm proud of my country' stirred a controversy at the  time. Critics said it sounded unpatriotic and suggested she had  not been proud of her country before her husband's candidacy.      In the ABC interview, Obama, an Illinois senator and  Democratic front-runner to contest the November election  against Republican John McCain, called the video 'low class'  and said 'most of the American people would think that as  well.'      The Republican video repeatedly showed Michelle Obama  making the proud remark interspersed with comments by  Tennesseans about their own patriotism.      'Whoever is in charge of the Tennessee GOP needs to think  long and hard about the kind of campaign that they want to  run,' Obama said.      Michelle Obama joined her husband in the ABC interview and  said she believed voters were more focused on the issues.      'We are trusting that the American voters are ready to talk  about the issues and not talking about things that have nothing  to do with making people's lives better,' she said.      Obama has not formally won the Democratic presidential  nomination, but he leads against New York Sen. Hillary Clinton  in the pledged delegates to the August party convention that  will pick a candidate to run against McCain, an Arizona  senator. The Democratic candidates face off in primaries in  Oregon and Kentucky on Tuesday, and three more before the party  voting ends on June 3.

      "Text": "    Aug 25 Reuters) - Michelle Obama, wife of Democratic  presidential candidate Barack Obama, will be the featured  speaker at the opening night of the party's nominating  convention on Monday.      Here are some facts about the woman who would be the first  African-American first lady if her husband is elected on Nov.  4:           * Obama, 44, met her husband through her work as a  corporate lawyer and is his closest adviser, although  associates have described her role as less of a policy-oriented  one than that of a confidante who provides a reality check.      * Educated at Princeton and Harvard, Obama was initially  reticent about getting involved in the election campaign, but  now draws large crowds of her own.      * Obama has taken time off from her job as a vice president  of community relations at the University of Chicago Hospitals  to campaign for her husband.      * Her first priority if she becomes first lady would be her  two young daughters, but she would also hope to focus on how  women can maintain a work-family balance.      * Critics seized on her comment that 'For the first time in  my adult life, I am proud of my country' as evidence of a lack  of patriotism, a charge her husband also has faced.      * Known for a sense of style, Obama has appeared in Vogue  and been compared to former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy. She  was widely praised by fashion writers for the violet sheath  dress she wore to her husband's Democratic nomination victory  rally.      * Asked in a CBS interview last week what his wife would  wear for her prime-time television appearance on Monday, Obama  replied: 'You know, there -- there are some things that even I  don't know. And what Michelle is going to wear is a tightly  held secret.'

Obama says she never expected to be on stage extolling her  husband's virtues, but she is revving up crowds as she tells  them he is the Democratic candidate who offers the best option  for change in the United States.      'I am very passionate about change in the country and  that's what you see,' the 44-year-old Princeton- and  Harvard-educated lawyer from Chicago told Reuters in an  interview last year.

Though she joins her husband, 46, for major rallies, where  she is a popular warm-up act, Michelle Obama has her own  schedule of events -- usually in more intimate settings where  she can meet people and answer questions one-on-one.

She went on to Harvard Law School, then worked in a  corporate law firm in Chicago.      It was there she met Barack in 1988. Although he is three  years older, her husband spent several years working as a  community organizer before going to law school. As a new  lawyer, Michelle was assigned as his adviser.      They began dating soon after and were married in 1992.      Obama regularly says he is lucky his wife never decided to  run for office. In his book 'The Audacity of Hope,' he wrote,  'If I ever had to run against her for public office, she would  beat me without much difficulty.'

      "Text": "    By Jill Serjeant      LOS ANGELES, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Oprah Winfrey wept tears of  joy, Leonardo DiCaprio said he was proud to be an American and  several hip-hop music stars said Sen. Barack Obama's election  as the first black U.S. president fulfilled the dreams of  America's youth.      Celebrities played a large, and sometimes controversial,  role in Obama's election campaign, organizing fund-raisers,  performing at rallies and campaigning on his behalf.      Republican candidate John McCain used Obama's popularity  with actors and musicians during the campaign to mock the  Illinois senator as little more than a celebrity himself.      But when Obama was declared president-elect on Tuesday, his  A-list supporters spoke out again.      DiCaprio, in Rome for the Italian premiere of his movie  'Body of Lies', told reporters on Wednesday he had stayed up  all night watching the election.      'I couldn't be more proud of my country right now and proud  of being an American ... I feel overwhelmed and I feel a  tremendous weight has been lifted from my shoulders,' the  'Titanic' star said.      Talk-show host Winfrey, one of America's most influential   women, campaigned with Obama last year. On Tuesday night,  millions of TV viewers saw her in tears among the tens of  thousands gathered in Chicago for Obama's victory speech.      'It feels like America did the right thing,' Winfrey told  CNN. 'It feels like there's a shift in consciousness. It feels  like something really big and bold has happened here, like  nothing ever in our lifetimes did we expect this to happen.'      Hip-hop music and fashion mogul Russell Simmons said  Obama's election was 'a clear reflection of hip-hop politics.'      'While many older Americans, who marched and struggled so  hard so Senator Obama could run for president of the United  States never dared to believe in his candidacy's real  potential, young people, particularly the hip-hop community,  had faith and their imagination became our reality,' Simmons  said in a statement.           PEOPLE MAGAZINE      R&B singer Usher told Access Hollywood, 'Barack Obama  doesn't represent a color. He represents change.' Black music  producer and singer Sean Diddy Combs said, 'I felt like my vote  was the vote that put him into office ... And that may not be  true but that's how much power it felt like I had.'      People magazine, typically a place to read about Hollywood  stars such as Katie Holmes and Britney Spears, put Obama on its  front cover in a special edition marking his election.      Actor George Clooney said in a statement it was 'time to  begin unifying the country so we can take on the extraordinary  challenges that this generation faces.'      And poet Maya Angelou, 80, author of the influential book  'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings', said she could barely talk  without weeping as she remembered all the African-Americans who  had struggled for civil rights in the past.      'We are growing up. My God, I'm so grateful,' Angelou told  'The Early Show' on CBS.      'We have elected a black man to talk for us, to speak for  us. We, blacks, whites, Asians, Spanish-speaking, Native  Americans, we have done it.'

Although he is three  years older, her husband spent several years working as a  community organizer before going to law school. As a new  lawyer, Michelle was assigned as his adviser.      They began dating soon after and were married in 1992.      Obama regularly says he is lucky his wife never decided to  run for office. In his book 'The Audacity of Hope,' he wrote,  'If I ever had to run against her for public office, she would  beat me without much difficulty.'

      "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama graces the  cover of next month's Vogue magazine, marking the second time a  U.S. first lady has appeared on the front of one of the world's  leading fashion magazines.      Obama, 45, who has been hailed by both U.S. retailers and  the media as a new fashion icon, donned a magenta sheath dress  for the cover photo. The dress was designed by Jason Wu, who  also created her white inaugural ball gown.      Famed photographer Annie Leibovitz took the cover photo and  several fashion shots featured inside the March edition of  Vogue.      With the exception of Bess Truman, every U.S. first lady  since Lou Hoover in the 1930s has been featured in Vogue, but  Obama is only the second presidential wife to appear on the  cover, Vogue said. Hillary Clinton did so in 1998.      Obama has won praise from fashionistas for mixing designer  pieces with off-the-rack American brands like J. Crew and Gap.       Vogue's editor-at-large, Andre Leon Talley said Obama  selected the outfits worn for the photo shoot herself, from her  own wardrobe, pairing designer wear with affordable clothes.      'She doesn't need any help. She loves fashion and knows  what works for her. She's never had a conversation with me  about, 'What do you think?' or 'How did this look?' And I'm  glad for that.'       Obama told Vogue she loved clothes, but said comfort and  fun was more important than following fashion.      'First and foremost, I wear what I love. That's what women  have to focus on: what makes them happy and what makes them  feel comfortable and beautiful. If I can have any impact, I  want women to feel good about themselves and have fun with  fashion,' she said.      While Obama discussed her views on fashion, she made clear  family was her first priority, particularly caring for  daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7.      'I'm going to try to take them to school every morning, as  much as I can,' Obama told the magazine. 'But there's also a  measure of independence. And obviously there will be times I  won't be able to drop them off at all. I like to be a presence  in my kids' school. I want to know the teachers; I want to know  the other parents,' she said.

Chairman Howard Dean pounded a gavel to start the four-day  convention where Democrats say their presidential candidate  must unite the party, get tough on Republican rival John McCain  and back up soaring oratory with specific policies.       The aim of the first day was to frame Obama's personal  story, the son of a black man from Kenya and white woman from  Kansas who spent his early years in Hawaii and Indonesia,  worked his way through college and began his political career  as a community organizer in Chicago.       His wife, Michelle Obama, headlined the opening night. In  front of a huge crowd waving 'Michelle' signs, she said her  husband represented typical American values, rejecting  Republican charges that Obama is an aloof celebrity.      'What struck me when I first met Barack was that even  though he had this funny name, and even though he'd grown up  all the way across the continent in Hawaii, his family was so  much like mine,' she said.      'He was raised by grandparents who were working class folks  just like my parents, and by a single mother who struggled to  pay the bills just like we did,' she said.       Michelle Obama also put a gloss on her own assertive  personality. She has drawn fire from Republicans for saying she  only recently became proud of her country.      'I come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he  will be an extraordinary president. I come here as a mom whose  girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world,'  she said.      After she spoke, Obama himself appeared for the first time  to the convention, showing up on a large video screen to praise  his wife as she stood on stage with their two young daughters,  Malia and Sasha.      'Malia, Sasha, how did you think Mom did?' said Obama, who  spoke from Kansas City.      'I think she did good,' was the reply.      Speaking to reporters in Illinois, the first-term senator  tried to calm anxiety among some Democrats about a mild slide  in opinion polls that has left him in a dead heat with McCain  heading toward the Nov. 4 election.      He said his nomination acceptance speech on Thursday would  be 'workmanlike,' short on lofty words and long on policy  details.      He also played down divisions with the Clintons, Hillary  and Bill, the former president still stewing over having been  accused by Obama of trying to inject racial politics into the  Democrats' primary battle earlier this year.      'I am absolutely convinced that both Hillary Clinton and  Bill Clinton understand the stakes,' Obama told reporters in  Moline, Illinois.      In her speech, Michelle Obama praised Clinton for seeking  to advance the cause of American women 'so that our daughters  and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher.'      In an emotional high point, Massachusetts Sen. Edward  Kennedy, 76, a symbol of Democratic liberalism who is battling  brain cancer, appeared before the cheering crowd after a  videotaped tribute to his long political life.      'My fellow Americans, it is so wonderful to be here,' said ",

      "Text": "    By Martinne Geller      NEW YORK, Feb 16 (Reuters) - First lady Michelle Obama is  widely hailed as a fashion icon, but industry insiders say  she's quite the opposite, and that's a good thing.      A fashion icon would have an eye-catching signature look  and, while the president's wife has the power to set trends,  her appeal is refreshingly not so defined and deliberate, said  fashion observers at the semi-annual Fashion Week in New York,  where designers are showing their Fall 2009 collections.      Michelle Obama 'is more real than iconic,' said David  Wolfe, creative director of the Doneger Group, which forecasts  trends. 'She doesn't have a locked-in fashion look. She  experiments, which is what fashion is about these days.'      References to Obama, 45, as an icon of fashion are  everywhere. Thin and statuesque, the attorney and mother of two  graces the cover of Vogue magazine's March issue.      She wins lavish attention from designers, editors and  stylists. Stores quickly sell out of the clothes she wears.      While Obama's style merits praise, she is not in the ranks  of such icons as actress Katharine Hepburn, with her tailored  menswear, or Jacqueline Kennedy with her pillbox hats and  wide-frame sunglasses, said Helen Job, a trend forecaster with  WGSN, a fashion research and analysis firm.      'When you think about a fashion icon, it's somebody who has  this ability to influence the public to such a degree ... to  change the direction (a style) is going in,' she said.      Kennedy's sense of style would be out of place among women  today, said Wolfe.      'Jackie Kennedy was locked into the Jackie Kennedy look and  never stepped out of it. That was great, but it certainly isn't  the way modern women dress,' he said.      Obama wears clothes by little-known designers and  mid-priced chains such as J Crew Group Inc <JCG.N>, helping  dispose of the idea that first ladies always must look formal.      'She's really set this new guideline, and I feel like the  White House will never be the same after this somehow,' said  Gloria Baume, fashion director for Teen Vogue.         DEMOCRATIC FASHION     Jason Wu, the young designer of Obama's white inaugural gown  and the magenta dress she wears in Vogue, credits the first  lady with reinvigorating the industry.     'In her own way, she is like a stimulus package for the  fashion industry,' Wu said.      Few first ladies deserved the title as fashion icons, said  Mandi Norwood, a former magazine editor writing a book on  Obama's style.      'We've been trying desperately to promote the first lady  into fashion icon status, but I'm not sure any of them have  truly deserved that title,' she said.      Obama does have some company in U.S. history, said Lisa  Kathleen Graddy, curator of 'The First Ladies at the  Smithsonian' exhibit.      Frances Cleveland's clothes and hairstyle were copied and  commented upon, and advertisers used her to sell products she  had never seen or used. The Victorian-era bustle even fell out  of U.S. fashion when it was reported she would no longer wear  the rear-enhancing gowns.      Another fashionable first lady was Grace Coolidge, who is  considered to have popularized fashion, said Graddy.      Grover Cleveland was president in the late 1800s. Calvin  Coolidge served in the 1920s.

      "Text": "  (Recasts with details of inaugural ball dress, new quotes)      By Jill Serjeant      LOS ANGELES, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama officially  entered the world stage on Tuesday in outfits by U.S. designers  paired with off-the-rack accessories, mixing glamour with  practicality.      The first lady chose a sparkling sheath dress and matching  coat in yellow-gold by Cuban-born designer Isabel Toledo for  the swearing-in ceremony but added olive green gloves from  chain store J.Crew and Jimmy Choo shoes.      For the inaugural balls, she wore a white, one-shouldered  chiffon gown with a full skirt by Taiwan-born U.S. designer  Jason Wu, 26, whose dresses cost up to $6,000.      'How good looking is my wife?,' President Barack Obama  asked the crowd at the first of 10 inaugural balls attended by  the couple.      Michelle Obama's clothing choices were expected to provide  clues to the way she will undertake her role as first lady in a  time of deep recession.      A former lawyer, Michelle Obama, 45, has won kudos for her  chic, youthful style, mixing chain store garments with edgy  designers like Chicago's Mario Pinto and Narciso Rodriguez.      Her daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, both wore J. Crew  coats to the presidential swearing-in ceremony.      Obama won praise in June by wearing a $148 black and white  off-the-rack dress for appearing on the TV chat show 'The  View.' It sold out nationwide overnight.      Her yellow swearing-in outfit was a departure from red,  white or blue tones often adopted by U.S. female politicians  and spouses. Yellow is seen in many parts of the world as a  symbol of hope and optimism.           'RADIATED HOPE AND OPTIMISM'      But Obama's choice did not get universal approval. An  online poll on the Us Weekly celebrity magazine site showed 55  percent of readers hated the outfit and 44 percent loved it.      Bonnie Fuller, former editor in chief of Glamour magazine,  called the outfit bold but wondered on www.huffingtonpost.com:  'Is she walking around in inaugural upholstery?'       New York-based designer Toledo, 47, said the coat and  dress were made of Swiss wool lace, backed with netting for  warmth and lined in French silk.      'For me yellow represents hope,' Toledo told Reuters. 'It  really feels like freshness to me. I wanted to capture  optimism, I wanted it to feel happy, I wanted it to feel  inclusive.'      Her ball gown, which will go on show at the Smithsonian,  received a mixed reaction with U.S. fashion bible Women's Wear  Daily saying it made the Obamas look like newlyweds.      'But Michelle Obama is rewriting the fashion rules and she  looks every inch the style icon she is becoming,' wrote the Los  Angeles Times.      In hard times, fashion commentators expected Obama to avoid  anything too glitzy or frivolous. But dressing down too much  could have attracted as much criticism as extravagance.      Former first lady Rosalynn Carter was criticized during the  1970s oil crisis for wearing her previously worn, off-the-rack  gown to the 1977 inaugural ball.      In 1981, Nancy Reagan was deemed 'too Hollywood' with her  white, one-shoulder, lace satin sheath with crystal beads.      Obama is already considered an ambassador for American  fashion. She was listed in Vanity Fair's magazine's '10 of the  World's Best Dressed People' in both 2007 and 2008 and has  drawn numerous comparisons with Jacqueline Kennedy.

The new U.S. first lady, 45, chose a sparkling sheath dress  and matching coat in a yellow-gold hue by Cuban-born American  designer Isabel Toledo for the presidential swearing-in  ceremony.

      "Text": "    * Obama promises 'workmanlike' acceptance speech      * Michelle Obama disputes elitist charge      * Edward Kennedy speech sets off celebration           By Steve Holland,      DENVER, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Democrats opening their national  convention tried to heal a rift with Hillary Clinton's  resentful supporters on Monday and portrayed Barack Obama as a  down-to-earth American patriot bidding to make history.       Chairman Howard Dean pounded a gavel to start the four-day  convention where Democrats say their presidential candidate  must unite the party, get tough on Republican rival John McCain  and back up soaring oratory with specific policies.      The aim of the first day was to frame Obama's personal  story and the keynote speaker was his wife, Michelle Obama. In  excerpts from her prepared remarks, she seemed to want to  dispel Republican charges that Obama is an aloof celebrity.      'And in the end, after all that's happened these past 19  months, the Barack Obama I know today is the same man I fell in  love with 19 years ago,' she said.      Michelle Obama also put a gloss on her own assertive  personality. She has drawn fire from Republicans for saying she  only recently became proud of her country.      'I come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he  will be an extraordinary president. I come here as a mom whose  girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world,'  she said.      Speaking to reporters in Illinois, the first-term senator  tried to calm anxiety among some Democrats about a mild slide  in opinion polls that has left him in a dead heat with McCain  heading toward the Nov. 4 election.      He said his nomination acceptance speech on Thursday would  be 'workmanlike,' short on lofty words and long on policy  details.      He also played down divisions with the Clintons, Hillary  and Bill, the former president still stewing over having been  accused by Obama of trying to inject racial politics into the  Democrats' primary battle earlier this year.      'I am absolutely convinced that both Hillary Clinton and  Bill Clinton understand the stakes,' Obama told reporters in  Moline, Illinois.      In an emotional high point, Massachusetts Sen. Edward  Kennedy, 76, a symbol of Democratic liberalism who is battling  brain cancer, appeared before the cheering crowd after a  videotaped tribute to his long political life.      'My fellow Americans, it is so wonderful to be here,' said  Kennedy. 'And nothing -- nothing -- is going to keep me away  from this special gathering tonight.'      Casting a cloud over the convention was ongoing resentment  from supporters of New York Sen. Clinton, miffed that she lost  the nomination and upset that she was not picked as Obama's  vice presidential running mate. Obama chose veteran Delaware  Sen. Joe Biden, who arrived at the convention on Monday.      Clinton, speaking to sign-waving supporters from her home  state delegation before the convention began, urged party  unity.      'We are after all Democrats, so it may take a while,' she  said. 'We're not the fall-in-line party. We are diverse. But  make no mistake, we are unified,' she said.           ASSAULT ON MCCAIN BEGINS      Speakers began an assault on McCain, charging him with  wanting to maintain policies of unpopular President George W.  Bush.      'Republicans say that John McCain has experience,' said  House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 'We say that  John McCain has the experience of ",

      "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Feb 25 (Reuters Life!) - Few things are as  sweet to a parent as family meals and bedtime with the kids,  and those are two reasons Michelle Obama says her new life at  the White House is comforting.      Well, those and a little exercise.      In an interview for the March 9 issue of People magazine,  the First Lady reveals some details of her family life in the  month since President Barack Obama was inaugurated, and they  moved their daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7 into 1600  Pennsylvania Ave. in Washington, D.C.      After more than a year living out of suitcases and in hotel  rooms on the campaign trail, Michelle Obama says the family now  has dinner together every night, where they talk about the  highs and lows of their day. Later the president is able to  tuck his children into bed before they drift off to sleep.      'We haven't had that kind of time together for (years), so  that explains a lot why we all feel so good in this space,' the  First Lady told People magazine.      Among their daily routine is exercise for her and her  husband at 5:30 in the morning and breakfast together before  their respective days begin. She said the secrets to their  successful marriage include being able to laugh together and  his ability to stay calm under stress.      But she stopped well short of saying they are a model of  married perfection. 'I don't want anybody to think it's easy.  It works because we really work at it ... We have a strong  marriage, but it's not perfect.'      She did say her husband has quit smoking, for now, and that  Malia and Sasha must still do their chores -- make their beds,  clean their rooms and clear the dishes from the dinner table.      'People (here) want to make your life easy, and when you  have small kids -- I've explained this to the staff -- they  don't need their lives to be easy. They're kids,' she said.      And what about the president's promise to get a dog for the  girls? The First Lady said it is on the way, but is waiting  until April, after the girls have had their spring break from  school. But she has a problem -- the name.      The girls have come up with several ideas, including Frank  and Moose, but mom Obama is not going for those. 'I'm like, no.  Come on. Let's work with the names a little bit,' she said.

      "Text": "    By Caren Bohan      WASHINGTON, June 10 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama and Cindy  McCain share a dislike of rough-edged U.S. politics. Each tried  to talk her spouse out of running for the White House.      Obama, wife of Democratic candidate Barack Obama, and  McCain, who is married to Republican John McCain, are both  known for an elegant sense of style, lending glamour to their  husbands' campaigns.      McCain posed in size zero jeans for the latest issue of  Vogue. Obama, who has also appeared in the fashion magazine,  was praised by style writers for the violet sheath dress she  wore to her husband's Democratic nomination victory rally and  has been compared to former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy.      But the aspiring first ladies have plenty of differences.      Obama, 44, is a Princeton- and Harvard-educated lawyer  raised by blue-collar parents on the working-class South Side  of Chicago. She would be the first African American U.S. first  lady.      Obama talks often on the campaign trail about being a  working mother. Until recently, she juggled a job as a hospital  executive with raising two young daughters and lending support  to her 46-year-old husband's political aspirations.      The strong-minded Obama exudes confidence and is an  accomplished public speaker. But her penchant for outspokenness  has also drawn some criticism.      McCain, 54, the Arizona senator's second wife, is reserved  and seems far less comfortable in the limelight when she  campaigns with her husband, who is 18 years her senior.           RODEO QUEEN      The blond, blue-eyed McCain is a former rodeo queen and  cheerleader who holds a master's degree in special education  from the University of Southern California. She grew up in a  wealthy family in Phoenix and is heiress to Hensley & Co, one  of the largest U.S. distributors for brewing giant  Anheuser-Busch.      Last month, she released a tax return showing she made  about $6 million in 2006.      McCain has raised four children, including a daughter  Bridget, 16, whom she adopted from Mother Teresa's orphanage in  Bangladesh. McCain has traveled the globe as part of her  charitable work.      McCain's deferential manner puts her in the company of more  traditional first ladies such as Nancy Reagan and Laura Bush.      'She is more in the classic mold of the candidate's wife on  the campaign trail,' said Calvin Jillson, a political scientist  at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.      He said McCain has her own version of the 'Nancy Reagan  stare,' the adoring gaze that the former first lady perfected.      'If you look at Michelle Obama, it appears that throughout  their married life, she and her husband have been very much  equals,' Jillson said. Her image as an equal partner was on  display with the celebratory fist-bump the Obamas shared on the  night he clinched the nomination last week.      America has had nontraditional first ladies before. They  included Rosalynn Carter, wife of Jimmy Carter who sat in on  Cabinet meetings, and Hillary Clinton, who was named by her  husband to lead a health-care task force.      Obama met her husband through her work as a corporate  lawyer and is his closest adviser, although associates have  described her role as less of a policy-oriented one than that  of a confidante who provides a reality check.      She has acquired an image as a tough-minded task-master.      In a favorite line on the campaign trail, the Illinois  senator says his wife of",

The problem is she's been silent, letting others speak for her.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDAVID AXELROD, BARACK OBAMA'S CHIEF STRATEGIST: She gives this talk all the time, and I don't think she formulates the words quite that way generally. But if you look at the whole quote and read beyond it, she was plainly talking about this burst of participation, this sense of hope, the sense of possibility and so on. And she was talking about the politics of our country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOK, fine. But again, Michelle Obama should be explaining herself, not paid advisers.\n\nWhy is an explanation needed, you might ask? Well, because most Americans are proud of their country and don't like it see it run down in any way. Michelle Obama is a prominent person. What she says carries weight all over the world. Also, what she says can be used against her.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCINDY MCCAIN, JOHN MCCAIN'S WIFE: I'm proud of my country. I don't know about you, if you heard those words earlier. I'm very proud of my country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWell, the fact that Michelle Obama has not clarified the situation is a major mistake for the Obama campaign.\n\nAgain, I don't believe Michelle Obama dislikes her country. I sincerely hope she does not, but this is a big deal. It is not going away. And the Obama campaign should understand that.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads and Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

      "Text": "    By Deborah Charles      WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama's fiery   campaign style belies the fact that she was hesitant at first  about getting involved in her husband Barack's bid to become  U.S. president.      Obama says she never expected to be on stage extolling her  husband's virtues, but she is revving up crowds as she tells  them he is the Democratic candidate who offers the best option  for change in the United States.      'I am very passionate about change in the country and  that's what you see,' the 44-year-old Princeton- and  Harvard-educated lawyer from Chicago told Reuters in an  interview last year.      The woman who would become America's first black first lady  if her husband wins the White House, has taken time off from  her job as a vice president of community relations at the  University of Chicago Hospitals to campaign.      She spends as much time as she can at home with daughters  Malia, 9, and Sasha, 6. She wants their lives to remain as  'normal' as possible, even though she has been hitting the  campaign trail for longer periods of time.      Though she joins her husband, 46, for major rallies, where  she is a popular warm-up act, Michelle Obama has her own  schedule of events -- usually in more intimate settings where  she can meet people and answer questions one-on-one.      'I am really worried that we won't make the right decision  this time around,' she said. 'And I'm really going to put  everything that I have into making sure that people understand  what's at stake and that we are thinking with our heads and not  with fear.'           'LOVE OF MY LIFE'      Barack Obama often speaks about her. In his victory  speeches in recent primaries he has given special thanks to  'the love of my life, the rock of the Obama family, the closer  on the campaign trail.'      In turn, Michelle Obama gets loud cheers when she appears  on stage with her husband, often predicting as she introduces  him: 'He's going to be the best president that we have seen in  a long time.'      Michelle Obama did her undergraduate studies at Princeton  University, where she earned a degree in sociology with a minor  in African-American studies.      She went on to Harvard Law School, then worked in a  corporate law firm in Chicago.      It was there she met Barack in 1988. Although he is three  years older, her husband spent several years working as a  community organizer before going to law school. As a new  lawyer, Michelle was assigned as his adviser.      They began dating soon after and were married in 1992.      Obama regularly says he is lucky his wife never decided to  run for office. In his book 'The Audacity of Hope,' he wrote,  'If I ever had to run against her for public office, she would  beat me without much difficulty.'

      "Text": "    By Matthew Bigg      ATLANTA, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama brings the skills  of a corporate lawyer to the White House as first lady to  President-elect Barack Obama, but she says her priority will be  her role as 'mom-in-chief' to the couple's two daughters.      Democrat Obama beat Republican John McCain in Tuesday's  election. He will be the first black U.S. president and his  wife the first black first lady.      Michelle Obama, 44, was a passionate advocate for her  husband's candidacy, but she says she would not want a direct  policy role in an Obama administration.      'My first job, in all honesty, is going to continue to be  'mom-in-chief,'' she said in a recent magazine interview  referring to daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7.      She also says she hopes to focus ways women maintain a  work-family balance and the needs of military families, and she  could act as an informal adviser to her husband as she has been  during the campaign.      Obama, who grew up in a blue-collar neighborhood on the  south side of Chicago and went to public school, often talks  about her father -- who worked for the city's public water  system -- and the values instilled by her parents.      After winning scholarships to the elite universities of  Princeton and Harvard law school, Obama worked for a law firm  and in the Chicago mayor's office.      Her most recent job was vice president of the University of  Chicago hospitals, where she earned more than her husband. Even  though the Obamas are now well off, partly due to royalties  from Barack Obama's two books, Michelle Obama stresses the  values she learned growing up.      'When you are raised in a home ... (in which) you have love  and security and you have people who are sacrificing for you  ... you have an obligation to give back,' she said. 'That's why  community service has been such a big part of my life.'           'PROUD OF MY COUNTRY'      In his victory speech Tuesday night, Barack Obama described  his wife as 'my best friend for the last 16 years, the rock of  our family, the love of my life.' He says she has been a source  of strength and a gentle critic who keeps him grounded.      Their public displays of affection and her fashion sense --  she has been featured in magazines such as Vogue  and Essence  -- contribute to the candidate's youthful image.      In a widely praised speech at the Democratic National  Convention, Michelle Obama shared details of the couple's life  together and said her husband represented typical American  values.      'What struck me when I first met Barack was that even  though he had this funny name, and even though he'd grown up  all the way across the continent in Hawaii, his family was so  much like mine,' she said.      'He was raised by grandparents who were working-class folks  like my parents, and by a single mother who struggled to pay  the bills just like we did.'      Michelle Obama has receded from the limelight since the  convention, even though she draws large crowds while  campaigning solo for her husband.      She is immensely popular with Democrats who warm to the  strength and smartness she projects, but in February she  stirred controversy with comments she made on the campaign  trail.      'For the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud  of my country,' she told an audience in Wisconsin. 'And not  just because Barack has done well, but because I think people  are hungry for change.'      Conservatives criticized h",

In turn, Michelle Obama gets loud cheers when she appears  on stage with her husband, often predicting as she introduces  him: 'He's going to be the best president that we have seen in  a long time.'      In an interview on Monday, Michelle Obama was asked if she  would support Sen. Hillary Clinton if she won the Democratic  nomination.      'I have to think about that,' she said on ABC's Good  Morning America. 'I'd have to think about her policies, her  approach, her tone.'      Michelle Obama did her undergraduate studies at Princeton  University, where she earned a degree in sociology with a minor  in African-American studies.      She went on to Harvard Law School, then worked in a  corporate law firm in Chicago.      It was there she met Barack in 1988. Although he is three  years older, her husband spent several years working as a  community organizer before going to law school. As a new  lawyer, Michelle was assigned as his adviser.      They began dating soon after and were married in 1992.      Obama regularly says he is lucky his wife never decided to  run for office. In his book 'The Audacity of Hope,' he wrote,  'If I ever had to run against her for public office, she would  beat me without much difficulty.'

      "Text": "    By Matthew Bigg      ATLANTA, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama will bring the  skills of a corporate lawyer to the White House if her husband  wins the U.S. presidency, but she says her priority will be her  role as 'mom-in-chief' to the couple's daughters.      Democrat Barack Obama faces Republican John McCain in  Tuesday's election. If the first-term Illinois senator wins, he  will become the first black U.S. president and his wife the  first black first lady.      Michelle Obama, 44, is a passionate advocate for her  husband's candidacy, but she says she would not want a direct  policy role in an Obama administration.      'My first job, in all honesty, is going to continue to be  'mom-in-chief,'' she said in a recent magazine interview  refering to daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7.      She also says she hopes to focus ways women maintain a  work-family balance and the needs of military families and she  could act as an informal adviser to her husband as she has been  during the campaign.      Obama, who grew up in a blue-collar neighborhood on the  south side of Chicago and went to public school, often talks  about her father -- who worked for the city's public water  system -- and the values instilled by her parents.      After winning scholarships to the elite universities of  Princeton and Harvard law school, Obama worked for a law firm  and in the Chicago mayor's office.      Her most recent job was vice president of the University of  Chicago hospitals, where she earned more than her husband. Even  though the Obamas are now well off, partly due to royalties  from Barack Obama's two books, Michelle Obama stresses the  values she learned growing up.      'When you are raised in a home ... (in which) you have love  and security and you have people who are sacrificing for you  ... you have an obligation to give back,' she said. 'That's why  community service has been such a big part of my life.'           'PROUD OF MY COUNTRY'      Barack Obama describes his wife as his 'rock,' a source of  strength and a gentle critic who keeps him grounded. Their  public displays of affection and her fashion sense -- she has  been featured in magazines such as Vogue  and Essence --  contribute to the candidate's youthful image.      In a widely praised speech at the Democratic National  Convention, Michelle Obama shared details of the couple's life  together and said her husband represented typical American  values.      'What struck me when I first met Barack was that even  though he had this funny name, and even though he'd grown up  all the way across the continent in Hawaii, his family was so  much like mine,' she said.      'He was raised by grandparents who were working-class folks  like my parents, and by a single mother who struggled to pay  the bills just like we did.'      Michelle Obama has receded from the limelight since her  convention speech, even though she draws large crowds while  campaigning solo for her husband.      In February, she stirred controversy with comments she made  on the campaign trail.      'For the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud  of my country,' she told an audience in Wisconsin. 'And not  just because Barack has done well, but because I think people  are hungry for change.'      Conservatives criticized her as insufficiently patriotic  and the dispute angered some black Americans who said they are  held to a higher standard of patriotism.

      "Text": "    NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama wrote a  thank-you note to Laura Bush after the first lady spoke up in  defense of the wife of the Democratic presidential candidate,  Obama said on Wednesday.      Obama, who is married to Illinois Sen. Barack Obama,  created a controversy on the campaign trail in February when  she said, 'For the first time in my adult lifetime I am really  proud of my country.'      After critics questioned her patriotism because of the  remark, Obama has frequently said she is proud of her country.      During an appearance on ABC Television's 'The View' on  Wednesday, she re-stated her pride in the United States and  said her controversial comment was referring to being proud of  the political process this year.      Laura Bush came to Obama's defense earlier this month,  telling ABC's 'Good Morning America': 'I think she probably  meant, 'I'm more proud.' You have to be very careful in what  you say. Everything you say is looked at and in many cases  misconstrued.'      Obama said she appreciated Bush's comments and concern.      'I was touched by it and actually I sent her a note,' Obama  said on 'The View.' 'It took me a while to write it. Like, how  do I address her? I sent it to 'Madam First Lady.' I don't want  to talk about it because she might not have it yet.      'That's what I like about Laura Bush, her whole rational  approach to these issues. I am taking some cues. There's a  reason why people like her, because she doesn't sort of fuel  the fire.'

      "Text": "    By Martinne Geller      NEW YORK, Feb 16 (Reuters) - First lady Michelle Obama is  widely hailed as a fashion icon, but industry insiders say  she's quite the opposite, and that's a good thing.      A fashion icon would have an eye-catching signature look  and, while the president's wife has the power to set trends,  her appeal is refreshingly not so defined and deliberate, said  fashion observers at the semi-annual Fashion Week in New York,  where designers are showing their Fall 2009 collections.      Michelle Obama 'is more real than iconic,' said David  Wolfe, creative director of the Doneger Group, which forecasts  trends. 'She doesn't have a locked-in fashion look. She  experiments, which is what fashion is about these days.'      References to Obama, 45, as an icon of fashion are  everywhere. Thin and statuesque, the attorney and mother of two  graces the cover of Vogue magazine's March issue.      She wins lavish attention from designers, editors and  stylists. Stores quickly sell out of the clothes she wears.      While Obama's style merits praise, she is not in the ranks  of such icons as actress Katharine Hepburn, with her tailored  menswear, or Jacqueline Kennedy with her pillbox hats and  wide-frame sunglasses, said Helen Job, a trend forecaster with  WGSN, a fashion research and analysis firm.      'When you think about a fashion icon, it's somebody who has  this ability to influence the public to such a degree ... to  change the direction (a style) is going in,' she said.      Kennedy's sense of style would be out of place among women  today, said Wolfe.      'Jackie Kennedy was locked into the Jackie Kennedy look and  never stepped out of it. That was great, but it certainly isn't  the way modern women dress,' he said.      Obama wears clothes by little-known designers and  mid-priced chains such as J Crew Group Inc <JCG.N>, helping  dispose of the idea that first ladies always must look formal.      'She's really set this new guideline, and I feel like the  White House will never be the same after this somehow,' said  Gloria Baume, fashion director for Teen Vogue.         DEMOCRATIC FASHION     Jason Wu, the young designer of Obama's white inaugural gown  and the magenta dress she wears in Vogue, credits the first  lady with reinvigorating the industry.     'In her own way, she is like a stimulus package for the  fashion industry,' Wu said.      Few first ladies deserved the title as fashion icons, said  Mandi Norwood, a former magazine editor writing a book on  Obama's style.      'We've been trying desperately to promote the first lady  into fashion icon status, but I'm not sure any of them have  truly deserved that title,' she said.      Obama does have some company in U.S. history, said Lisa  Kathleen Graddy, curator of 'The First Ladies at the  Smithsonian' exhibit.      Frances Cleveland's clothes and hairstyle were copied and  commented upon, and advertisers used her to sell products she  had never seen or used. The Victorian-era bustle even fell out  of U.S. fashion when it was reported she would no longer wear  the rear-enhancing gowns.      Another fashionable first lady was Grace Coolidge, who is  considered to have popularized fashion, said Graddy.      Grover Cleveland was president in the late 1800s. Calvin  Coolidge served in the 1920s.

      "Text": "  (Recasts with details of inaugural ball dress, new quotes)      By Jill Serjeant      LOS ANGELES, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama officially  entered the world stage on Tuesday in outfits by U.S. designers  paired with off-the-rack accessories, mixing glamour with  practicality.      The first lady chose a sparkling sheath dress and matching  coat in yellow-gold by Cuban-born designer Isabel Toledo for  the swearing-in ceremony but added olive green gloves from  chain store J.Crew and Jimmy Choo shoes.      For the inaugural balls, she wore a white, one-shouldered  chiffon gown with a full skirt by Taiwan-born U.S. designer  Jason Wu, 26, whose dresses cost up to $6,000.      'How good looking is my wife?,' President Barack Obama  asked the crowd at the first of 10 inaugural balls attended by  the couple.      Michelle Obama's clothing choices were expected to provide  clues to the way she will undertake her role as first lady in a  time of deep recession.      A former lawyer, Michelle Obama, 45, has won kudos for her  chic, youthful style, mixing chain store garments with edgy  designers like Chicago's Mario Pinto and Narciso Rodriguez.      Her daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, both wore J. Crew  coats to the presidential swearing-in ceremony.      Obama won praise in June by wearing a $148 black and white  off-the-rack dress for appearing on the TV chat show 'The  View.' It sold out nationwide overnight.      Her yellow swearing-in outfit was a departure from red,  white or blue tones often adopted by U.S. female politicians  and spouses. Yellow is seen in many parts of the world as a  symbol of hope and optimism.           'RADIATED HOPE AND OPTIMISM'      But Obama's choice did not get universal approval. An  online poll on the Us Weekly celebrity magazine site showed 55  percent of readers hated the outfit and 44 percent loved it.      Bonnie Fuller, former editor in chief of Glamour magazine,  called the outfit bold but wondered on www.huffingtonpost.com:  'Is she walking around in inaugural upholstery?'       New York-based designer Toledo, 47, said the coat and  dress were made of Swiss wool lace, backed with netting for  warmth and lined in French silk.      'For me yellow represents hope,' Toledo told Reuters. 'It  really feels like freshness to me. I wanted to capture  optimism, I wanted it to feel happy, I wanted it to feel  inclusive.'      Her ball gown, which will go on show at the Smithsonian,  received a mixed reaction with U.S. fashion bible Women's Wear  Daily saying it made the Obamas look like newlyweds.      'But Michelle Obama is rewriting the fashion rules and she  looks every inch the style icon she is becoming,' wrote the Los  Angeles Times.      In hard times, fashion commentators expected Obama to avoid  anything too glitzy or frivolous. But dressing down too much  could have attracted as much criticism as extravagance.      Former first lady Rosalynn Carter was criticized during the  1970s oil crisis for wearing her previously worn, off-the-rack  gown to the 1977 inaugural ball.      In 1981, Nancy Reagan was deemed 'too Hollywood' with her  white, one-shoulder, lace satin sheath with crystal beads.      Obama is already considered an ambassador for American  fashion. She was listed in Vanity Fair's magazine's '10 of the  World's Best Dressed People' in both 2007 and 2008 and has  drawn numerous comparisons with Jacqueline Kennedy.

      "Text": " (Adds further comments paragraphs 9-10)      By Jill Serjeant      LOS ANGELES, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama, hailed by  many as America's new style icon, officially took her place on  the world stage on Tuesday wearing an outfit in the  nontraditional color of yellow and set fashionistas atwitter.      The new U.S. first lady, 45, chose a sparkling sheath dress  and matching coat in a yellow-gold hue by Cuban-born American  designer Isabel Toledo for the presidential swearing-in  ceremony. She matched it with a wide diamante necklace.      What she will wear to the formal inaugural ball later on   Tuesday remained a tightly held secret. But her choice is  expected to provide clues to her future balancing act as   glamorous first lady in a time of deep recession.      Michelle Obama, a former lawyer, has been credited with   bringing a chic, youthful style to U.S. politics and for mixing  comfortable chain store garments from the likes of Gap and J.  Crew with edgier new designers like Chicago's Mario Pinto and   Narciso Rodriguez.      Initially seen as slightly aloof, she won hearts in June by  wearing an affordable $148 black and white off-the-rack dress  for an appearance on the popular female TV chat show 'The  View.' It sold out nationwide overnight.      Her swearing-in outfit was a departure from the red, white  or blue tones often adopted by U.S. female politicians on  high-profile occasions.      Yellow is traditionally seen in many parts of the world as  a symbol of hope and optimism, style experts said.        'RADIATED HOPE AND OPTIMISM'      'Yellow is the color of optimism and confidence and hope  ... The whole ensemble radiated hope and optimism,' Mandi  Norwood, a former editor at Mademoiselle magazine who is  writing a book on Michelle Obama's style, told Reuters      But Obama's choice did not get a universal thumbs up. An  online poll on the Us Weekly celebrity magazine site showed 55  percent of readers hated the outfit and 44 percent loved it.      Bonnie Fuller, former editor in chief of Glamour magazine,  called it 'bold' but wondered, 'Is she walking around in  inaugural upholstery?' Fuller wrote in a blog on the  www.huffingtonpost.com Web site that she had heard one observer  quipping that the first lady was 'wearing a couch.'      New York-based designer Toledo said the coat and dress were  made of Swiss wool lace, backed with netting for warmth on the  bitterly cold Washington morning, and lined in French silk.      'I wanted to pick a very optimistic color, that had  sunshine,' Toledo told New York Times fashion critic Cathy  Horyn on Tuesday. 'I wanted her to feel charmed, and in that  way would charm everybody.'      With home foreclosures and layoffs plaguing Americans  across the United States, fashion commentators expect Obama to  go for understated glamour at the 10 inauguration galas she  will attend, wearing nothing too glitzy or frivolous.      Dressing down too much could attract as much criticism as  extravagance.      Former first lady Rosalynn Carter was criticized during the  1970s oil crisis for wearing her previously worn, off-the-rack  gown to the 1977 inaugural ball.      In 1981, Nancy Reagan was deemed 'too Hollywood' with her  white, one-shoulder, lace satin sheath with crystal beads.      Los Angeles Times fashion critic Booth Moore doubted  Michelle Obama would take the Rosalyn Carter line for her  inaugural ball dress.      'At least for one night, we want our first lady to be ",

      "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama graces the  cover of next month's Vogue magazine, marking the second time a  U.S. first lady has appeared on the front of one of the world's  leading fashion magazines.      Obama, 45, who has been hailed by both U.S. retailers and  the media as a new fashion icon, donned a magenta sheath dress  for the cover photo. The dress was designed by Jason Wu, who  also created her white inaugural ball gown.      Famed photographer Annie Leibovitz took the cover photo and  several fashion shots featured inside the March edition of  Vogue.      With the exception of Bess Truman, every U.S. first lady  since Lou Hoover in the 1930s has been featured in Vogue, but  Obama is only the second presidential wife to appear on the  cover, Vogue said. Hillary Clinton did so in 1998.      Obama has won praise from fashionistas for mixing designer  pieces with off-the-rack American brands like J. Crew and Gap.       Vogue's editor-at-large, Andre Leon Talley said Obama  selected the outfits worn for the photo shoot herself, from her  own wardrobe, pairing designer wear with affordable clothes.      'She doesn't need any help. She loves fashion and knows  what works for her. She's never had a conversation with me  about, 'What do you think?' or 'How did this look?' And I'm  glad for that.'       Obama told Vogue she loved clothes, but said comfort and  fun was more important than following fashion.      'First and foremost, I wear what I love. That's what women  have to focus on: what makes them happy and what makes them  feel comfortable and beautiful. If I can have any impact, I  want women to feel good about themselves and have fun with  fashion,' she said.      While Obama discussed her views on fashion, she made clear  family was her first priority, particularly caring for  daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7.      'I'm going to try to take them to school every morning, as  much as I can,' Obama told the magazine. 'But there's also a  measure of independence. And obviously there will be times I  won't be able to drop them off at all. I like to be a presence  in my kids' school. I want to know the teachers; I want to know  the other parents,' she said.

      "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Feb 25 (Reuters Life!) - Few things are as  sweet to a parent as family meals and bedtime with the kids,  and those are two reasons Michelle Obama says her new life at  the White House is comforting.      Well, those and a little exercise.      In an interview for the March 9 issue of People magazine,  the First Lady reveals some details of her family life in the  month since President Barack Obama was inaugurated, and they  moved their daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7 into 1600  Pennsylvania Ave. in Washington, D.C.      After more than a year living out of suitcases and in hotel  rooms on the campaign trail, Michelle Obama says the family now  has dinner together every night, where they talk about the  highs and lows of their day. Later the president is able to  tuck his children into bed before they drift off to sleep.      'We haven't had that kind of time together for (years), so  that explains a lot why we all feel so good in this space,' the  First Lady told People magazine.      Among their daily routine is exercise for her and her  husband at 5:30 in the morning and breakfast together before  their respective days begin. She said the secrets to their  successful marriage include being able to laugh together and  his ability to stay calm under stress.      But she stopped well short of saying they are a model of  married perfection. 'I don't want anybody to think it's easy.  It works because we really work at it ... We have a strong  marriage, but it's not perfect.'      She did say her husband has quit smoking, for now, and that  Malia and Sasha must still do their chores -- make their beds,  clean their rooms and clear the dishes from the dinner table.      'People (here) want to make your life easy, and when you  have small kids -- I've explained this to the staff -- they  don't need their lives to be easy. They're kids,' she said.      And what about the president's promise to get a dog for the  girls? The First Lady said it is on the way, but is waiting  until April, after the girls have had their spring break from  school. But she has a problem -- the name.      The girls have come up with several ideas, including Frank  and Moose, but mom Obama is not going for those. 'I'm like, no.  Come on. Let's work with the names a little bit,' she said.

      "Text": "    By Caren Bohan      WASHINGTON, June 10 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama and Cindy  McCain share a dislike of rough-edged U.S. politics. Each tried  to talk her spouse out of running for the White House.      Obama, wife of Democratic candidate Barack Obama, and  McCain, who is married to Republican John McCain, are both  known for an elegant sense of style, lending glamour to their  husbands' campaigns.      McCain posed in size zero jeans for the latest issue of  Vogue. Obama, who has also appeared in the fashion magazine,  was praised by style writers for the violet sheath dress she  wore to her husband's Democratic nomination victory rally and  has been compared to former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy.      But the aspiring first ladies have plenty of differences.      Obama, 44, is a Princeton- and Harvard-educated lawyer  raised by blue-collar parents on the working-class South Side  of Chicago. She would be the first African American U.S. first  lady.      Obama talks often on the campaign trail about being a  working mother. Until recently, she juggled a job as a hospital  executive with raising two young daughters and lending support  to her 46-year-old husband's political aspirations.      The strong-minded Obama exudes confidence and is an  accomplished public speaker. But her penchant for outspokenness  has also drawn some criticism.      McCain, 54, the Arizona senator's second wife, is reserved  and seems far less comfortable in the limelight when she  campaigns with her husband, who is 18 years her senior.           RODEO QUEEN      The blond, blue-eyed McCain is a former rodeo queen and  cheerleader who holds a master's degree in special education  from the University of Southern California. She grew up in a  wealthy family in Phoenix and is heiress to Hensley & Co, one  of the largest U.S. distributors for brewing giant  Anheuser-Busch.      Last month, she released a tax return showing she made  about $6 million in 2006.      McCain has raised four children, including a daughter  Bridget, 16, whom she adopted from Mother Teresa's orphanage in  Bangladesh. McCain has traveled the globe as part of her  charitable work.      McCain's deferential manner puts her in the company of more  traditional first ladies such as Nancy Reagan and Laura Bush.      'She is more in the classic mold of the candidate's wife on  the campaign trail,' said Calvin Jillson, a political scientist  at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.      He said McCain has her own version of the 'Nancy Reagan  stare,' the adoring gaze that the former first lady perfected.      'If you look at Michelle Obama, it appears that throughout  their married life, she and her husband have been very much  equals,' Jillson said. Her image as an equal partner was on  display with the celebratory fist-bump the Obamas shared on the  night he clinched the nomination last week.      America has had nontraditional first ladies before. They  included Rosalynn Carter, wife of Jimmy Carter who sat in on  Cabinet meetings, and Hillary Clinton, who was named by her  husband to lead a health-care task force.      Obama met her husband through her work as a corporate  lawyer and is his closest adviser, although associates have  described her role as less of a policy-oriented one than that  of a confidante who provides a reality check.      She has acquired an image as a tough-minded task-master.      In a favorite line on the campaign trail, the Illinois  senator says his wife of",

      "Text": "    By Deborah Charles      WASHINGTON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - First lady Laura Bush shared  some tips with Michelle Obama on how to survive in the White  House -- particularly with young daughters -- and gave her  successor a tour of the mansion that will soon become her  home.      Less than one week after Barack Obama won a historic  election to succeed President George W. Bush on Jan. 20, the  Obamas paid a visit to the White House on Monday.      After the two couples greeted with kisses and handshakes   at the executive mansion's South Portico, they went briefly  inside for a look around together before heading off in   opposite directions.      Obama stepped into the Oval Office, ushered in by Bush. He  later described the center of American power as 'a really nice  office.'      'It was a bit of a momentous day,' Obama spokesman Robert  Gibbs told reporters on a flight from Washington to Chicago. 'I  don't know that I would characterize him awe struck.'      While their husbands sat down in the Oval Office, Mrs. Bush  took Mrs. Obama on a tour of the first family residence on the  second and third levels of the mansion.      They visited every room, said Mrs. Bush's spokeswoman,  Sally McDonough.      She said the women, who were meeting each other for the  first time, spent time in the rooms that would likely become  the bedrooms of the younger Obamas: 10-year-old Malia and  7-year-old Sasha.      'They did talk about their children and how the first lady  can change the decor of any of the rooms in the private  residence,' said McDonough.      The women also spoke about how best to handle having  daughters grow up in the fishbowl of the White House. The  Bush's twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, spent part of their  teenage years in the White House. Though the Bushes tried to  make sure their daughters were kept out of the news, they did  make headlines a few times for under-age drinking.      'I think Mrs. Bush is giving her some really good advice on  that and how they can truly have a home here at the White  House, enjoy all that Washington, D.C., has to offer, and raise  their family here,' McDonough said on Fox News.      Gibbs said Bush also showed Obama some of the main  attractions of the White House. They went to the Lincoln  Bedroom, saw the private workspace for the president in the  residence and visited one area close to the heart of both men  -- the gym.      When questioned if there was some tension in the room,  partly because Obama got so much mileage during the campaign by  vowing to bring a change from 'the failed policies of George W.  Bush,' Gibbs said the encounter with Bush was cordial and  pleasant.      'I don't think he tried that line out again to see how it  would work,' Gibbs said with a laugh.

      "Text": "Barack Obama\u2019s wife, Michelle, is under fire for leaving the impression that she hasn\u2019t been proud of her country until now, when Democrats are beginning to rally around her husband\u2019s campaign.\n\nSpeaking in Milwaukee, Wis., on Monday, she said, \u201cPeople in this country are ready for change and hungry for a different kind of politics and \u2026 for the first time in my adult life I am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback.\u201d\n\nGreeted with rousing applause after making the comment in Milwaukee, Obama delivered an amended version of the speech later that day in Madison, Wis.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in my adult lifetime, I\u2019m really proud of my country \u2026 not just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry for change,\u201d she said. \u201cI have been desperate to see our country moving in that direction and just not feeling so alone in my frustration and disappointment.\u201d\n\nObama was born in 1964, meaning her adult life began in 1982. Critics quickly seized on the newfound national pride.\n\n\u201cI am proud of my country,\u201d John McCain\u2019s wife, Cindy, said at a campaign stop in Brookfield, Wis., Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you heard those words earlier \u2026 but I am very proud of my country.\u201d\n\nDuring a follow up press conference, the Arizona senator was asked if they were responding to Michelle Obama and he deferred to his wife.\n\nMcCain responded: \u201cI just wanted to make the statement that I have and always will be proud of my country.\u201d\n\nObama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the candidate\u2019s wife wasn\u2019t trying to knock her country, only underscore the meaning behind her husband\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cThe point is that of course Michelle is proud of her country, which is why she and Barack talk constantly about how their story wouldn\u2019t be possible in any other nation on Earth,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat she meant is that she\u2019s really proud at this moment because for the first time in a long time, thousands of Americans who\u2019ve never participated in politics before are coming out in record numbers to build a grassroots movement for change.\u201d\n\nBut conservative outlets aren\u2019t so ready to let her off the hook.\n\n\u201cCan it really be there has not been a moment during that time when she felt proud of her country?\u201d reads an article in Commentary magazine. \u201cForget matters like the victory in the Cold War; how about only things that have made liberals proud \u2014 all the accomplishments of inclusion? How about the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991? Or Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s elevation to the Supreme Court?\u201d\n\nThe article then says Michelle Obama\u2019s comments suggest \u201cthe pseudo-messianic nature of the Obama candidacy is very much a part of the way the Obamas themselves are feeling.\u201d\n\nWeekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol said the comment \u201cwas sort of revealing.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was an adult when we won the Cold War without firing a shot. She was an adult for the last 25 years of economic progress, social progress,\u201d he told FOX News. \u201cI think the Democrats have to be careful \u2026 they\u2019re running against the status quo \u2026 You have to be careful not to let that slide into a kind of indictment of America. Because I don\u2019t think the American people think on the whole that the last 25 years of American history is a narrative of despair and nothing to be proud of.\u201d\n\nDemocratic strategist Bob Beckel said Obama \u201cshouldn\u2019t have said it the way she said it\u201d but she gets the benefit of his doubt. He added that she most likely was just referring to the grassroots movement that\u2019s swelled to support her husband, but she needs to be more careful.\n\n\u201cThe Obama\u2019s have to recognize they are now front-runners, and everything they say, it\u2019s now open hunting season for people,\u201d he said.\n\nClick here to see the video of Michelle Obama talking in Madison about being proud of her country for the first time.\n\nClick here to read the posting on the Commentary Web site.\n\nFOX News\u2019 Mosheh Oinounou and Bonney Kapp contributed to this report.",

      "Text": "    By Michelle Nichols      NEW YORK, Nov 7 (Reuters) - All ears were listening to U.S.  President-elect Barack Obama's victory speech this week but  fashion-watchers were looking closely at his wife Michelle's  dress -- and the verdict was not so good.      Despite comparisons during the campaign to stylish 1960s  first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, Michelle Obama was derided in  opinion polls for her choice of a black and neon-red dress from  Narciso Rodriguez's spring 2009 ready-to-wear collection.      In an online poll by USA Today, 65 percent of more than  10,000 readers believed the Harvard-educated corporate lawyer  and future first lady 'had an off day' and 35 percent said 'She  looks fantastic as always.'      An online poll by People magazine mirrored those results,  while a Los Angeles Times online poll found 45 percent hated  the dress and 34 percent loved it.      'The normally impeccable Michelle O made a questionable  choice for her husband's historic election night victory,'  wrote Lesley Scott, editor of fashion and lifestyle blog  www.fashiontribes.com. 'It's less than flattering.'      'However, every fashionista worth her salt takes risks,'  Scott said, 'which means the occasional misstep.'      Not everyone disliked Obama's choice, which was shown on  the catwalk only two months ago and is not yet available in  stores. New York magazine hailed Obama for being able to hold  her own against France's first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, a  former supermodel.      'We have a feeling she'll continue to mix affordable pieces  with designer pieces as First Lady, but this wardrobe choice  proves this woman knows fashion and we have an exciting four  years of political fashion ahead of us,' the magazine said.      'What will she choose for the inaugural ball? The suspense  is so exciting! And you know what else is great about this? We  don't have to envy France for Carla Bruni anymore!'      Interest in Obama's fashion has soared since she won  particular praise for the purple sheath dress and black belt  she wore in June when her husband clinched the nomination as  the Democratic Party's presidential candidate.      While Republican candidate John McCain's wife Cindy and his  vice presidential running mate Sarah Palin drew criticism for  their high-end wardrobes, Obama won fans for affordable style.      Obama wore a $150 dress on 'The View' talk show, which  became an instant hit. For 'The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'  last week, she donned an outfit from chain store J.Crew.      She has even inspired a website -- www.mrs-o.org --  dedicated to taking 'a regular look at what and who she's  wearing' and encouraging enthusiasm for 'the budding style  icon, Mrs O.'      Obama already has a fashion track record, appearing in  Vogue and being named twice on Vanity Fair's international  best-dressed list.

      "Text": "    By Bob Tourtellotte      LOS ANGELES, Sept 17 (Reuters Life!) - She fills two  converted bedrooms with clothes -- one for casual and a second  for glam -- and staying organized worked for singer Fergie who on  Wednesday made People magazine's 2008 list of best dressed women.      'I don't like to throw anything away,' Fergie said about the  clothes in her 'closets' for People's widely-watched Best & Worst  Dressed 2008 issue that hits newsstands this Friday.      Joining Fergie, whose hits include 'Glamorous,' in the top 10  list were actresses Kate Hudson, Anne Hathaway, Gwyneth Paltrow,  Charlize Theron and Eva Mendes. Singer/actress Jennifer Lopez,  singer Rihanna and supermodel Heidi Klum also made the list.      Rounding out the top 10 -- and making a campaign statement  for fashion -- was Michelle Obama, wife of Democratic  presidential candidate Barack Obama, who was given high marks for  a look that was 'classic and confident.'      'She has a look. She works it with confidence, and she knows  what looks good on her,' said People's Style Editor Clarissa  Cruz.      But Obama played down the notion that her sense of style  might be anything close to couture, telling People: 'Some of my  favorite summer dresses are from Gap and H&M.'      'The thing they all have in common is that they all had a  great year, stuck to their own personal style and stayed true to  that,' said Cruz.      The magazine's editors also spent time peering into the  fashion choices of Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah  Palin -- her rimless glasses, step-toe pumps and updo hairstyle.      'People are paying attention to what she's wearing, and we  felt that was a news story,' Cruz said.      Palin didn't talk to People, but her hairdresser did. She  said the candidate would rather not discuss style choices  'because she wants people to hear what she has to say.'     The makers of the Kazuo Kawasaki eye glasses favored by Palin  told People that demand has been 'overwhelming' and 'mostly from  the middle states.'      Then there are those fashion moments People would rather  forget.      The magazine's editors pick apart red carpet disaster dresses  worn by singer and 'American Idol' judge Paula Abdul and actress  Lucy Liu, as well as the aqua-and-orange boots and fedora favored  by Patricia Arquette.      'These were stumbles that were too over the top to ignore,'  Cruz said.      Other highlights of the double issue include best dressed  television show -- 'Gossip Girl' -- and most memorable style  moments including Lindsay Lohan's mink coat mixup in which she  left a party wearing another woman's $11,000 heirloom coat.

      "Text": "    By Jill Serjeant      LOS ANGELES, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Michelle Obama, hailed as  America's new style icon, officially took her place on the  world stage on Tuesday wearing yellow -- a nontraditional color  seen as embodying the hope of Barack Obama's campaign and  presidency.      The new U.S. first lady, 45, chose a sheath dress and  matching coat in a yellow-gold hue by Cuban-born American  designer Isabel Toledo for the presidential swearing-in  ceremony. She matched it with a wide diamante necklace.      What she will wear to the formal inaugural ball later on   Tuesday remained a tightly held secret. But her choice is  expected to provide clues to her future balancing act as   glamorous first lady in a time of deep recession.      Michelle Obama, a former lawyer, has been credited with   bringing a chic, youthful style to U.S. politics and for mixing  comfortable chain store garments from the likes of Gap and J.  Crew with edgier new designers like Chicago's Mario Pinto and   Narciso Rodriguez.      Initially seen as slightly aloof, she won hearts in June by  wearing an affordable $148 black and white off-the-rack dress  for an appearance on the popular female TV chat show 'The  View.' It sold out nationwide overnight.      Her swearing-in outfit was a departure from the red, white  or blue tones often adopted by U.S. female politicians on  high-profile occasions.      But yellow is traditionally seen in many parts of the world  as a symbol of hope and optimism, style experts said.        'RADIATED HOPE AND OPTIMISM'      'Yellow is the color of optimism and confidence and hope  ... The whole ensemble radiated hope and optimism,' Mandi  Norwood, a former editor at Mademoiselle magazine who is  writing a book on Michelle Obama's style, told Reuters      New York-based designer Toledo said the coat and dress were  made of Swiss wool lace, backed with netting for warmth on the  bitterly cold Washington morning, and lined in French silk.      'I wanted to pick a very optimistic color, that had  sunshine,' Toledo told New York Times fashion critic Cathy  Horyn on Tuesday. 'I wanted her to feel charmed, and in that  way would charm everybody.'      With home foreclosures and layoffs plaguing Americans  across the United States, fashion commentators expect Obama to  go for understated glamour at the 10 inauguration galas she  will attend, wearing nothing too glitzy or frivolous.      Dressing down too much could attract as much criticism as  extravagance.      Former First Lady Rosalynn Carter was criticized during the  1970s oil crisis for her frugal, previously worn, off-the-rack  gown to the 1977 inaugural ball.      In 1981, Nancy Reagan was deemed 'too Hollywood' with her  white, one-shoulder, lace satin sheath with crystal beads.      Los Angeles Times fashion critic Booth Moore doubted  Michelle Obama would take the Rosalyn Carter line for her  inaugural ball dress.      'At least for one night, we want our first lady to be more  glamorous than the rest of us. We don't want her to be  Secondhand Rose, but we don't want her to be Marie Antoinette  either. The secret to Obama's sartorial success so far has been  walking the line between the two. Here's hoping she continues  to do so,' Moore wrote on Tuesday.      Obama is already considered an ideal ambassador for  American fashion. She was listed in Vanity Fair's magazine's  '10 of the World's Best Dressed People' in both 2007 and 2008  and has drawn numerous comparisons with Ja",

      "Text": " (Adds byline, details, new paragraphs: 2-5, 7-15)      By Joan Gralla      NEW YORK, Feb 12 (Reuters) - New York City should raise  taxes on wealthy individuals, cut spending by $500 million and  add 1,000 jobs by growing biotech firms with a $250,000 tax  credit, the city council's speaker said on Thursday.      Luxury apartment developments, which failed to find   buyers, could be turned into affordable homes with the city  negotiating the lowest possible price, council speaker  Christine Quinn told the council in her annual state of the  city address.      To help close a $4 billion deficit, the Democrat proposed  raising millions of dollars by buying the Internet domain name  '.NYC' and selling it as a new web address.      She further proposed that the city defer the purchase of  new cars for police officers by a year, merge agencies, forego  electronic road signs and stop marketing city jobs, she said.      Cutting 10 percent of the $117 million spent on  administration will pay for 250 more police officers or 40  senior centers.      Quinn proposed raising income taxes for the city's top 4  percent income-earners under three new brackets in a move that  would raise $1 billion. That would avoid the sales tax increase  Mayor Michael Bloomberg has proposed.      If the mayor approved the new rates, incomes of $297,000 to  $532,000 would be taxed at 4.25 percent, up from 3.683 percent.  Taxpayers who earn $532,000 to $1.2 million would pay 4.45  percent; above $1.2 million the rate would be 4.65 percent.      Households with incomes of up to $46,000 a year, who pay no  state or federal taxes, would save $321 on average because the  city would end its current 2.907 to 3.591 percent levy. But  middle-class income households, with annual incomes of up to  $106,000, would not benefit; they would still pay the exact  range of rates that working class families now pay.      The mayor, an independent, in January said he expected    the state to raise income taxes on rich individuals to close  its historic deficit and warned this could drive these  individuals to move to lower-tax areas.      'For those who say this will cause a mass migration of  millionaires to Westchester and New Jersey, the facts simply  don't bear that out,' Quinn said, citing a Princeton University  study that found less than 0.2 percent of its millionaires  pulled up stakes after an income tax hike.      Quinn's income tax plan and her criticisms of the mayor   were a departure. Civic advocates and council historians have  bashed Quinn, who was expected to seek the Democratic mayoral  nomination until Bloomberg decided to seek a third term, for  hewing too closely to the mayor's positions.      The speaker slammed the administration for giving up $4  billion a year in failed job-creating tax credits, and vowed to  stiffen controls. 'We've developed an honor system of corporate  welfare,' she said, noting the Board of Trade got almost $1  million of aid in 2000 but cut its workers to 170 from 4,731.      Though fiscal monitors praise Bloomberg's unpopular plan to  curb newly hired workers' pensions and charge health care  contributions, Quinn said only that unions must 'play their  part,' like homeowners paying higher property taxes.      To spur new small businesses, Quinn proposed a one-stop  application process and waiving permitting fees for 12 months.  The city should abolish a law requiring it to take the low bid  -- though its costs will rise -- to hire local f",

      "Text": "    By Steve Holland      KAUKAUNA, Wis., June 12 (Reuters) - Democratic presidential  hopeful Barack Obama on Thursday accused Republican John McCain  of mischaracterizing his tax plan and said most Americans would  not see taxes go up.      Obama, an Illinois senator, has drawn heavy fire from rival  Arizona Sen. McCain this week on the issue of taxes, with the  Republican repeatedly accusing Obama of seeking the largest  increase since World War Two.      'It's just not true,' Obama said at a town hall meeting in  rainy Wisconsin, telling a crowd inside a high school gymnasium  that Republicans have wrongly subjected him to charges of being  a 'tax-and-spend liberal.'      Obama, visiting a Midwestern state likely to be a  battleground in the race to the November presidential election,  is enjoying a modest bump in public opinion polls in the days  since dispatching rival Hillary Clinton from the Democratic  nominating contest.      A poll by NBC and the Wall Street Journal put him ahead of  McCain by 47 percent to 41 percent among registered voters.      Obama says he would raise taxes on Americans making  $250,000 a year or more and raise the capital gains tax for  those in higher income brackets while exempting small  investors. He would use the money to pay for a middle-class tax  cut of $1,000 a year.      McCain and other Republican leaders argue that any tax  increase at a time the U.S. economy is struggling could be  devastating.      Obama's campaign pointed to a study by the Tax Policy  Center that said his plan would offer middle-class families  three times the tax relief that they would receive under  McCain's plan.      The report said McCain would give tax cuts to the rich:  one-quarter of the benefits in McCain's plan go to households  making over $2.8 million annually      'Both John McCain and I favor tax cuts,' Obama said. 'No  matter what he says, both of us favor tax cuts. The difference  is that Senator McCain wants to continue the Bush tax code that  rewards wealth and I want to reform our tax code so it rewards  work.'      Obama called McCain's plan to continue President George W.  Bush's across-the-board tax cuts, and add corporate tax  reductions, fiscally irresponsible.      'You know, I often say that John McCain is running to serve  out George Bush's third term, but that's not fair to George  Bush, because the fact is Sen. McCain is now calling for this  new round of tax relief that is twice as expensive as the Bush  plan and three times as regressive,' Obama said.      Obama also took aim at a McCain statement on Wednesday in  which he appeared to play down a timetable for withdrawing U.S.  troops from Iraq. McCain said the most important factor was  keeping U.S. casualties low and reiterated that U.S. troops for  decades have played peace-keeping roles around the world.      The notion of leaving U.S. troops in Iraq 'in perpetuity'  ignored the burden placed on troops and their families from  repeated tours of duty and was also costly to the U.S. economy,  Obama said.

McCain went on the offensive quickly, criticizing Obama's  proposal to raise taxes on Americans who make more than  $250,000 a year and saying it would hurt small business owners  like a plumber named Joe who Obama met on the campaign trail.      'Why would you want to raise anybody's taxes right now?'  McCain asked Obama. 'We need to encourage businesses.'      Obama said his plan would cut taxes for 95 percent of  Americans and raise them on only a small slice of the most  high-income Americans, while McCain would give tax breaks to  oil and gas companies.      'We both want to cut taxes,' Obama, an Illinois senator,  said in their third and last White House debate at Hofstra  University. 'The difference is who we want to cut taxes for.'      McCain, an Arizona senator, entered the debate under  intense pressure to turn in a strong performance that could  turn around a presidential race that has shifted decisively in  Obama's favor after weeks of economic turmoil and plunging  stock markets.      Opinion polls three weeks before the Nov. 4 election show  more voters say they trust Obama's leadership on the economy,  which has dominated the campaign-trail discussion and dwarfed  McCain's expertise in foreign and military policy.

McCain in a speech in Washington accused Obama of seeking  the single largest tax increase since World War Two while  Obama, in a television interview, said he would increase taxes  on the wealthy and on stock profits to pay for a middle-class  tax cut of $1,000 a year.      'No matter which of us wins in November, there will be  change in Washington. The question is what kind of change?'  McCain told a conference for small businesses.      Obama told CNBC that he would raise taxes on Americans  making $250,000 a year or more and raise the capital gains tax  for those in higher income brackets while exempting small  investors. He said the U.S. economy has been 'out of balance  for too long.'      'The general principle of raising taxes on higher income  Americans, like myself, and providing relief to those who  haven't benefited as much from this new global economy, I  think, is a sound one,' Obama said.      But Obama, 46, said he would consider deferring some of the  tax increases, depending on the economic situation he inherits  from President George W. Bush should he win the November  election.      The differences on how to spur new growth in the sluggish  U.S. economy, at a time of rising unemployment, record-high  gasoline prices and a persistent housing crisis, represented a  key point of argument for the two candidates in their battle to  determine who wins the presidency.      Obama and other Democrats believe economic conditions,  including $4-a-gallon gasoline, will persuade many Americans to  vote for them in November. McCain wants to fight the election  on national security, which he considers his strength.           WOULD KEEP BUSH TAX CUTS      McCain, 71, vowed to maintain Bush's tax cuts, lower  corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 25 percent and allow  companies to expense new equipment and technology in their  first year.      He supported keeping capital gains taxes as they are now,  doubling a tax exemption for children, and phasing out the  Alternative Minimum Tax, which he said would save some 25  million middle-class families up to $2,000 in a year.      He said he could pay for the plan by cutting what he called  wasteful government spending, including ethanol and sugar  subsidies and weapons systems.      'We're going to scrub every agency of government and we're  going to make them justify their existence. And if they can't,  they're going to go out of existence,' he said on CNBC.      Democrats argue not enough cuts could be made in the  federal budget to pay for McCain's tax cuts, which Obama said  would total $300 billion.      'I've said that John McCain is running to serve out a third  Bush term, but the truth is when it comes to taxes, that's not  being fair to George Bush,' Obama told reporters in St. Louis,  where he traveled to talk up his proposals on revamping the  U.S. health care system.      McCain was equally dismissive of Obama's economic plan,  which he said would hurt the 100 million Americans who own  stock.      'Under Senator Obama's tax plan, Americans of ",

      "Text": "    NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - Democrat Barack Obama said he  would consider trimming corporate tax rates as part of a  simplification of the U.S. tax code if he is elected to the  White House, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.      Obama said the tax code had too many loopholes and other  special breaks for some companies.      'How much you pay in taxes as a corporation a lot of times  is going to depend on how good your lobbyist is,' the Illinois  senator told the newspaper in an interview.      'If we could eliminate loopholes in taxes, create a  level playing field, then I think there's the possibility to  reducing corporate rates.'      Obama did not offer specifics and said his economic team  was taking a look at the issue.      He has criticized a proposal for broader corporate tax cuts  favored by Republican John McCain, saying they would widen the  budget deficit without boosting overall economic growth.      'I've seen no evidence that ... would actually boost the  economic growth and productivity,' Obama said.      McCain, an Arizona senator who will face Obama in  November's presidential election, has pledged to cut corporate  tax rates to 25 percent from 35 percent. He would also keep in  place all of President George W. Bush's tax cuts for the  country's wealthier individuals.      Obama also suggested the possibility of giving start-up  companies a break from capital gains taxes.      He would allow the Bush tax cuts to expire for the  wealthiest Americans and has said he would consider boosting  the rate on capital gains and dividend taxes.      Obama's Republican critics contend that allowing rates on  individuals in the highest income brackets to rise would harm  small business owners.      Obama said in the Wall Street Journal interview that any  tax breaks for start-ups would need to come with clear  guidelines to prevent abuse.      'There are always folks who are interested in gaming the  system, and obviously one of the things you have to do with tax  policy generally is to pin down definitions so they're not  twisted beyond recognition,' he said.      'Companies that are starting off ... should be allowed to  accumulate capital, reinvest profits, if there are any, to the  point that they stabilize.'

      "Text": "    * McCain would keep Bush's tax cuts      * Obama sees tax relief for middle class      * McCain asks 'What kind of change?'      * Obama doubts McCain can pay for tax cuts           By Jeff Mason      WASHINGTON, June 10 (Reuters) - Republican John McCain and  Democrat Barack Obama staked out starkly opposing stances on  taxes on Tuesday, with McCain promising corporate tax breaks  and Obama pledging tax increases for many.      McCain in a speech in Washington accused Obama of seeking  the single largest tax increase since World War Two while  Obama, in a television interview, said he would increase taxes  on the wealthy and on stock profits to pay for a middle-class  tax cut of $1,000 a year.      'No matter which of us wins in November, there will be  change in Washington. The question is what kind of change?'  McCain told a conference for small businesses.      Obama told CNBC that he would raise taxes on Americans  making $250,000 a year or more and raise the capital gains tax  for those in higher income brackets while exempting small  investors. He said the U.S. economy has been 'out of balance  for too long.'      'So the general principle of raising taxes on higher income  Americans, like myself, and providing relief to those who  haven't benefited as much from this new global economy, I  think, is a sound one,' Obama said.      But Obama, 46, said the tax increases he seeks would be  dependent on the economic situation he inherits from President  George W. Bush should he win the November election.      'Some of those you could possibly defer,' he said. 'But I  think the basic principle of restoring fairness to our economy  and encouraging bottom up economic growth is important.'      The differences on how to spur new growth in the sluggish  U.S. economy, at a time of rising unemployment, record-high  gasoline prices and a persistent housing crisis, represented a  key point of argument for the two candidates in their battle to  determine who wins the presidency.      Obama and other Democrats believe economic conditions,  including $4-a-gallon gasoline, will persuade many Americans to  vote for them in November. McCain wants to fight the election  on national security, which he considers his strength.           WOULD KEEP BUSH TAX CUTS      McCain, 71, vowed to maintain Bush's tax cuts, lower  corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 25 percent and allow  companies to expense new equipment and technology in their  first year.      He supported keeping capital gains taxes as they are now,  doubling a tax exemption for children, and phasing out the  'alternative minimum tax' which he said would save some 25  million middle-class families up to $2,000 in a year.      He said he could pay for the plan by cutting what he called  wasteful government spending. Democrats argue not enough cuts  could be made in the federal budget to pay for McCain's tax  cuts.     'He hasn't come remotely close to figuring out how to pay  for it,' Obama told reporters in St. Louis, where he traveled  to talk up his proposals on revamping the U.S. health care  system.      McCain was equally dismissive of Obama's economic plan.      'Under Senator Obama's tax plan, Americans of every  background would see their taxes rise -- seniors, parents,  small business owners and just about everyone who has even a  modest investment in the market,' McCain said.      Anti-Iraq war protesters interrupted McCain's speech a  handful of times, standing up and saying w",

Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama ripped  Republican rival John McCain on Monday for joking during a  televised discussion on values that $5 million fit the  definition for being monetarily rich.      'I guess if you're making $3 million a year, you're middle  class,' Obama told a campaign event in New Mexico.      'That's reflected in ... his policies,' Obama said, adding  McCain would give a $500,000 tax credit to people making more  than $2.5 million.      McCain, who made the comment to evangelical pastor Rick  Warren on Saturday, caught himself immediately and said the  remark would likely be taken out of context.      The ailing U.S. economy and soaring energy prices have  become the top issue in the race for the White House.

      "Text": "    By Joan Gralla      NEW YORK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. states, already battered  by the financial crisis, risk suffering a further hit to their  coffers when individuals file their income tax returns in  April.      Falling income tax receipts from wealthy individuals could  further gouge their already battered budgets, according to  state officials and financial analysts.      Raising income taxes, as California did just last week, may  fail to raise more tax dollars as the incomes of some wealthy  people are falling too precipitously.      Yet most U.S. states by law must balance their budgets. The  risk that their credit ratings will be cut if they borrow or  sell assets, from hospitals to water systems, to close deficits  may force states into difficult spending cuts.      Congress hoped to stave off job-killing spending cuts by  the states by including $150 billion in its new economic  stimulus plan for them. But states face a total of $311 billion  of deficits in the next two years and can only use about $8  billion of the new federal aid to fill in budget holes.      Rich individuals who pay state income taxes cut their  estimated payments in January, which means their final bills  due in April likely will be smaller than expected. These  taxpayers, typically the self-employed, who are paid bonuses or  reap capital gains, may even be owed refunds.      California, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey,  Massachusetts, Virginia, and Maryland, which all rely heavily  on income taxes paid by well-to-do residents, saw these tax  revenues plunge 15 percent to 30 percent. The main culprit was   the fall in the stock market, officials said.      The federal government faces the same problem. The top 5  percent of U.S. taxpayers paid nearly 44 percent of all income  taxes in 2005, according to the Congressional Budget Office.      The drop in Maryland's revenues is particularly troubling  because it increased millionaires' income tax rates in 2008,  noted David Roose, director of Maryland's Bureau of Revenue  Estimates. The levy rose to 6.25 percent from 4.75 percent.      Democratic President Barack Obama deficit-cutting plan  includes letting Republican President George W. Bush's tax cuts  expire in 2011, which will push the top rate above 39 percent.  But by then the economy could have rebounded. In contrast, some  states, including New York, might raise millionaires taxes  now.      Advocates of such a move note that on an historical basis  the highest U.S. tax rate at 35 percent is just about one-third  of the 94 percent rate paid by wealthy individuals in the last  two years of World War Two.      Foes of wringing more income tax dollars out of wealthy  people say this will prolong the recession.      For example, Kenneth Adams, chairman of The Business  Council, says New York should cut spending more deeply instead  of adding two percentage points to push the top rate to 10.3  percent, as some Democratic lawmakers proposed.      'The massive increase in the personal income tax...would  devastate New York's economy and undermine our chances for  recovery from this deep recession,' he said.      Joel Slemrod, a University of Michigan economics professor,  said state tax increases or budget reductions could thwart the  national economic stimulus plan.      'I think either way, cutting spending or raising taxes, is  the opposite of what we want to stimulate the economy.'        A recent JPMorgan Chase report demonstrated just how much ",

The Arizona senator who has wrapped up his party's  presidential nomination, also said he would propose a simpler,  alternative tax system and insist that chief executives' pay  and severance packages have shareholder approval.      'No matter which of us wins in November, there will be  change in Washington. The question is what kind of change?'  McCain will tell a conference for small businesses, referring  to his Democratic opponent, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois.      'Will we enact the single largest tax increase since the  Second World War as my opponent proposes, or will we keep taxes  low for families and employers?' he will say, according to  excerpts released before his speech.      McCain will pledge to act quickly to lower corporate taxes  from 'the second highest in the world to one on par with our  trading partners to keep businesses and jobs in this country.'      He will also propose a law to allow companies to expense  new equipment and technology in their first year.      He supports keeping capital gains taxes low, doubling a tax  exemption for children, and phasing out the 'alternative  minimum tax' which he said would save some 25 million  middle-class families up to $2,000 in a year.      McCain criticized Obama for wanting to increase dividend  and capital gains taxes and aiming to raise the minimum wage  and link it to an index.      But the Republican also takes aim at top corporate  executives with big salaries and excessive severance packages.      'Under my reforms, all aspects of a CEO's pay, including  any severance arrangements, must be approved by shareholders,'  he will say.

      "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Most U.S. and foreign  corporations doing business in the United States avoid paying  any federal income taxes, despite trillions of dollars worth of  sales, a government study released on Tuesday said.      The Government Accountability Office said 72 percent of all  foreign corporations and about 57 percent of U.S. companies  doing business in the United States paid no federal income  taxes for at least one year between 1998 and 2005.      More than half of foreign companies and about 42 percent of  U.S. companies paid no U.S. income taxes for two or more years  in that period, the report said.      During that time corporate sales in the United States  totaled $2.5 trillion, according to Democratic Sens. Carl Levin  of Michigan and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, who requested the  GAO study.      The report did not name any companies. The GAO said  corporations escaped paying federal income taxes for a variety  of reasons including operating losses, tax credits and an  ability to use transactions within the company to shift income  to low tax countries.      With the U.S. budget deficit this year running close to the  record $413 billion that was set in 2004 and projected to hit a  record $486 billion next year, lawmakers are looking to plug  holes in the U.S. tax code and generate more revenues.      Dorgan in a statement called the report 'a shocking  indictment of the current tax system.' Levin said it made clear  that 'too many corporations are using tax trickery to send  their profits overseas and avoid paying their fair share in the  United States.'      The study showed about 28 percent of large foreign  corporations, those with more than $250 million in assets,  doing business in the United States paid no federal income  taxes in 2005 despite $372 billion in gross receipts, the  senators said. About 25 percent of the largest U.S. companies  paid no federal income taxes in 2005 despite $1.1 trillion in  gross sales that year, they said.

However, Austan Goolsbee, a key economic official in the  Illinois senator's inner circle, told Reuters that he believed  Obama does want oil and gas companies and private equity firms  to pay higher taxes.      'As an overall matter do corporate rates need to go up?  No,' Goolsbee said in an interview on Thursday.      'There are many corporations for whom he does think they  need to go up,' Goolsbee added. 'When he says we need to close  all the loopholes for the oil and gas industry, he is saying  their corporate taxes need to go up. They're not paying their  fair share.'      As Obama takes a commanding lead over New York Sen. Hillary  Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination, investors  are hungry for a clearer picture of how the first-term senator  would alter U.S. financial policies if he wins the White  House.      Goolsbee, an economics professor at the University of  Chicago Graduate School of Business, sketched out Obama's  positions and sought to assuage concerns on Wall Street that he  would be less open to global trade than President George W.  Bush.      'I don't think he views himself as a protectionist,'  Goolsbee said. He said Obama favored expanding access to global  markets through trade deals such as the World Trade  Organization's Doha round so long as labor and environmental  standards were in place.      Obama has won labor support for his criticisms of the North  American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, which he says he wants to  amend.      Goolsbee criticized the Bush administration for not  enforcing existing trade agreements and bringing too few cases  before for the WTO. Such cases would likely rise significantly  in an Obama administration, he indicated. China, he said, was  one example where a host of violations had been overlooked.      The senator is also 'very concerned' about the country's  current account deficit with China and other nations.      'We have major imbalances with many parts of the world,' he  said. 'This is naturally what happens when you're running huge  deficits and the country doesn't have a lot of savings. You  have to borrow the money from abroad. He's very concerned about  that.'           THE FED, ECONOMY AND TAXES      Obama's plan to address the situation is based largely on  getting people to save. He has proposed an automatic saving  mechanism so that workers put money into a retirement account  on a regular basis, unless they opt out.      Both Obama and Clinton have emphasized their economic  proposal as voters worry about a potential recession.      But Goolsbee declined to comment on the performance of one  of the economy's key stewards, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and  its chairman, Ben Bernanke.      'The Fed's independent for good reason and it's not the  place of presidential candidates or the president to...evaluate  how they think the head of the Fed is doing,' Goolsbee said.       He expressed sympathy for the central bank's job -- and  personal praise for its leader. 'It's a tough position for it  to be in the middle of all this credit turmoil,' he said.  'Bernanke himself is a good guy. I know him as an academic.  He's a very nice guy.'      On taxes, Goolsbee said ",

      "Text": "  (Adds quotes, background)      By Jeff Mason      WASHINGTON, June 10 (Reuters) - Republican White House  candidate John McCain will promise on Tuesday to lower  corporate tax rates if he wins the U.S. presidency and ease the  tax burden on middle-class workers to help revive the faltering  economy.      The Arizona senator, who has wrapped up his party's  presidential nomination, also would propose a simpler,  alternative tax system and insist that chief executives' pay  and severance packages have shareholder approval.      'No matter which of us wins in November, there will be  change in Washington. The question is what kind of change?'  McCain will tell a conference for small businesses, referring  to his Democratic opponent, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois.      'Will we enact the single largest tax increase since the  Second World War as my opponent proposes, or will we keep taxes  low for families and employers?' he will say, according to  excerpts released before his speech.      McCain will pledge to act quickly to lower corporate taxes  from 'the second highest in the world to one on par with our  trading partners to keep businesses and jobs in this country.'      He will propose a law to allow companies to expense new  equipment and technology in their first year.      He supports keeping capital gains taxes low, doubling a tax  exemption for children, and phasing out the 'alternative  minimum tax' which he said would save some 25 million  middle-class families up to $2,000 in a year.      On Monday Obama drew a sharp contrast with McCain, his  opponent in the November election, accusing him of wanting to  widen President George W. Bush's tax cuts and plunge the United  States deeper into debt.      He charged that McCain's support for extending Bush's tax  cuts would allow $2 trillion in corporate tax breaks.      U.S. taxes were too complicated overhaul, McCain will say  in his speech, in which he will argue for an alternative  system.      'As president, I will propose an alternative tax system.   When this reform is enacted, all who wish to file under the  current system could still do so,' he will say.      'Everyone else could choose a vastly less complicated  system with two tax rates and a generous standard deduction.'      McCain criticizes Obama for wanting to increase dividend  and capital gains taxes and aiming to raise the minimum wage  and link it to an index.      But he also takes aim at top corporate executives with big  salaries and excessive severance packages.      'Americans are right to be offended when the extravagant  salaries and severance deals of CEOs ... bear no relation to  the success of the company or the wishes of shareholders,' he  will say, adding that some of those chief executives helped  bring on the country's housing crisis and market troubles.      'If I am elected president, I intend to see that wrongdoing  of this kind is called to account by federal prosecutors. And  under my reforms, all aspects of a CEO's pay, including any  severance arrangements, must be approved by shareholders,' he  will say.

That would raise $1 billion and enable the city to avoid  raising sales taxes, said the speech by Speaker Christine  Quinn.

If Mayor Michael Bloomberg approved the new rates, incomes  of $297,000 to $532,000 would be taxed at 4.25 percent, up from  3.683 percent. Taxpayers who earn $532,000 to $1.2 million  would pay 4.45 percent; above $1.2 million the rate would rise  to 4.65 percent.

      "Text": "    By Caren Bohan and Lisa Lambert      WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama  sought on Monday to bolster political support for the $787  billion economic package, telling the nation's governors that  the money would go out quickly and be spent wisely.      The package of public works funds, tax cuts and aid to  states that Obama signed into law last week highlighted  partisan division in Washington after it passed the U.S.  Congress with only three Republican votes.      Many congressional Republicans derided the stimulus as  wasteful. But while some Republican governors said they would  refuse some of the money others welcomed it as needed help for  their fiscal woes.      Meeting with the governors of both parties at the White  House, Obama told them that a $15 billion portion of the  stimulus slated to help states pay for the Medicaid health  program for the poor would be going out on Wednesday.      'I know something that is going to be of great relief to  many of you,' Obama said.      'This is not a blank check,' he added. 'We're going to work  with you closely to make sure that this money is spent the way  it's supposed to.'      Obama pushed the economic stimulus plan through the  Democratic-led Congress, arguing that it was needed to prevent  the recession from turning into an economic catastrophe.      The passage of the massive bill -- the largest fiscal  stimulus in U.S. history -- marked a huge victory for Obama.      But he has been forced to defend the measure as Republicans  in Congress characterized it as larded with wasteful spending  and warned that it would only bloat the budget deficit.      To underline his promise that there would be strict  oversight of the stimulus package, Obama announced he was  putting Vice President Joe Biden in charge of supervising the  bill's implementation.      Biden will help ensure there are no bottlenecks in getting  the money out and that it would be spent on projects that would  help the economy recover.      Obama also named Earl Devaney, a former Secret Service  special agent and a longtime government investigator, to serve  as the top watchdog overseeing the funds.      Devaney has served for a decade as the inspector general at  the Department of Interior, where he led investigations into a  series of scandals at the agency.

      "Text": "    By Caren Bohan      WASHINGTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama  on Friday vowed strict oversight of his $787 billion stimulus  plan, pushing back against Republicans who have labeled the  centerpiece of his economic agenda fiscally irresponsible.      Obama said he would name a team of managers to ensure that  billions of dollars slated to go toward infrastructure projects  would be spent wisely.      'The American people are watching. They need this plan to  work,' Obama said at a gathering at the White House with dozens  of the nation's mayors.      'And they expect to see the money they worked so hard to  earn spent in its intended purpose without waste, inefficiency, or  fraud.'      After taking office last month amid a deepening recession,  Obama put as his top priority passage of the stimulus plan. He has  said the measure was needed to jump-start growth and prevent the  unemployment rate from surging into the double digits.      The signing this week of the bill -- one of the most expensive  in history -- marked a big victory for Obama and his Democratic  allies in Congress.      But Republicans, most of whom refused to support the  stimulus plans, criticized the bill as laden with wasteful  spending that they said would do little to revive the economy.      Obama has rejected that characterization. In addition to  the infrastructure spending, the bill includes tax cuts and  spending to bolster social safety net programs like unemployment  insurance.      At the event with the mayors, Obama said the stimulus plan  would not only create jobs, it would also put the economy on a  sounder footing in the long term through spending on critical  infrastructure such as roads and bridges, mass transit and the  expansion of broadband networks.      He also emphasized his intent to prevent any wasteful uses  of the money.      'If a federal agency proposes a project that will waste  that money, I will not hesitate to call them out on it, and put  a stop to it,' Obama said.      'I want everyone here to be on notice that if a local  government does the same, I will call them out on it as well, and  use the full power of my office and our administration to stop  it,' he added.      After calling for economic help from the federal government  for more than a year, mayors from both political parties are among  the strongest supporters of Obama's fiscal stimulus package.      Obama's pledge to spend the stimulus money efficiently  comes ahead of events planned next week in which he and his  aides will emphasize their commitment to rein in the budget  deficit, which private economists say will likely balloon to  around $1.5 trillion this year.      On Monday, he is hosting lawmakers, economists and  representatives of business and labor groups at the White House  for a 'Fiscal Responsibility Summit.'      At the fiscal summit, which will be attended by top  Democrats as well as leading Republicans, Obama is expected to  underscore his commitment to tackle long-term budget  challenges, such as the cost of health and retirement  entitlement programs.      The White House is expected to unveil its budget proposal on  Thursday.      'The president felt that we have to start doing this now. For  too long, there has been an irresponsibility among people in the  Beltway who were unwilling to make the tough choices,' said  Kenneth Baer, a spokesman for the White House budget office.      'This will be the beginning of that process,' ",

      "Text": " (Adds comment from Trenton mayor, more details)      By Caren Bohan and Lisa Lambert      WASHINGTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama  vowed strict oversight on Friday of his $787 billion stimulus  plan, pushing back against Republicans who have labeled the  centerpiece of his economic agenda fiscally irresponsible.      Obama said he would name a team of managers to ensure that  billions of dollars slated for infrastructure projects would be  spent wisely.      'The American people are watching. They need this plan to  work,' Obama said at a gathering at the White House with dozens  of the nation's mayors.      'And they expect to see the money they worked so hard to  earn spent in its intended purpose without waste, inefficiency,  or fraud.'      After taking office last month amid a deepening recession,  Obama made his top priority the passage of the stimulus plan.  He said the measure was crucial to jump-start growth and  prevent the unemployment rate from surging into double digits.      The signing this week of the bill -- the most expensive in  history -- marked a big victory for Obama and his Democratic  allies in Congress.      But Republicans, most of whom refused to support the  stimulus plan, criticized the bill as laden with wasteful  spending and said it would do little to revive the economy.      Obama and other Democrats have bristled at Republican  attempts to characterize their plans as fiscally irresponsible.  They note the federal budget shifted from surplus to huge  deficits during Republican President George W. Bush's  administration.      Republicans controlled Congress during much of the Bush  administration.      In addition to the infrastructure spending, the bill  includes tax cuts and spending to bolster social safety net  programs like unemployment insurance.      At the event with the mayors, Obama said the stimulus plan  would not only create jobs but put the economy on a sounder  footing in the long term through spending on infrastructure  such as roads and bridges, mass transit and the expansion of  broadband networks.           TARGETING WASTE      He also emphasized his intent to prevent any wasteful uses  of the money.      'If a federal agency proposes a project that will waste  that money, I will not hesitate to call them out on it, and put  a stop to it,' Obama said.      'I want everyone here to be on notice that if a local  government does the same, I will call them out on it as well,  and use the full power of my office and our administration to  stop it,' he added.      After asking for economic help from the federal government  for more than a year, mayors of both political parties are  among the strongest supporters of Obama's stimulus package.      Several mayors who attended the event told reporters later  they supported Obama's call for accountability, not only for  the federal government but for cities as well.      'We don't mind getting called out. ... We welcome that kind  of accountability. We're going to help get the job done,' said   Trenton, New Jersey, Mayor Douglas Palmer.      Obama's pledge to spend the stimulus money efficiently came  before events planned next week in which he and his aides will  emphasize their commitment to rein in the budget deficit, which  private economists say will likely balloon to about $1.5  trillion this year. That figure includes the $700 billion from  the bank rescue plan but not the stimulus plan signed by  Obama.      The deficit",

      "Text": "    * Clinton does not concede      * Obama wins Montana, Clinton takes South Dakota      * McCain, Obama start November election campaign           By John Whitesides, Political Correspondent      WASHINGTON, June 3 (Reuters) - Barack Obama captured the  Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday, capping a rapid  rise from political obscurity to become the first black to lead  a major U.S. party into a race for the White House.      Rival Hillary Clinton, a former first lady who entered the  race 17 months ago as a heavy favorite, briefly congratulated  Obama but did not concede. The New York senator said she would  consult with party leaders and supporters to determine her next  move.      A surge of support from uncommitted delegates helped give  Obama the 2,118 votes he needed to clinch the nomination as the  lengthy Democratic battle concluded with an Obama victory in  Montana and a Clinton win in South Dakota.      Obama will be crowned the Democratic nominee at the  convention in August and will face Republican John McCain in  November's election to choose a successor to President George  W. Bush.      'Tonight, we mark the end of one historic journey with the  beginning of another,' Obama told a victory celebration in St.  Paul, Minnesota, at the site of the Republican convention in  September.      'Tonight, I can stand before you and say that I will be the  Democratic nominee for President of the United States,' he told  17,000 cheering supporters. Another 15,000 supporters gathered  outside the arena.      The win by Obama, son of a black Kenyan father and white  mother from Kansas, marked a milestone in U.S. history. It came  45 years after the height of the civil rights movement led by  Martin Luther King, who was assassinated in 1968.      It followed one of the closest and longest nomination  fights in recent U.S. political history. Clinton, who would  have been the first woman nominee in U.S. political history,  won more than 1,900 delegates.      She told New York members of Congress she would be open to  becoming Obama's vice presidential running mate, and her  backers turned up the pressure on Obama to pick her as his No.  2.      She told a cheering crowd of supporters in New York City  that she would work for party unity but made no public  overtures to Obama.      'This has been a long campaign and I will make no decisions  tonight,' she said. 'In the coming days I'll be consulting with  supporters and party leaders to determine how to move forward  with the best interests of our party and my country guiding my  way.'      Obama lavished praise on Clinton after beating her.      'Senator Hillary Clinton has made history in this campaign  not just because she's a woman who has done what no woman has  done before, but because she's a leader who inspires millions  of Americans,' he said.      'Our party and our country are better off because of her,  and I am a better candidate for having had the honor to compete  with Hillary Rodham Clinton,' he said.      An Obama aide said he called Clinton after their speeches,  congratulated her on her South Dakota victory and asked her to  call him back.           MCCAIN KICKS OFF RACE      McCain kicked off his race against Obama with a rally in  Louisiana where he sought to distance himself from Bush and  questioned Obama's judgment. He called Obama a 'formidable'  opponent but one who had not shown a willingness to put aside  partisan interests.      'He is an impressive ",

      "Text": " (Updates with meeting begins)      By Caren Bohan and Thomas Ferraro      WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama urged  skeptical Republicans to back his $825 billion economic  stimulus package on Tuesday during a visit to the U.S. Congress  on Capitol Hill.      Shortly before Obama arrived, House Minority Leader John  Boehner told fellow Republicans that in its current form, he  could not vote for the stimulus and encouraged fellow House  Republicans to vote against it, a Boehner spokesman said.      Obama conferred first with Republican members of the House  of Representatives and then was to go to the other side of the  Capitol to talk to Senate Republicans.      Republicans agree that the stumbling economy needs a rescue  package. But they complain the Democratic $550 billion spending  proposal is excessive while their proposal to cut taxes by  about $275 billion does not go far enough.      'We're anxious to help him. We think the country needs a  stimulus,' Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said  earlier on Tuesday on NBC's 'Today Show.'      A week after taking office, Obama faces an economic crisis  that seems to worsen by the day. U.S. consumer confidence  slipped to a record low and major U.S. companies are cutting  tends of thousands of jobs as financial industry troubles  continue to mount.  [ID:nT114397]      Obama's meeting with the Republican lawmakers comes the day  after Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner won Senate  confirmation and was sworn in.  [ID:nN26616671]      The Democratic-led House and Senate are expected to approve  the package by the middle of next month regardless of how many  Republicans embrace it.      McConnell said he believes Congress can hit the Democrats'  deadline of passing a rescue measure by mid-February. He said  Obama may have more difficulty with Democrats than Republicans  in getting a balanced package.      With the House set to vote on its version of the plan this  week, a co-chair of the coalition of fiscally conservative  Democrats said his 50-member group had concerns.  [ID:nN27437028]      Representative Charlie Melancon of Louisiana said his  colleagues want Obama to promise that the record federal  deficit is not further bloated by tax cuts or by increases in  mandatory government spending programs, like the Social  Security retirement program and Medicare health care program  for the elderly.      'The majority of us want to support the president and do a  stimulus package,' Melancon said. 'But we also have come to the  realization that every day that we don't get a commitment to  reel in this spending that we've been doing without paying for  it is a day ... that the problem gets worse.'           'WANTS TO HEAR THEIR IDEAS'      White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama wants to  listen to Republicans as part of his vow to seek consensus and  end traditional partisan gridlock.      'He wants to hear their ideas. If there are good ideas --  and I think he assumes there will be -- that we will look at  those ideas,' Gibbs told reporters on Monday.      Obama's aides have said three-quarters of the proposed new  spending, on health care, education and building new roads and  bridges, would work its way into the economy within 18 months.      A report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  said it would take a bit longer. CBO estimated that about 64  percent of the stimulus package would be reach the economy  within 19 months.

      "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - An $825 billion stimulus  bill aimed at reviving the U.S. economy presents an early test  of President Barack Obama's vow to overcome partisan politics  and forge consensus.      Following are scenarios on the political risks Obama and  his fellow Democrats in Congress as well as Republican  lawmakers face as they address the president's proposed package  of new federal spending and tax cuts.           RISKS FOR OBAMA AND DEMOCRATIC-LED CONGRESS      With Democrats in control of both Congress and the White  House for the first time since 1995, the stimulus package will  be their initial major test.      If the package proves effective, eases a deepening  recession and creates or saves millions of jobs, the new  president will be crowned a political hero. The same goes for  those who helped him turn the legislation into law.      If the package fails to jump-start the economy, a now  adoring public may turn against Obama and he could face a tough  time winning a second term in 2012.      Democrats in Congress could pay a price even sooner. The  entire House of Representatives and a third of the 100-member  Senate will be up for grabs in 2010. Unless the economy  improves markedly, expect Republicans to gain seats in both  chambers.           RISKS FOR OBAMA      Obama's main objective is to have the stimulus package  passed by Congress, a task helped by Democratic majorities in  both houses of Congress.      He also needs a bipartisan consensus of Republicans and  Democrats to pass it to bolster his image as a bridge builder.      Consensus will show voters that a campaign promise to end  overly partisan politics is being fulfilled.      If not, it will be seen as evidence that partisan divisions  defy Obama's ability to produce change, even during his  so-called honeymoon period.      In his inaugural address, he said, 'The old stale political  arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply.'      Commentators are watching for attempts by Republicans to  block the legislation through a filibuster in the Senate. Any  sustained attempt to do so would be read as defiance.      Obama also risks angering Democratic allies if they  perceive he works harder to satisfy Republican demands for a  bigger component of tax cuts in the bill than Democratic  objections.           RISKS FOR REPUBLICANS      Republican House Minority Leader John Boehner accused  Democrats on Thursday of wanting to push the stimulus bill  through without bothering to find common ground with  Republicans.      Some Republicans also fear the bill, which Democratic  leaders want passed by mid-February, is too big and is being  pushed through too fast.      But Republicans want to avoid been seen as obstructing a  bill that could revive the economy in a severe recession.      Their vote against former President George W. Bush's $700  billion bank bailout in October sent the stock market reeling  and hurt the presidential bid of Republican John McCain.      Republicans also want to push for tax cuts and resist  wanton government spending -- issues seen as core principles  for their party.      If they are perceived as being overly cooperative with  Democrats on those issues, they risk angering fiscally  conservative supporters.           RISKS FOR DEMOCRATS      Democratic lawmakers must peacefully resolve differences  within the economic package -- or risk riling members of their  own party, particularly those pushing for more ",

      "Text": "    By Caren Bohan and Jeremy Pelofsky      WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President-elect Barack Obama,  said on Friday that the latest grim unemployment report added  urgency to the need to pass his $800 billion stimulus proposal,  even as his efforts ran into difficulties in the U.S.  Congress.      Obama's top aides visited Capitol Hill to allay lawmakers'  concerns about his proposal, which would combine tax cuts, aid  to states and public works projects. The measure is aimed at  lifting the economy out of a recession that has already lasted  a year.      'Our expectation is that we will continue to hone and  refine our package over the next several weeks,' Obama told a  news conference, noting that the effort to craft the stimulus  package would be a collaboration with Congress.      Several Senate Democrats have raised questions about  whether some of the tax cuts for individuals and businesses  would have the desired impact and have called for more energy  tax breaks.      New York Sen. Charles Schumer played down those  differences, saying there was an awareness that time was of the  essence in passing the bill.      'While it's certainly true that we in Congress will have  input, and we certainly provided some suggestions and comments  in that meeting yesterday, the urgency of this economic crisis  is going to limit any haggling over competing approaches,'  Schumer said.      The Labor Department reported earlier on Friday that U.S.  employers slashed more than half a million jobs from their  payrolls in December, pushing the unemployment rate to 7.2  percent from 6.8 percent in November.      It was the highest jobless rate in nearly 16 years and the  report said the ailing economy hemorrhaged 2.6 million jobs for  all of 2008, the most since 1945.           'STARK REMINDER'      Obama called the jobs report a 'stark reminder' that the  government needed to act. 'Clearly the situation is dire. It is  deteriorating and it demands urgent and immediate action,' he  said.      There is broad consensus among Democrats and Republicans  that bold steps are needed to address the economy's woes. Obama  is also benefiting from a reservoir of goodwill as he prepares  to take office on Jan. 20 with high public approval ratings.      Still, signs are emerging that his goal of securing package  of the measure by mid-February will prove challenging.      In addition to some of the questions about the structure of  the tax cuts, a report from the Congressional Budget Office has  added to nervousness about the impact of the stimulus on  already skyrocketing budget deficits.      The CBO this week forecast a $1.2 trillion deficit for this  year, even before factoring in the stimulus.      Clearly aware of the need to use the bully pulpit to press  for passage of the stimulus, Obama warned in a speech on  Thursday that the U.S. recession could linger for years in the  absence of aggressive steps to jump start growth.      After meeting with Larry Summers, the incoming director of  the White House National Economic Council, and other Obama  aides, congressional Democrats echoed Obama's descriptions of  the situation as one that required urgency.      House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the stimulus plan would  help stem the kinds of job losses seen in the Labor  Department's report.      'We have to act very soon. We cannot wait until March. That  will be too late,' said Pelosi, a California Democrat.      House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told repor",

Another $110 billion \u2014 or 13 percent \u2014 will be spent next year. Which means that by the time President Obama's term is halfway through, just 16 percent of the money will have been spent.\n\nI thought President Obama said this is supposed to be a quick \"jolt\" to the economy?\n\nThe president has also billed the stimulus as an investment in America's infrastructure. And if that were true, I'd be all for it. I mean, I-95 here on the East Coast isn't exactly the autobahn. Yet only 3 percent \u2014 just $30 billion \u2014 of this entire package is dedicated to road and highway spending.\n\nThen you have the promise about creating \"green jobs\" and clean energy.\n\nAgain, you want to seriously get wind and solar and nuclear power off the ground, I'm in. But this isn't serious. Only 2 percent of the money is earmarked for clean energy and only 1/7th of that will be spent over the next 2 years.\n\nThe CBO tells us that billions of dollars are going to buy new computers and replace government cars with new alternative fuel vehicles. In all, the money is going to 150 different federal programs \u2014 from Amtrak to the TSA \u2014 and it's not clear a single new job will be created.\n\nAmerica, let's call a spade a spade: This package isn't meant to stimulate the economy, it's meant to reshape it.\n\nIf President Obama, Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the progressives really believe that socialism is the best way out of this mess and the best way forward for America, then make the case. Let's debate it and allow the American people to decide.\n\nBut what they're doing now \u2014 using fear to promote long-term changes to the country \u2014 is exactly the kind of thing that has led to the biggest deficit of all: The deficit of trust we now have in our leaders.\n\nWhat do you think?

      "Text": " (Fixes typos, 6th and 16 paragraphs)      By Caren Bohan and Thomas Ferraro      WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama urged  skeptical Republicans to back his $825 billion economic  stimulus package on Tuesday during a visit to the U.S. Congress  on Capitol Hill.      Shortly before Obama arrived, House Minority Leader John  Boehner told fellow Republicans that in its current form, he  could not vote for the stimulus and encouraged fellow House  Republicans to vote against it, a Boehner spokesman said.      Obama conferred first with Republican members of the House  of Representatives and then was to go to the other side of the  Capitol to talk to Senate Republicans.      Republicans agree that the stumbling economy needs a rescue  package. But they complain the Democratic $550 billion spending  proposal is excessive while their proposal to cut taxes by  about $275 billion does not go far enough.      'We're anxious to help him. We think the country needs a  stimulus,' Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said  earlier on Tuesday on NBC's 'Today Show.'      A week after taking office, Obama faces an economic crisis  that seems to worsen by the day. U.S. consumer confidence  slipped to a record low and major U.S. companies are cutting  tens of thousands of jobs as financial industry troubles  continue to mount.  [ID:nT114397]      Obama's meeting with the Republican lawmakers comes the day  after Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner won Senate  confirmation and was sworn in.  [ID:nN26616671]      The Democratic-led House and Senate are expected to approve  the package by the middle of next month regardless of how many  Republicans embrace it.      McConnell said he believes Congress can hit the Democrats'  deadline of passing a rescue measure by mid-February. He said  Obama may have more difficulty with Democrats than Republicans  in getting a balanced package.      With the House set to vote on its version of the plan this  week, a co-chair of the coalition of fiscally conservative  Democrats said his 50-member group had concerns.  [ID:nN27437028]      Representative Charlie Melancon of Louisiana said his  colleagues want Obama to promise that the record federal  deficit is not further bloated by tax cuts or by increases in  mandatory government spending programs, like the Social  Security retirement program and Medicare health care program  for the elderly.      'The majority of us want to support the president and do a  stimulus package,' Melancon said. 'But we also have come to the  realization that every day that we don't get a commitment to  reel in this spending that we've been doing without paying for  it is a day ... that the problem gets worse.'           'WANTS TO HEAR THEIR IDEAS'      White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama wants to  listen to Republicans as part of his vow to seek consensus and  end traditional partisan gridlock.      'He wants to hear their ideas. If there are good ideas --  and I think he assumes there will be -- that we will look at  those ideas,' Gibbs told reporters on Monday.      Obama's aides have said three-quarters of the proposed new  spending, on health care, education and building new roads and  bridges, would work its way into the economy within 18 months.      A report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  said it would take a bit longer. CBO estimated that about 64  percent of the stimulus package would reach the economy within  19 months.

      "Text": "    By Caren Bohan      WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama  will visit Capitol Hill on Tuesday to try to build momentum for  an $825 billion package he says is urgently needed to keep the  U.S. economy from sinking into an even deeper recession.      A week after taking office, Obama is grappling with an  economic crisis that seems to worsen by the day. U.S. companies  such as the heavy-equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. are  announcing huge layoffs as troubles in the housing and  financial sectors mount.      But Obama's meeting with lawmakers comes after the  president achieved one victory on the economic front: the  confirmation of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.      With his economic team in place, Obama hopes he can win  passage of the stimulus plan by mid-February.      The Capitol Hill meeting is somewhat unusual. Obama's  predecessor, former President George W. Bush rarely visited  Congress, preferring to send aides and sometimes his vice  president, Dick Cheney.      White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama's meetings  with House of Representatives and Senate lawmakers would be  less negotiating sessions than a chance to gather input.      'He wants to hear their ideas. If there are good ideas --  and I think he assumes there will be -- that we will look at  those ideas,' Gibbs told reporters.      The House may begin debate on the stimulus bill on Tuesday,  though any votes would not take place until Wednesday.      While there is broad support in the Democratic-led U.S.  Congress for bold measures to jump-start the economy,  Republicans and some moderate Democrats are worried about the  measure's huge price tag at a time when U.S. budget deficits  are already projected to stretch into the trillions.           REPUBLICANS QUESTION CONTRACEPTIVE, TUITION SPENDING      Some $275 billion of the package would go toward tax cuts.  The other $550 billion would pay for public works projects,  alternative energy initiatives and the bolstering of  unemployment benefits and other safety-net programs.      Obama hopes to win bipartisan support for the plan, but  some Republicans disagree with Obama on how the tax cuts should  be structured and have questioned whether some spending  elements in the plan, including money for contraceptive  programs and college tuition assistance, would provide any kind  of short-term jolt to the economy.      Responding to criticism that the package contained too  little immediate help, Obama's aides have said three-quarters  of the spending would work its way into the economy within the  first 18 months.      According to a report issued late on Monday by the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, about 64 percent of  the stimulus package would be poured into the economy within 19  months.      Obama has sought to emphasize that he wants to listen to  Republican and Democratic ideas.      The Democratic tax cut plan would direct benefits more  toward lower-income workers, even those who do not pay income  taxes, while the House Republicans would help all taxpayers.      When some Republicans pressed Obama on Friday to change  that part of the plan, he replied that he won the election and  was sticking to the plan he had campaigned on.      Gibbs said the comment was meant to be light-hearted and  was not an attempt to pursue 'cowboy diplomacy' in the  negotiations.      In addition to the stimulus package, another issue that  could come up at the Capitol Hill meeting is",

      "Text": "    By Caren Bohan and Jeremy Pelofsky      WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President-elect Barack Obama  said on Friday that the latest grim unemployment report added  urgency to the need to pass his $800 billion stimulus proposal,  even as his efforts ran into difficulties in the U.S.  Congress.      Obama's top aides visited Capitol Hill to allay lawmakers'  concerns about his proposal, which would combine tax cuts, aid  to states and public works projects. The measure is aimed at  lifting the economy out of a recession that has already lasted  a year.      'Our expectation is that we will continue to hone and  refine our package over the next several weeks,' Obama told a  news conference, noting that the effort to craft the stimulus  package would be a collaboration with Congress.      Several Senate Democrats have raised questions about  whether some of the tax cuts for individuals and businesses  would have the desired impact and have called for more energy  tax breaks.      New York Sen. Charles Schumer played down those  differences, saying there was an awareness that time was of the  essence in passing the bill.      'While it's certainly true that we in Congress will have  input, and we certainly provided some suggestions and comments  in that meeting yesterday, the urgency of this economic crisis  is going to limit any haggling over competing approaches,'  Schumer said.      The Labor Department reported earlier on Friday that U.S.  employers slashed more than half a million jobs from their  payrolls in December, pushing the unemployment rate to 7.2  percent from 6.8 percent in November.      It was the highest jobless rate in nearly 16 years and the  report said the ailing economy hemorrhaged 2.6 million jobs for  all of 2008, the most since 1945.           'STARK REMINDER'      Obama called the jobs report a 'stark reminder' that the  government needed to act. 'Clearly the situation is dire. It is  deteriorating and it demands urgent and immediate action,' he  said.      There is broad consensus among Democrats and Republicans  that bold steps are needed to address the economy's woes. Obama  is also benefiting from a reservoir of goodwill as he prepares  to take office on Jan. 20 with high public approval ratings.      Still, signs are emerging that his goal of securing package  of the measure by mid-February will prove challenging.      In addition to some of the questions about the structure of  the tax cuts, a report from the Congressional Budget Office has  added to nervousness about the impact of the stimulus on  already skyrocketing budget deficits.      The CBO this week forecast a $1.2 trillion deficit for this  year, even before factoring in the stimulus.      Clearly aware of the need to use the bully pulpit to press  for passage of the stimulus, Obama warned in a speech on  Thursday that the U.S. recession could linger for years in the  absence of aggressive steps to jump start growth.      After meeting with Larry Summers, the incoming director of  the White House National Economic Council, and other Obama  aides, congressional Democrats echoed Obama's descriptions of  the situation as one that required urgency.      House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the stimulus plan would  help stem the kinds of job losses seen in the Labor  Department's report.      'We have to act very soon. We cannot wait until March. That  will be too late,' said Pelosi, a California Democrat.      House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told report",

      "Text": "    * Bad economic news adds sense of urgency      * Republicans want greater say, add tax cut proposals       (Updates after meeting)      By Ross Colvin and Matt Spetalnick      WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama  said on Friday he expected an $825 billion stimulus package for  the ailing U.S. economy to be approved by his target of  mid-February and personally urged congressional leaders to work  swiftly to pass it.      'We are experiencing an unprecedented economic crisis that  has to be dealt with and dealt with rapidly,' Obama told  reporters as he met with the lawmakers at the White House.      With new figures showing the U.S. economy sinking deeper  into recession, Obama is anxious to create bipartisan approach  to jolting the economy out of its worst crisis since the Great  Depression nearly 80 years ago.      Republicans, who have voiced concern over the shape of the  package and accuse Obama's majority Democrats of failing to  take their views into account, left the meeting saying they had  given Obama ideas of their own on new tax cuts.      Winning Republican support for the package will be an early  test of Obama's promise to forge consensus and overcome the  partisan politics that bitterly divided Washington under his  Republican predecessor George W. Bush.      'I recognize that there are still some difference around  the table and between the administration and members of  Congress about particular details on the plan,' Obama said.      But he added, 'It appears that we are on target to make our  Presidents Day weekend (goal for the stimulus plan).'      House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she too  believed Congress was on track to have a bill to be signed by  the president before the Presidents Day holiday on Feb. 16.  'Again, if not, there will be no recess,' Pelosi, a California  Democrat, told reporters after the meeting.           REPUBLICAN TAX PROPOSALS      Asked whether he was worried that Republicans would block  the stimulus package, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry  Reid said 'No.'      Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and House  Republican leader John Boehner also attended the meeting. They  said their proposals included tax cuts for workers and new tax  deductions for small businesses.      Republicans are upset at how the Obama administration plans  to spend the stimulus money, saying the $550 billion in  government spending would add too much to the deficit and that  the $275 billion earmarked for tax cuts is too little.      Obama says his plan aims to create or save 3 to 4 million  jobs in the U.S economy, which has been in a yearlong recession  since the collapse of the housing market sparked a global panic  over bank losses that in turn froze credit markets.      Wall Street was scrutinizing the outcome of the meeting   for signs that the stimulus package will be passed soon.      Worries over potential delays have helped push stocks  lower. Major U.S. indexes were down amid worries over corporate  profits and concerns that the global economic slowdown shows no  signs of ending.      The new president has said that rescuing the U.S. economy  is his No. 1 priority, and analysts say that, for now, his  first term was likely to be judged on his ability to restore  economic and financial stability.           DAILY ECONOMIC BRIEFING      In a change from Bush, Obama has added an economic   briefing to his daily schedule so that he can get the latest ",

      "Text": " (Incorporates OBAMA-ECONOMY/)      By Caren Bohan      WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama  will visit Congress on Tuesday to try to persuade reluctant  Republicans to support a $825 billion package he says is  essential to resuscitate a plunging economy.      A week after taking office, Obama faces an economic crisis  that seems to worsen by the day. Major U.S. companies cut tens  of thousands of jobs on Monday and housing and financial  industry troubles continue to mount.   [ID:nT114397]      Obama's meeting with the Republican lawmakers comes after  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner won Senate confirmation,  although 34 although Senators voted against him.   [ID:nN26616671]      With his economic team in place, Obama hopes he can win  passage of the stimulus plan by mid-February.      Although the Democratic president does not need broad  Republican support, the minority party could put up procedural  hurdles to slow the plan's progress.      White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama's meetings  with House of Representatives and Senate Republicans would be  less a negotiating session than a chance to gather input.      'He wants to hear their ideas. If there are good ideas, and  I think he assumes there will be, that we will look at those  ideas,' Gibbs told reporters.      The House and Senate are expected to approve the package by  the middle of next month regardless of how many Republicans  embrace it.      While there is strong support in the Democratic-led   Congress for bold measures to jump-start the economy,  Republicans differ with Obama on how the tax cuts should be  structured and have criticized his spending proposals at a time  of high budget deficits.      U.S. stocks opened higher on Tuesday, buoyed partly on  hopes for swift action by Geithner, the former head of the New  York Federal Reserve.  [ID:nLR704192]        REPUBLICAN QUESTIONS      Some $275 billion of the package would go toward tax cuts.  The other $550 billion would pay for public works projects,  alternative energy initiatives and would bolster unemployment  benefits and other safety-net programs.   [ID:nN27437028]      Republicans have seized on some spending items, including  money for contraceptive programs and college tuition assistance  which they say would not further create jobs in the near term.      Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, speaking on NBC's  Today show, agreed it was important to throw the economy a  lifeline but said Democrats had tilted the package toward  excessive spending.      'We're anxious to help him. We think the country needs a  stimulus,' said McConnell, a Kentucky Republican.      'Listening to what he wanted we think we may be closer to  that, oddly enough, than the Democratic majority, which seems  to be pulling in the direction of less tax relief and things  like fixing up the (National) Mall.'      Obama's aides have said three-quarters of the spending  would work its way into the economy within 18 months.      According to a report issued late on Monday by the  Congressional Budget Office, about 64 percent of the stimulus  package would be poured into the economy within 19 months.      The Democratic tax cut plan would direct benefits more  toward lower-income workers, even non-income tax payers, while  the House Republicans would help all taxpayers.      When some Republicans pressed Obama on Friday to change  that part of the plan, he replied that he won the election and  was sti",

      "Text": " (Refiling with updated headline)      Nov 5 (Reuters) - U.S. president-elect Barack Obama, hoping  to boost a struggling economy, has proposed a stimulus package  that some experts estimate could cost as much as $190 billion.      At the same time, the United States is facing record budget  deficits of at least $500 billion. Some analysts say the  deficit could go as high as $1 trillion next year.           Obama has said he would:      --Enact a windfall profits tax on oil companies to give  taxpayers an energy rebate.      --Give businesses a $3,000 refundable tax credit for each  new full-time employee hired in the United States over the next  two years.      --Allow small business to immediately write off up to  $250,000 in spending for new equipment and property through the  end of 2009. The stimulus package enacted earlier this year  provided for the $250,000 investment expensing limit only  through the end of this year.     --Eliminate capital gains taxes on investments in small  businesses.     --Make $25 billion immediately available for the  construction and repair of roads, bridges, schools and other  infrastructure.      --Provide $25 billion to states to help them cope with the  economic downturn without having to raise property taxes or cut  vital services.      --Make $50 billion in loan guarantees available and keep  other options open to help U.S. automobile manufacturers retool  and develop a new generation of fuel-efficient cars. Congress  has made $25 billion available.     --Implement a 90-day foreclosure moratorium for homeowners  making good faith efforts to pay their mortgage debt.     --Extend unemployment insurance for long-term jobless  workers who have exhausted their benefits, and temporarily  suspend taxes on those benefits.     --Temporarily allow penalty-free withdrawals of 15 percent  from tax-preferred retirement accounts up to $10,000.     --Suspend rules requiring retirees to begin withdrawing from  retirement accounts six months after they reach the age of 70.     --Increase home heating cost aid.     --Instruct the secretaries of the Treasury and Housing and  Urban Development to use their existing authority to more  aggressively modify the terms of mortgages.     --Reform the bankruptcy code to assist homeowners and remove  legal impediments to encouraging more mortgage restructuring.     --In the longer term, Obama would roll back some of Bush's  tax cuts for the wealthy. He proposed a permanent tax cut of  $500 for most individual workers and $1,000 for families. He  also would eliminate taxes for seniors making up to $50,000.      --To help jump-start the economy, the tax cuts would be  expedited through refunds based on 2007 tax returns. He would  also provide a 10 percent refundable tax credit for mortgage  interest to taxpayers who do not itemize their returns.     --On trade, Obama has promised to review the North American  Free Trade Agreement and use trade agreements to advance good  labor and environmental standards around the world. He has also  promised to end tax breaks that encourage companies to shift  U.S. jobs overseas.

      "Text": "    By Nick Carey      HOLLAND, Ohio, Oct 17 (Reuters) - After three days as a key  figure in the U.S. presidential campaign, Joe the Plumber would  like his old life back -- as soon as he finishes another round  of interviews.      'I'm just a plumber. I just want to get on with my life and  do my job,' Joe Wurzelbacher said in an interview on Friday  outside his modest home in middle America. 'I'd prefer to do  that without people camped out on my doorstep.'      Wurzelbacher's privacy became a victim of modern day  politics. Anxious to appear in touch with ordinary Americans  ahead of the Nov. 4 presidential election, Democrat Barack  Obama and Republican John McCain brought Wurzelbacher, 34, into  the glare of the presidential election campaign in their debate  Wednesday night and the plumber's life has been far from  ordinary ever since.      Early in the debate McCain cited Wurzelbacher as an example  of someone who would be hurt under Obama's tax plan. The  sparring candidates went on to refer to Joe the Plumber more  than two dozen times in the televised debate and within hours a  media circus had descended on a previously quiet street of  modest homes in the suburbs of Toledo.      Reporters quickly revealed that Wurzelbacher did not have a  plumbing license, had fallen behind on his taxes, had a real  first name of Sam, not Joe, along with other personal details  of Wurzelbacher's life.      It has left Joe the Plumber feeling drained.      'It's been tough to have the media all over this and coming  up with some things that aren't true,' he said. 'I have family  to think about, I have a 13-year-old son, it's hard to have  them see so many things about me that are negative.'           CONSERVATIVE MEDIA DARLING      To be sure, Wurzelbacher initially courted the attention.  It all started when Obama, campaigning door-to-door in  Wurzelbacher's neighborhood for the benefit of a trailing media  pack, met the plumber. Wurzelbacher asked a few pointed  questions about Obama's tax policy, complaining he could not  afford some of the provisions.      The confrontation made Wurzelbacher the darling of  conservative media for a day or two. Then came the debate.      The single father thinks all the attention is crazy.      'There are bigger issues to worry about than me,'  Wurzelbacher said. 'Whoever wins the election is going to have  to deal with things like people losing their jobs, health care  and immigration. This shouldn't be about me. It should be about  them.'      While the media have managed to dig up many personal  details of Wurzelbacher's life, he has kept at least one thing  secret: 'No one knows who I'm voting for,' he said, although he  has said he thought McCain did well in the debate.      McCain has apologized for subjecting Wurzelbacher to such  media scrutiny but he is in for a few more days of fame. While  camera crews remained stationed outside his home on Friday  morning, Wurzelbacher headed to New York for a couple more  media appearances.      His house remains a political tourist attraction for those  who see Wurzelbacher as one of them -- ordinary Americans often  overlooked by Washington.      Just after Wurzelbacher headed out, a couple of young guys  drove by in a red Chevrolet pickup truck. They slowed down to  yell encouragement.     'Good job, Joe,' they said. 'Way to go standing up for  America.'     (Reporting by Nick Carey; Writing by Andrea Hopkins; Editing  by Bill Trott)   ((andrea.hopkins@thom",

      "Text": "    By Andy Sullivan      WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Barack Obama and John McCain  may have turned him into the most famous small-business owner  in America, but Joe the Plumber isn't about to return the favor  with an endorsement.      The morning after he emerged as the unexpected star of  Wednesday night's presidential debate, Joe Wurzelbacher of  Holland, Ohio, declined to say who he will vote for in the Nov.  4 election.      'It's a personal decision, and myself and the button I push  will know the answer,' the 34-year-old plumber said on ABC's  'Good Morning America' program.      Wurzelbacher came to prominence last week when he asked  Obama about his tax plan during a campaign stop, which led to  an appearance on a Fox News talk show and an invitation to a  McCain rally.      Wurzelbacher said the sudden attention hasn't yet  translated into increased business.      'I hope I have a lot of jobs today. Yesterday I worked on a  water main break for a gas station and that's why I didn't give  any interviews. I was muddy and soaking wet,' he said.      Obama and McCain repeatedly invoked Wurzelbacher in their  final debate as they sought to appeal to average Americans.  McCain, a Republican, said Obama's plan to raise taxes on those  making more than $250,000 a year would hurt small-business  owners like Wurzelbacher.      Obama, a Democrat, said he would make it easier for  Wurzelbacher to provide health insurance for his employees.      Wurzelbacher told ABC he's 'not even close' to earning  $250,000, but worried that Obama would increase taxes for those  making less.      In a video interview with the Toledo Blade newspaper after  the debate, Wurzelbacher described himself as a man of modest  means.      'You see my house. I don't have a lot of bells and whistles  in here, really. My truck's a couple of years old and I'm going  to have it for the next 10 years, probably. So I don't see him  (Obama) helping me out.'      He said he wasn't swayed by Obama's health-care pitch,  either, describing it as 'just one more step toward  socialism.'      Wurzelbacher said he was pleased with McCain's performance.  'McCain came across with some solid points, and I was real  happy about that,' he said.

      "Text": "    By Jeff Mason      MIAMI, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee  John McCain said on Friday an Ohio man dubbed 'Joe the  Plumber,' who raised questions about Democrat Barack Obama's  tax plan, was being smeared by Democratic attacks.      McCain spent the day campaigning in Florida, trying to fend  off a strong challenge from Obama in a state the Republicans  have taken in the last two presidential elections but is up for  grabs on Nov. 4.      Obama was in Roanoke, Virginia, a traditionally Republican  state that is also tilting more Democratic this year. The  Illinois senator attacked McCain's health care plan.      Leading national opinion polls and surveys in key  battleground states, Obama picked up the endorsements of The  Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times.      The Post said both Obama and McCain are 'unusually talented  and qualified' candidates, but it questioned McCain's choice of  Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate  because she is 'not ready to be president.'      Speaking at a lively rally in Miami, McCain said Joe  Wurzelbacher, of Holland, Ohio, was being punished for asking  Obama a legitimate question.      'Last weekend, Sen. Obama showed up in Joe's driveway to  ask for his vote, and you know what Joe did? He asked Senator  Obama a tough question. I'm glad he did; I think Senator Obama  could use a few more tough questions,' McCain said.      'He wasn't recruited or prompted by our campaign. He just  asked a question. And Americans ought to be able to ask Senator  Obama tough questions without being smeared and targeted with  political attacks,' he said.      Democrats have been sharply critical of Wurzelbacher in the  days since 'Joe the Plumber' questioned Obama's plan to tax  Americans making more than $250,000 a year.           MCCAIN: 'HOLD ONTO YOUR WALLET'      The tax question prompted Obama to say he wanted to 'spread  the wealth around,' a comment that McCain and Republicans have  jumped on as a sign that the Democrat would pursue income  redistribution policies if elected.      Obama and McCain brought up Joe the Plumber more than two  dozen times at a debate on Wednesday night. Wurzelbacher's  brush with fame has come at a cost. The New York Times reported  that Wurzelbacher does not have a plumber's license and owes  back taxes.      The Arizona senator ridiculed Obama's remark about  spreading the wealth, saying, 'When politicians talk about  taking your money and spreading it around, you'd better hold  onto your wallet.'      Obama, trying to blunt McCain's appeal in retiree-haven  Florida, told about 8,000 supporters that McCain's health care  proposal to give Americans a $5,000 tax credit to help pay for  health insurance would require taxing health benefits, and  cutting the Medicare insurance program for seniors by $882  billion.      'If you count on Medicare, it would mean fewer places to  get care, and less freedom to choose your own doctors. You'll  pay more for your drugs, receive fewer services, and get lower  quality care. I don't think that's right,' Obama said.      McCain economic adviser Doug Holtz-Eakin charged that Obama  has 'consistently lied' about McCain's health care plan.      Holtz-Eakin said McCain's tax credit 'will not only shield  millions of families from a tax increase, but will actually  give them more dollars to invest in their health care needs.'      'The McCain plan does not tax medical expenses like the  cost of a pro",

      "Text": "    HOUSTON, June 3 (Reuters) - After more than a year of  training, a rocket ride to space and a two-day journey to reach  the International Space Station, the shuttle Discovery crew  floated into the orbital outpost with these words:      'Someone call a plumber?'      Someone had. With the $100 billion space station's sole  toilet on the blink, NASA made room aboard shuttle Discovery  for a new pump, which they hope will fix the problem.      'Yeah, we got it,' commander Mark Kelly assured station  flight engineer Garrett Reisman as the two greeted each other  in orbit on Monday.      The scene, captured was replayed on NASA TV early on  Tuesday.      The space station toilet, housed in the Russian-built  Zvezda module, is disposing of solid waste but the urine  collection system is not working properly. Every three flushes  or so it must be manually flushed with water, which takes two  crew members about 10 minutes.      While Discovery is docked at the space station, 210 miles  (338 km) above Earth, the three space station crew and the  seven visiting astronauts will have access to the shuttle's  toilet.      Repairs to the Russian-made space station commode fall to  station commander Sergei Volkov and flight engineer Oleg  Kononenko. The work is scheduled for Wednesday, NASA said.

      "Text": " (adds additional comments new graphs 4-5)      By Andy Sullivan      WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Barack Obama and John McCain  may have turned him into the most famous small-business owner  in America, but Joe the Plumber isn't about to return the favor  with an endorsement.      The morning after he emerged as the unexpected star of  Wednesday night's presidential debate, Joe Wurzelbacher of  Holland, Ohio, declined to say who he will vote for in the Nov.  4 election.      'It's a personal decision, and myself and the button I push  will know the answer,' the 34-year-old plumber and single  father said on ABC's 'Good Morning America' program.      Later outside his home he told a crowd of reporters 'I want  the American people to vote for who they want to vote for,' and  in an informed way.      He also said he was proud of what the U.S. military has  accomplished in Iraq, feels his views are shared by many middle  class working people he knows, is tired of people criticizing  the United States and feels that the U.S. Social Security  program is a 'joke.'      Wurzelbacher came to prominence last week when he asked  Obama about his tax plan during a campaign stop, which led to  an appearance on a Fox News talk show and an invitation to a  McCain rally.      Wurzelbacher said the sudden attention hasn't yet  translated into increased business.      'I hope I have a lot of jobs today. Yesterday I worked on a  water main break for a gas station and that's why I didn't give  any interviews. I was muddy and soaking wet,' he said.      Obama and McCain repeatedly invoked Wurzelbacher in their  final debate as they sought to appeal to average Americans.  McCain, a Republican, said Obama's plan to raise taxes on those  making more than $250,000 a year would hurt small-business  owners like Wurzelbacher.      Obama, a Democrat, said he would make it easier for  Wurzelbacher to provide health insurance for his employees.      Wurzelbacher told ABC he's 'not even close' to earning  $250,000, but worried that Obama would increase taxes for those  making less.      In a video interview with the Toledo Blade newspaper after  the debate, Wurzelbacher described himself as a man of modest  means.      'You see my house. I don't have a lot of bells and whistles  in here, really. My truck's a couple of years old and I'm going  to have it for the next 10 years, probably. So I don't see him  (Obama) helping me out.'      He said he wasn't swayed by Obama's health-care pitch,  either, describing it as 'just one more step toward  socialism.'      Wurzelbacher said he was pleased with McCain's performance.  'McCain came across with some solid points, and I was real  happy about that,' he said.

      "Text": "This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity & Colmes,\" October 17, 2008. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nSEAN HANNITY, CO-HOST: There you have it. With just 18 days away from election day, and the newest political star, Joe the plumber, is seeing the dirty side of politics. Joe, an Ohio plumber, became a household name after he questioned Barack Obama's tax plan. Now, since then he's been criticized about everything, from not having a plumber's license to owing money in back taxes, and today Senator McCain defended Joe at a rally in Florida.\n\nLet's take a listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R-AZ), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The response from Senator Obama and his campaign yesterday was to attack Joe \u2014 was to attack Joe. People are digging \u2014 people are digging through his personal life, and he has TV crews camped out in front of his house. He didn't ask Senator Obama to come to his house. He wasn't \u2014 he wasn't recruited or prompted by our campaign. He just asked a question.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Joining us now is the cofounder of Real Clear Politics, Tom Bevan, and radio talk show host Dennis Prager will be joining us in a minute, and also joining us, Obama supporter Michael Brown.\n\nAll right. Now before we get to anything here, it's \u2014 all he did was ask a question. Now he's had a full background check and smear and attack and besmirched, this poor guy.\n\nLet's watch as Biden and Obama mock him, and listen to the laughing in the crowd as we play this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. BARACK OBAMA (D-IL), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He's trying to suggest that a plumber is the guy he's fighting for. How many plumbers do you know making a quarter million dollars a year?\n\nSEN. JOE BIDEN (D-DE), VICE-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: John continues to cling to the notion, the fact that this guy, Joe the plumber. I don't know how many Joe the plumbers in my neighborhood that make $250,000 a year and are worried.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: I think to attack this man who asked a simple question, that if he starts a business, you know, and to mock him and let the crowd mock him and to let the media investigate him, you know, didn't pay back taxes, this is so fundamentally despicable.\n\nWhy can't you as a Democrat say you know what? Leave Joe, the plumber alone. He's out there swinging a wrench for 12 hours a day, probably six or seven days a week. Do you think it's unfair what's happening to him?\n\nMICHAEL BROWN, OBAMA SUPPORTER: Yes, I do, Sean. We and I are probably going to agree on this issue.\n\n\u2022 Video: Watch Sean and Alan's interview\n\nHANNITY: Good for you.\n\nBROWN: Now frankly, it doesn't really matter much. I don't think voters necessarily care, and frankly, Senator Obama and Senator Biden I don't think are really putting that much into it. Clearly, you've taken some snippets.\n\nHANNITY: Snippets? Yes, I know, Jeremiah Wright snippets. Bill Ayers snippets.\n\nBROWN: But at the end of the day \u2014 at the end of the day, Sean, voters don't really matter or care about this particular issue. They do care about \u2014 they do care about the folks who are wondering how they're going to get their next job...\n\nHANNITY: All right. But then why mock \u2014 wait a minute. You can't have it both ways. Here's the difference. And let me go to Tom on this. You can't have it both ways. You can't mock, you know, Joe the plumber...\n\nBROWN: No one's mocking him.\n\nHANNITY: They were mocking \u2014 I don't know any plumber that makes $250,000 a year. The guy wants to own his own business.\n\nAnd Tom, the way I see this race, and maybe \u2014 maybe Sean Hannity is in a different direction than the rest of the country. The guy who had to drop out of college, the guy that was scrubbing pots and pans \u2014 that's me \u2014 when I was 12 years old, you know, trying to make my own way in life, that I was told, \"You need a helping hand, look down at the end of your arm.\" That's your helping hand.\n\nBut what I'm trying to \u2014 I think America has a choice in this election. Either we're going to become European socialists, we're going to be France, and wave the white flag of surrender, and we're going to nationalize health care and we're going to spread, redistribute the wealth, that's our patriotic duty, or we're going to be Americans with individual responsibility. Is that a fair choice that I'm outlining for the American people?\n\nTOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Well, I mean that's the distinction, the contrast that John McCain has been trying to draw with Obama, the sort of traditional liberal-conservative. But he's been terribly ineffective at it until Joe the plumber came along and served as a sort of vehicle in asking this question.\n\nBecause the fundamental issue here is not Joe the plumber or even the question he asked. It's really Obama's response, spreading the wealth around. McCain's been able to key off that to his advantage, I think, over the last couple of days.\n\nALAN COLMES, CO-HOST: Tom and Michael \u2014 Michael, McCain and Biden \u2014 I should say Biden and Obama were not mocking Joe the plumber. They were mocking John McCain \u2014 excuse me. They were mocking John McCain and his use of Joe the plumber and trying to hold this guy up. John McCain vetted Joe the plumber about as well as he vetted Sarah Palin. That's what the problem is.\n\nBROWN: And you know...\n\nHANNITY: That's a cheap shot against Sarah Palin.\n\nCOLMES: No, it's not against Sarah Palin, Sean. It's against John McCain's lack of vetting of a candidate and a bad choice for a vice- presidential...\n\nHANNITY: She's the most popular governor in the country.\n\nCOLMES: You've got a \u2014 we don't need the guests on. We're going to go at it now. You've got a bunch of conservatives going after Sarah Palin. You've got Kathleen Parky (ph). You've got, you know, a whole bunch of conservatives...\n\nHANNITY: Two people.\n\nCOLMES: ... going after and saying she shouldn't be on the ticket. But that's not the issue here. The issue is Joe the plumber, Michael, and it wasn't he who was being \u2014 that was not the target of the comments of Barack Obama and Joe Biden. He wasn't vetted properly by the McCain campaign.\n\nBROWN: Well, I would bet the McCain campaign now are talking about Joe the plumber as much as possible, because any time they can get off the issues that matter to the American people, they think that's a winner for them. Any time they can do distraction politics, they think that's a winner for them.\n\nSo Joe the plumber, you're going to hear about that from John McCain and Sarah Palin for quite a while now.\n\nBut Barack Obama and Joe Biden are going to focus on things that matter.\n\nCOLMES: Also Tom \u2014 yes.\n\nBROWN: Education, gas prices, the economy, foreign policy. Those are things that really matter now to people, not Joe the plumber. I'm sure he's a nice guy and he shouldn't be slandered.\n\nCOLMES: He's probably a great guy and works very, very hard.\n\nBROWN: But Sean, that's a very small issue.\n\nCOLMES: And Tom, you know, this is a guy who, it turns out, is not a swing voter. He's not an independent. He's a registered Republican. He's not a licensed plumber.\n\nAnd, in fact, forget about McCain or anybody else here, you've got the \u2014 or Obama or Biden throwing him down the stairs. You've got the head of his local union saying he's not licensed, he didn't take training, and he shouldn't be calling himself a plumber. That's the head of his union there, not anybody in a political campaign.\n\nBEVAN: But Alan, that's not necessarily the issue. And the idea that the McCain campaign would have to vet a private citizen for asking questions is somewhat ridiculous.\n\nAnd now you've got a situation where you've got John McCain out there defending this guy, who happens to be a working class guy from Ohio. He may not be a swing voter. He may be, you know, a conservative, but that's not the issue. The atmospherics of it are, that you've got McCain defending those kind of voters, and Obama's now kind of mocking them or making fun of them.\n\nCOLMES: Well, I think he's not making \u2014 again, I think he's making fun of McCain for using them, not for the guy himself. But thank you very much for being with us, both of you.\n\nWatch \"Hannity & Colmes\" weeknights at 9 p.m. ET!\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2008 FOX News Network, Inc. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

      "Text": "    * Obama says 19 days from beginning, not end      * Polls show Obama with edge over McCain      * McCain works Joe the plumber into his stump speech           By John Whitesides, Political Correspondent      NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Democratic presidential  nominee Barack Obama warned his supporters to guard against  overconfidence on Thursday as he and underdog Republican rival  John McCain opened a 19-day sprint to Election Day.      The two candidates hit the campaign trail -- Obama in New  York and New Hampshire and McCain in Pennsylvania -- after  their third and last presidential debate on Wednesday, a testy  face-off that made an Ohio plumber famous.      So far, all the stars seemed to be lining up in Obama's  favor. He leads in national opinion polls and in many of the  battleground states where the Nov. 4 race will be won or lost.      Late on Thursday, The Washington Post delivered an  endorsement of Obama and a rebuke to McCain in an editorial on  its web site (www.washingtonpost.com). The Post, one of  America's most respected newspapers, said its endorsement of  Obama was 'without ambivalence.'      'The choice is made easy in part by Mr. McCain's  disappointing campaign, above all his irresponsible selection  of a running mate who is not ready to be president,' the Post  editors wrote. 'It is made easy in larger part, though, because  of our admiration for Mr. Obama and the impressive qualities he  has shown during this long race.'      A confident but cautious Obama told supporters in New York,  'We are now 19 days not from the end but from the beginning.  The amount of work that's going to be involved for the next  president will be extraordinary.'      Traders betting on future events in the political  prediction markets are overwhelmingly predicting an Obama  victory, giving the Illinois Democrat a better than 80 percent  chance of winning.      Ireland's biggest bookmaker, Paddy Power, was already  declaring Obama the winner. The Dublin-based bookmaker said it  would pay out early more than 1 million euros ($1.35 million)  on bets that Obama will be the next U.S. president.           REMEMBERING NEW HAMPSHIRE      But Obama pointed out to deep-pocket contributors at a  fundraising breakfast in Manhattan, and later to supporters in  a driving rain in Londonderry, New Hampshire, that he was  supposed to win New Hampshire last January in the Democratic  primary but lost the state to Sen. Hillary Clinton.      'We are 19 days away from changing this country -- 19 days.  But for those who are getting a little cocky, I've got two  words for you: New Hampshire. I learned right here that you  can't let up or pay too much attention to the polls,' he said.      In New York, he said, 'I've been in these positions before  when we were favored and the press starts getting carried away  and we end up getting spanked.'      The new star in U.S. politics -- at least for a news cycle  or two -- is Joe Wurzelbacher, 'Joe the plumber,' who told  Obama at a campaign stop that he wanted to buy a small plumbing  business in Holland, Ohio.      Joe came up about two dozen times during the debate as each  candidate argued that their prescriptions for America's  economic ills would help the plumber best.      Wurzelbacher was all over morning television shows and was  not saying who he would vote for, but he sounded like a McCain  backer.      'McCain came across with some solid points, and I was real  happy about that,' he told the ",

McCain went on the offensive quickly, criticizing Obama's  proposal to raise taxes on Americans who make more than  $250,000 a year and saying it would hurt small business owners  like a plumber named Joe who Obama met on the campaign trail.      'Why would you want to raise anybody's taxes right now?'  McCain asked Obama. 'We need to encourage businesses.'      Obama said his plan would cut taxes for 95 percent of  Americans and raise them on only a small slice of the most  high-income Americans, while McCain would give tax breaks to  oil and gas companies.      'We both want to cut taxes,' Obama, an Illinois senator,  said in their third and last White House debate at Hofstra  University. 'The difference is who we want to cut taxes for.'      McCain, an Arizona senator, entered the debate under  intense pressure to turn in a strong performance that could  turn around a presidential race that has shifted decisively in  Obama's favor after weeks of economic turmoil and plunging  stock markets.      Opinion polls three weeks before the Nov. 4 election show  more voters say they trust Obama's leadership on the economy,  which has dominated the campaign-trail discussion and dwarfed  McCain's expertise in foreign and military policy.

      "Text": "    * Obama says 19 days from beginning, not end      * Polls show Obama with edge over McCain      * Rivals to meet again at charity dinner        By John Whitesides, Political Correspondent      NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Democratic presidential  nominee Barack Obama warned his supporters to guard against  overconfidence on Thursday as he and underdog Republican rival  John McCain opened a 19-day sprint to Election Day.      The two candidates hit the campaign trail -- Obama raising  money in New York and McCain holding a rally in Pennsylvania --  after their third and last presidential debate on Wednesday, a  testy face-off that made an Ohio plumber famous.      So far, all the stars seemed to be lining up in Obama's  favor. He leads in national opinion polls and in many of the  battleground states where the Nov. 4 race will be won or lost.      Traders betting on future events in the political  prediction markets are overwhelmingly predicting an Obama  victory, giving the Illinois Democrat a better than 80 percent  chance of winning.      But Obama pointed out to deep-pocket contributors at a  fund-raising breakfast in Manhattan that he was supposed to win  New Hampshire last January in the Democratic primary but lost  the state to Sen. Hillary Clinton.      'For those of you who are feeling giddy or cocky or think  this is all set, I just have two words for you: New Hampshire,'  Obama said.      'I've been in these positions before when we were favored  and the press starts getting carried away and we end up getting  spanked,' he said.           NEW POLITICAL STAR      The new star in U.S. politics -- at least for a news cycle  or two -- is Joe Wurzelbacher, 'Joe the plumber,' who told  Obama at a campaign stop that he wanted to buy a small plumbing  business in Holland, Ohio.      Joe came up about two dozen times during the debate as each  candidate argued that their prescriptions for America's  economic ills would help the plumber best.      Wurzelbacher was all over morning television shows and was  not saying who he would vote for, but he sounded like a McCain  backer.      'McCain came across with some solid points, and I was real  happy about that,' he told the Toledo Blade newspaper.      Although McCain went after Obama aggressively in the final  debate, it might not have done much to change the shape of the  race in its final stages.      Karl Rove, the architect of President George W. Bush's two  electoral victories and now a political pundit, wrote in The  Wall Street Journal on Thursday that McCain has difficult but  not impossible odds.      'If Mr. McCain succeeds, he will have engineered the most  impressive and improbable political comeback since Harry Truman  in 1948. But having to reach back more than a half-century for  inspiration is not the place campaign managers want to be now,'  Rove wrote.      The two candidates will be on the same stage again on  Thursday night when they give speeches at the Al Smith charity  dinner, a political tradition in Manhattan named for the former  New York governor and a regular stop for presidential  candidates.

      "Text": "    * Obama to drop off campaign trail to visit grandmother      * McCain gives strong support to running mate Palin      * Obama widens his lead in poll           By Steve Holland      ORMOND BEACH, Fla., Oct 23 (Reuters) - Republican  presidential nominee John McCain hammered Democrat Barack Obama  on taxes and national security on Thursday on a bus tour across  parts of Florida crucial to his hopes of winning on Nov. 4.      Trailing in opinion polls both nationally and in many key  states, McCain is facing an increasingly difficult path to  victory and finds himself racing to defend states that have  voted Republican in recent elections.      With less than two weeks before the election, Obama leads  McCain 52 percent to 40 percent among likely voters in the  latest three-day tracking poll by Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby.      McCain is resting his hopes on instigating a 'Joe the  Plumber' voter uprising against the better-funded Obama by  whipping up populist sentiment over Obama's comment to Ohio  plumber Joe Wurzelbacher that raising taxes on people making  more than $250,000 a year would allow Washington to 'spread the  wealth around.'      McCain called that redistribution of income and said it  would hurt small businesses responsible for much of the  country's jobs. Some people at his rally were waving 'Joe the  Plumber' T-shirts.      'He's more concerned about using taxes to spread the wealth  than creating a tax plan that creates jobs and grows our  economy,' Arizona Sen. McCain told a cheering throng at an  Ormond Beach lumber yard.      'Sen. Obama is more interested in controlling who gets your  piece of pie than he is in growing the pie,' McCain said.      Illinois Sen. Obama says his tax plan would give 95 percent  of Americans a tax break.      Obama was taking a one-day break from the presidential race  to make a personal journey to see his ailing grandmother in  Hawaii, ceding a day of campaigning to McCain less than two  weeks before the election.           PRIVATE TIME      Obama will spend private time in Honolulu on Friday  visiting Madelyn Dunham, the woman who helped raise him and who  he affectionately calls 'Toot' -- short for 'tutu,' the  Hawaiian word for grandmother.      The 85-year-old Dunham recently broke her hip and is very  ill. Obama said he did not want to repeat the mistake he made  with his mother, who died of cancer before he could reach her  bedside.      McCain was on a bus tour across Florida's 'Interstate 4  corridor,' a 12-county section of Central Florida in which he  needs a large voter turnout on Nov. 4 to save a state that  Republicans have taken in the last two presidential elections.  Polls show a neck-and-neck race in Florida.      In Ormond Beach, McCain strongly supported his vice  presidential running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who has  energized the party's base but has had a difficult introduction  to the national scene, getting mixed reviews for a couple of  national television interviews.      A story in the Politico on Wednesday that the Republican  National Committee spent $150,000 on her wardrobe only added to  the negative picture surrounding Palin.      'My friends, I am so proud of Sarah Palin and what she  represents -- reform and family and all of the things we value.  I'm very proud of her and I know that you are too,' he said.      McCain was sharply critical of Obama of a remark by Obama's  vice presidential running mate, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware,  that Obama is boun",

Trailing in opinion polls both nationally and in many key  states, McCain is facing an increasingly difficult path to  victory and finds himself racing to defend states that have  voted Republican in recent elections.      With less than two weeks before the election, Obama leads  McCain 52 percent to 40 percent among likely voters in the  latest three-day tracking poll by Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby.      McCain is resting his hopes on instigating a 'Joe the  Plumber' voter uprising against the better-funded Obama by  whipping up populist sentiment over Obama's comment to Ohio  plumber Joe Wurzelbacher that raising taxes on people making  more than $250,000 a year would allow Washington to 'spread the  wealth around.'      McCain called that redistribution of income and said it  would hurt small businesses that he said have been doing some  of the only hiring at a time when claims for jobless benefits  rose by a larger than expected 15,000 last week.      'We'll restore this economy, get it on track and we won't  do it by 'spreading the wealth' around and increasing  somebody's taxes and take one group of Americans' money and  give it to another. We've seen that movie before,' McCain said,  standing outside a Puerto Rican restaurant in Orlando.      Some people at his rally in Ormond Beach were waving 'Joe  the Plumber' T-shirts.      'He's more concerned about using taxes to spread the wealth  than creating a tax plan that creates jobs and grows our  economy,' Arizona Sen. McCain told a cheering throng at an  Ormond Beach lumber yard.      Illinois Sen. Obama says his tax plan would give 95 percent  of Americans a tax break.      Obama was taking a one-day break from the presidential race  to make a personal journey to see his ailing grandmother in  Hawaii, ceding a day of campaigning to McCain less than two  weeks before the election.           PRIVATE TIME      Obama will spend private time in Honolulu on Friday  visiting Madelyn Dunham, the woman who helped raise him and who  he affectionately calls 'Toot' -- short for 'tutu,' the  Hawaiian word for grandmother.      But before he left, he criticized McCain's proposal to cut  the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent at a rally  in Indianapolis that drew an estimated 35,000 people.      'Well, Indiana, my opponent may call that 'fundamental  economics,' but we know that's just another name for the Wall  Street first, Main Street last kind of economic philosophy  we've had for the past eight years -- and that's fundamentally  wrong,' Obama said.      McCain was on a bus tour across Florida's 'Interstate 4  corridor,' a 12-county section of Central Florida in which he  needs a large voter turnout on Nov. 4 to save a state that  Republicans have taken in the last two presidential elections.  Polls show a neck-and-neck race in Florida.      The tour took him from a lumberyard in Ormond Beach to a  dentist office in Altamonte Springs and a Puerto Rican  restaurant in Orlando.      In Ormond Beach, McCain strongly supported his vice  presidential ",

McCain's broadside, delivered at stops throughout central  Florida, prompted Obama to fire back that McCain's economic  proposals would give corporations a tax break for shipping jobs  overseas -- a 'Wall Street first, Main Street last' strategy.

McCain called Obama's plan a redistribution of income and  said it would hurt small businesses that he said have been  doing some of the only hiring at a time when claims for jobless  benefits rose by a larger than expected 15,000 last week.      'Senator Obama may say he's going to soak the rich but it's  the middle class who are going to get wet,' McCain said in  Sarasota.      McCain strongly supported his vice presidential running  mate, Alaska Gov.

'I can tell you what, she's far more qualified than  Joe the Biden' -- a reference to Obama's vice presidential  running mate, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware.      Asked about the clothes, McCain told a group of Florida  reporters on his bus that she needed clothes at the time and  that they would be donated to charity, according to WFLA  television.      In Ormond Beach, McCain said it was critical to keep people  facing foreclosure in their homes.      He criticized the Bush administration for not buying  troubled mortgages to allow homeowners facing foreclosure to  get a better interest rate on their loans as part of a $700  billion Wall Street bailout. He complained particularly about  Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.      'Why isn't the secretary of the Treasury ordering them to  do that?' he said.

      "Text": "Trust but verify.\n\n-- Ronald Reagan\n\nIt's good practice to take a person at his word until someone shows you proof he is lying.\n\nBarack Obama says he was born in Hawaii, and since no one has shown any proof he was born in Kenya or elsewhere, it's OK to conclude he was born in Hawaii.\n\nSure his grammar school records show that he was enrolled as an Indonesian Muslim, but some people will say anything to get their kid in the right school. It doesn't really answer the question.\n\nIt's OK though for others not to use my deferential standard and continue to question whether Obama was born in Hawaii. We aren't talking about a 12-year-old qualifying to play Little League here. There is a Constitutional mandate that the President be a natural-born citizen, and if Obama is not one, he certainly will have committed the biggest fraud since the White Sox threw the World Series.\n\nThe reason why people still question Obama's citizen status is one-fold: \"President Transparency\" has refused to release any original documents on the matter. He can end the controversy in a day by releasing original documents, but for some inexplicable reason he refuses, and his love-struck media never asks him why he won't. The media instead spends hell-bent hours on making the Birther movement look like fringy, conspiracy-hungry kooks.\n\nYou have to admit though, even if you are a devout Obama-bot, Obama's refusal to release any original documents makes for a newsworthy story by itself.\n\nIf he really wants the Birthers to shut up, he has the power to do it by releasing the original documents. Why not just do it then? It's a simple task. Why not get rid of a conversation that has been with America since the campaign?\n\nThe issue is the subject of several lawsuits, which only seek a peek at original documents. Can anyone explain why it is smarter for Obama to spend tens of thousands of dollars and man-hours defending the suits when he can win the lawsuit for free by showing the original documents?\n\nBy defending the lawsuits and not showing the documents, Obama feeds the suspicion of those who already think he is lying. That's why this issue has the power to linger, and that's Obama's fault alone.\n\nLet's look at what Obama has released, and you will see they are hearsay documents and not best evidence.\n\nThe Birth Certificate: The certificate put on the Internet by Obama and held up by the media was created in 2007. In the lower left corner of the form there is reference to a Hawaiian statute that was revised in November of 2001, and if you look closely at the front you can see bleeding through from the back the date stamp from 2007 when the document was created. It's a certification that an original does exit.\n\nSo the the Birthers say: \"Fine. Then show us the original.\" Obama says, \"No.\" Why?\n\nThe Newspaper Announcements: Two birth announcements from Hawaiian local papers show Obama's birth. The Birthers have a couple of good arguments about them. First, Hawaii is where Obama's grandparents lived and it's not unusual for grandparents to announce a birth to their friends, even if the grandson lives elsewhere. Also, if Obama's parents lived in Hawaii then moved to Kenya when they birthed him, it wouldn't be unusual to announce the birth in the old neighborhood for friends to see.\n\nThe newspaper announcements cut against the Birthers, but they are hearsay documents and don't answer the citizen question any more than his grammar school records prove he is a Muslim. The original Birth Certificate will end it all.\n\nSchool Records: The Birthers believe that Obama's records from college and graduate school will show he matriculated as a foreign born student. This is easy -- shut them up by releasing them! Obama's response? \"No.\" Why?\n\nThis one reminds me of John Kerry not releasing his Yale records until after the election. During the campaign Kerry soaked in the warm media bath that swore he was the intellectual and George Bush the dolt. When the records came out later it was quietly reported that George Bush had a higher grade point average at Yale.\n\nMedia's penchant to cover for Democrat candidates fuels the Birther fire as well. See as an example John Edwards' love affair.\n\nFinancial Aid Records: Barack Obama relishes his own personal Sonia Sotomayor-like story of how he came from a broken home and pulled himself up by his own bootstraps. But he refuses to show how his very expensive tuition at Occidental College, Columbia University and Harvard Law School were paid for.\n\nThe Birthers believe the records will show Obama received financial aid as a foreign born student. Obama says they won't. Not to sound like a broken record, but releasing the records will end the controversy, and Obama refuses. Why?\n\nThe Birther movement is Obama's fault for not releasing the records. I hope the Birthers continue to bite his ankles until he releases the records. He deserves nothing less.\n\nRead more Tommy De Seno at www.JustifiedRight.com",

      "Text": "    * 'Obama-mania' sweeps into Washington      * Enthusiasm tempered by grim economic news      * Cheney, Biden make news on eve of inauguration           By Steve Holland      WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Barack Obama was poised to  make history on Tuesday as America's first black president,  riding the optimism of millions of people into power and  inheriting a recession and two wars that will test his skills.      Obama, 47, the son of a Kenyan father and a white mother  from Kansas, was set to take the oath of office at midday (0500  GMT) on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, his hand placed on a  Bible used by Abraham Lincoln at his first inauguration in  1861.      Obama's inauguration culminates the hopes and dreams of  generations of African-Americans who suffered slavery and then  racial segregation policies that made them second-class  citizens.      He assumes the mantle of power at a moment of great anxiety  among Americans who have seen hundreds of thousands of jobs  vanish in past months and left them fearful an economic  collapse could turn a crisis into a catastrophe.      The 'Obama-mania' that helped propel Obama into office was  alive on the streets of Washington.      A winter chill failed to dampen the spirits of more than 1  million people who swept into the U.S. capital to witness the  pomp and ceremony and revel in the festivities surrounding  Obama's inauguration as the 44th U.S. president.      'Slavery to History, The Obama Inauguration,' was the  slogan on a handwritten cardboard sign held by a smiling man on  a downtown sidewalk.      Thousands of security personnel were in place to maintain  order and guard against an attack. Much of the city center was  barricaded and shut down to vehicular traffic.      In an eagerly anticipated inauguration address he has been  working on for weeks, Obama will rally Americans to an era of  responsibility, urging them to join in a spirit of unity to  take on difficult issues.      'Government can only do so much,' he told participants in a  service project honoring slain civil rights leader Martin  Luther King Jr. on Monday. 'We're going to have to take  responsibility -- all of us.'      Obama in recent days has stressed that Americans should  expect even rougher economic times and that his plan to revive  the struggling economy will take time to work.           OBAMA HONORS MCCAIN, COLIN POWELL      The president-to-be appeared in a giddy mood on Monday  night as he spent the evening at dinners honoring former  Republican rival John McCain, former Secretary of State Colin  Powell and Vice President-elect Joe Biden.      At the event for McCain, he could not resist referring to  the sometimes testy campaign debates in which they took part.      'I'm here tonight to say a few words about an American hero  I have come to know very well and admire very much -- Senator  John McCain. And then, according to the rules agreed to by both  parties, John will have approximately 30 seconds to make a  rebuttal,' he said.      Crowds of people clapped as Obama's motorcade sped through  the city en route to the various dinners.      Favorable winds were blowing at Obama's back despite the  long to-do list he inherits from President George W. Bush. A  realclearpolitics.com average of recent polls showed a  remarkable 73 percent of Americans had a favorable view of  Obama.      By contrast, Bush leaves with sagging poll numbers, weighed  down by wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the worst ",

      "Text": "    Jan 20 (Reuters) - Barack Obama will be sworn in as the  44th president of the United States at noon on Tuesday.      Here are some biographical facts about the first  African-American to hold the nation's highest office.        Age: 47      Birthdate: Aug. 4, 1961      Birthplace: Honolulu, Hawaii      Education: Columbia University; Harvard Law School      Wife: Michelle Robinson Obama      Children: Daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7      Religious affiliation: United Church of Christ      Party: Democrat        Family: Barack Obama was born to a Kenyan father and a  white American mother. His father, Barack Obama Sr., married  his mother, Ann Dunham, while studying at the University of  Hawaii. The couple separated two years after Obama was born.  His father ultimately returned to Kenya, where he became a  noted economist. He died in a car accident in 1982.      Obama's mother's second marriage was to an Indonesian man  named Lolo Soetoro. The family moved to Indonesia and Obama  remained there until he was 10 when he moved back to Hawaii and  lived with his grandparents while studying on a scholarship at  the elite Punahou Academy.      He has seven half brothers and sisters in Kenya from his  father's other marriages, and a half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng,  from his mother's second marriage.        Career: After finishing college in 1983, Obama worked for a  New York financial consultancy and a consumer organization. He  landed a job in Chicago in 1985 as an organizer for Developing  Communities Project, a church-based group seeking to improve  living conditions in poor neighborhoods.      Three years later, Obama left to go to Harvard Law School,  where he became the first black president of the law review. He  worked as a summer associate at the Sidley Austin law firm in  Chicago, where he met his future wife. After graduation from  Harvard in 1991, Obama practiced civil rights law at a small  firm in Chicago, then became a lecturer in constitutional law  at the University of Chicago in 1993.        Elective office: Obama won a seat in the Illinois state  Senate in 1996. During his time in the Legislature, he worked  on welfare and ethics legislation, as well as a measure  requiring electronic recording of police interrogations and  confessions in homicide investigations.      Obama won a heavily contested U.S. Senate seat in 2004,  carrying 53 percent of the Democratic primary vote in an  eight-candidate race. He easily won the general election as  well. In the U.S. Senate he compiled a liberal voting record,  but was one of the few Democrats to back a measure on  class-action lawsuits. He opposed the appointment of Chief  Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito to the U.S.  Supreme Court.      The nonpartisan National Journal ranked him as the most  liberal member of the U.S. Senate early this year based on his  voting record in 2007. He was ranked 10th most liberal in 2006  and 16th most liberal in 2005.           Presidential campaign: Obama announced his presidential  candidacy on Feb. 10, 2007. Though New York Sen. Hillary  Clinton was initially seen as the front-runner for the  Democratic nomination, Obama quickly showed an ability to raise  large amounts of money and draw record-breaking crowds who were  attracted to his rhetorical skill, his opposition to the Iraq  war, and his promise to move beyond the divisive politics of  the past 40 years.      Obama won the first contest of the Democratic primary in  Iowa in",

      "Text": "    By Ellen Wulfhorst      PHILADELPHIA, April 16 (Reuters) - Rock superstar Bruce  Springsteen on Wednesday endorsed Democratic Sen. Barack Obama  for U.S. president, saying he stands 'head and shoulders above  the rest.'      In a message posted on his Web site, the musician and  songwriter known as the Boss said the Illinois senator has 'the  depth, the reflectiveness and the resilience' to be the next  U.S. president.      'Like most of you, I've been following the campaign and I  have now seen and heard enough to know where I stand. Sen.  Obama, in my view, is head and shoulders above the rest,' he  wrote.      Many of Springsteen's rousing rock anthems and haunting  ballads celebrate working class Americans. His endorsement in  the November presidential election comes as Obama fends off  charges he is out of touch with working class voters.      The Obama campaign welcomed the endorsement. The America of  Springsteen's songs -- with its hardworking people and big  dreams -- is 'a story I know and a vision I share for our  future, and that's why I'm so honored to have his support in  this journey,' Obama said in a statement.

'Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real,'  Obama said in his inaugural speech shortly after taking the  oath of office. 'They are serious and they are many. They will  not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this,  America -- they will be met.'      Hundreds of thousands of people erupted in roars of  approval on the broad National Mall grounds as they watched  Obama stand with one hand raised, one hand on a Bible used to  swear in Abraham Lincoln in 1861, and repeat the brief oath to  become the 44th U.S. president and succeed George W. Bush.      The inauguration of Obama, 47, the son of a black Kenyan  father and a white mother from Kansas, was steeped in symbolic  meaning for African-Americans, who for generations suffered  slavery and then racial segregation that made them second-class  citizens.      Beaming broadly, the new president had kisses for his wife,  Michelle, and his school-age daughters, Malia and Sasha, then  he turned to the crowds stretching away into the distance on a  cold, wintry day.      'Obama, Obama,' the crowd cheered.       Dispatching quickly with pleasantries, Obama turned to the  task at hand and sought to temper the soaring optimism about  his leadership with reality. A Democrat, he took over from  Republican Bush, who served two terms and whose approval  ratings plumbed record lows.      Obama cited the worst U.S. economic conditions in 70 years  and U.S. involvement in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as having  placed the country 'in the midst of crisis.'      'On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over  fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord,' he said.      He pledged bold and swift action on the 'badly weakened'  U.S. economy, a top priority as he works with the U.S. Congress  on an estimated $850 billion economic stimulus package aimed at  jolting the economy back to life.      U.S. stock indexes extended losses and hit session lows  after his speech, which provided few details on how to tackle  the crisis.[ID:nN20414587]             VOWS 'NEW WAY FORWARD' WITH MUSLIMS      After years of tense relations with Muslims following the  Sept. 11 attacks seven years ago that prompted Washington's  declared war on terrorism and deeply shaped Bush's policies,  Obama offered conciliatory words to the Islamic community while  issuing a warning to those who would wage terrorism.      In a message to the Muslim world, Obama said he would seek  a 'new way forward' based on mutual interest and mutual  respect.      He added: 'We will not apologize for our way of life, nor  will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance  their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we  say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be  broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.'      In his first act of business, the Obama White House issued  a proclamation declaring a national day of renewal and  reconciliation and calling on Americans to serve one another.

      "Text": "    WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Jimmy  Carter, one of a handful of high-profile Democrats who has  remained neutral in his party's presidential primary battle,  has hinted that he supports Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton,  according to news reports on Friday.      Traveling in Nigeria, Carter said his home state of Georgia  and his hometown of Plains backed Obama in the state's Feb. 5  primary. His children, their spouses and his grandchildren  support Obama as well, he said.      'As a superdelegate, I would not disclose who I am rooting  for but I leave it to you to make that guess,' ABC News quoted  Carter as saying.      Democratic party rules allow elected officials and party  insiders, termed 'superdelegates,' to back whom they want at  the party's nominating convention.      Those who remain unaligned are being urgently courted by  both campaigns, as they could mean the difference between  victory and defeat in the hard-fought battle to win the party's  nomination and take on presumptive Republican nominee John  McCain in the November election.      Neither Obama, an Illinois senator who would be the first  black president, nor Clinton, a New York senator who would be  the first woman president, is likely to clinch the nomination  through the state-by-state primaries and caucuses that continue  through June.      Other prominent superdelegates who remain uncommitted  include U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and  former Vice President Al Gore, the 2000 Democratic presidential  nominee.

      "Text": "    By Jeff Mason      CHICAGO, Nov 25 (Reuters) - There may be only one U.S.  president at a time, but you wouldn't know it by watching  Barack Obama this week.      The Democratic president-elect, who kept a low profile for  three weeks after his White House win, has swung into action  with a series of economic pronouncements and cabinet selections  that have overshadowed President George W. Bush.      If financial markets are clamoring for more leadership,  Obama got the message.      'There is a leadership vacuum. If Obama doesn't fill it,  more panic will result in (the) short run, and the problem will  become greater by the time he officially takes office,' said  Stephen Wayne, professor of government at Georgetown  University.      'It is still Bush's power to act now, but Obama's  obligation to tell jittery Americans what he plans to do.'      On Monday Obama held a news conference to announce his  economic team. Flanked by flags and new staff members, he vowed  to jolt the economy with an aggressive new stimulus package.      On Tuesday Obama held another press event, this time  announcing his pick to run the White House budget office and  intention to cut billions of dollars in wasteful spending.      Both days he took questions from reporters while his  heavyweight appointments -- including New York Federal Reserve  Chairman President Timothy Geithner as Treasury secretary --  stood behind him, silent. He has another news conference  scheduled for Wednesday.      Meanwhile, back in Washington, Bush had coffee with his  Treasury secretary, told reporters he was keeping his successor  apprised of steps to secure the financial system, and took a  trip to visit troops in Kentucky.      On the pressing issue of the day -- the economy -- the man  who will be the next president of the United States very much  upstaged the current White House occupant, prompting a question  on Tuesday about his oft-stated pronouncement that the country  only had one head of state at a time.      'Well, there is only one president at a time. That  president is George W. Bush, and he will be president until I'm  sworn in on January 20th,' Obama said, when asked how he  squared his involvement in the economy with that fact.      '(But) I think it is very important for the American people  to understand that we are putting together a first-class team  and for them to have clarity that we don't intend to stumble  into the next administration.'           LEADERSHIP VACUUM      No stumbling so far. Obama has drawn accolades for his  appointments, though his refusal to give his stimulus package a  price tag caused U.S. stocks to pare gains briefly on Monday.      Paul Beck, a professor of political science at Ohio State  University, said the current transition recalled the situation  in 1932 when Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt took over from  Republican Herbert Hoover in the midst of an economic  disaster.      'It is not normal that a president-elect would get involved  in this way, but these are not normal times,' he said, adding  that Bush's credibility had eroded to the point that he was not  taken seriously within the financial markets.      'The economy will not wait for the transition to be  completed. That was a problem in 1932, and subsequently we  moved the presidential inauguration from March to January.   Now, we are finding out that January is not early enough.'      Obama takes over from Bush on Jan. 20. He has urged the  next U.S. Congress",

Kennedy collapses at luncheon           (Refiles to fix typos in paragraph 3)      By Steve Holland and Caren Bohan      WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Barack Obama took power as  the first black U.S. president on Tuesday and quickly turned  the page on the Bush years, urging Americans to rally to end  the worst economic crisis in 70 years and repair the U.S. image  abroad.      'Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves  off, and begin again the work of remaking America,' Obama said,  addressing an exuberant sea of people in an inaugural speech  that was both optimistic but realistic about the challenges  ahead.      He pledged bold and swift action to bring new life to the  U.S. economy and declared to millions watching abroad that, 'We  are ready to lead once more.'      But illustrating the tough road ahead, Wall Street ushered  in the new presidency with the record Inauguration Day slide  amid signs the global banking crisis was far from over.  [ID:nN20429093]      Hundreds of thousands of people erupted in roars of  approval on Washington's broad National Mall grounds as they  watched Obama stand with one hand raised, one hand on a Bible  used to swear in Abraham Lincoln in 1861, and repeat the brief  oath to become the 44th U.S. president.      Beaming, the new president kissed his wife, Michelle, and  his school-age daughters, Malia and Sasha. Then he turned to  the crowds stretching into the distance on a cold, wintry day.      'Obama, Obama,' the crowd cheered.      Obama, a Democrat, replaced Republican George W. Bush, who  served two terms and left office having plumbed record lows in  approval ratings and leaving a legacy of two wars and an  economy in recession.           WALKING SOME OF THE WAY      During a triumphant ride down Pennsylvania Avenue to the  White House in a heavily armored limousine, Obama and his wife  thrilled wildly cheering crowds by getting out of the limo and  walking a part of the way on foot.      Security personnel -- part of a contingent that numbered in  the thousands -- kept close watch.      Obama has to hit the ground running given the state of the  economy and the U.S. Senate confirmed several key Obama  appointments, including Steven Chu as energy secretary and Tom  Vilsack for agriculture. The Senate Finance Committee is  expected to vote on Timothy Geithner as treasury secretary on  Thursday.      The inauguration of Obama, 47, the son of a black Kenyan  father and a white mother from Kansas, was steeped in symbolism  for African-Americans, who for generations suffered slavery and  then racial segregation that made them second-class citizens.      In a nod to that history, Obama lauded the people who built  the country from its foundation, including those who 'endured  the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.'      The jubilant mood was jolted by the collapse of  Massachusetts Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy at an inaugural  lunch honoring Obama on Capitol Hill. Kennedy, 76, who  underwent surgery in June for a brain tumor, appeared to suffer  convulsions, a congressional aide said.      Wheeled out on a stretcher, the respected brother of the  late President John F. Kennedy was driven away by an ambulance  to a hospital, where he was described as awake and answering  questions.

      "Text": " (Updates with Obama win in South Carolina)      By John Whitesides, Political Correspondent      COLUMBIA, S.C., Jan 26 (Reuters) - Barack Obama won a vital  contest in South Carolina on Saturday in his quest for the U.S.  Democratic presidential nomination, showing strength among  southern blacks who make up half the state's Democratic  voters.      After losses in New Hampshire and Nevada, the victory gave  Obama, who would be the first black president, a big lift  heading into the Super Tuesday contests on Feb. 5, when nearly  half of the U.S. states will pick Republican and Democratic  candidates for the November election.      South Carolina was the latest test for Obama, who would be  the first black U.S president, and Clinton, a New York senator,  in their escalating battle for the right to represent the  Democratic Party in November's presidential election.      After two consecutive losses, in New Hampshire and Nevada,  Obama needed a win on Saturday if he hopes to head into the  Feb. 5 'Super Tuesday' contests in two dozen states with a  realistic chance of victory.      The high stakes fueled a week of angry accusations, harsh  advertisements and increasingly personal jabs between the two  candidates, capped by a volley of attacks on Obama from  Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton.      Obama and Hillary Clinton visited with voters in South  Carolina during the day -- Obama visited a polling station and  a restaurant, while Clinton visited two restaurants.      Clinton left South Carolina before the polls closed, headed  to Tennessee -- which votes on Feb. 5 -- for a town hall  meeting in Nashville.      The other candidate in the Democratic race, former North  Carolina Sen. John Edwards, who won South Carolina during his  failed 2004 presidential bid, was in a battle with Clinton for  second place.

      "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Democrat Barack Obama won the  endorsement of The Washington Post in an editorial saying the  Illinois senator 'has the potential to become a great  president.'      The newspaper said its choice was made easy in part by the  'disappointing campaign' of Republican candidate John McCain and  his decision to pick Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, as his  vice presidential running mate for the Nov. 4 election.      'It is made easy in larger part, though, because of our  admiration for Mr. Obama and the impressive qualities he has  shown during this long race,' the Post said in the editorial for  its Friday editions published on its website on Thursday night.      The paper, which endorsed Democrats in the two previous  presidential elections, praised Obama as a 'man of supple  intelligence, with a nuanced grasp of complex issues and evident  skill at conciliation and consensus-building.'      It said Obama also has a sophisticated understanding of the  world and America's place in it and that he was committed to  maintaining U.S. leadership.      In endorsing Obama, the Post said a McCain presidency would  not equal four more years of Bush administration policies. But  the paper said McCain would draw on many of the same policymakers  who have brought the country to its current state.      'We believe they have richly earned, and might even benefit  from, some years in the political wilderness,' the editorial  said.

'It is still Bush's power to act now, but Obama's  obligation to tell jittery Americans what he plans to do.'      On Monday Obama held a news conference to announce his  economic team. Flanked by flags and new staff members, he vowed  to jolt the economy with an aggressive new stimulus package.      On Tuesday Obama held another press event, this time  announcing his pick to run the White House budget office and  intention to cut billions of dollars in wasteful spending.      Both days he took questions from reporters while his  heavyweight appointments -- including New York Federal Reserve  Chairman President Timothy Geithner as Treasury secretary --  stood behind him, silent. He has another news conference  scheduled for Wednesday.      Meanwhile, back in Washington, Bush had coffee with his  Treasury secretary, told reporters he was keeping his successor  apprised of steps to secure the financial system, and took a  trip to visit troops in Kentucky.      On the pressing issue of the day -- the economy -- the man  who will be the next president of the United States very much  upstaged the current White House occupant, prompting a question  on Tuesday about his oft-stated pronouncement that the country  only had one head of state at a time.      'Well, there is only one president at a time. That  president is George W. Bush, and he will be president until I'm  sworn in on January 20th,' Obama said, when asked how he  squared his involvement in the economy with that fact.      '(But) I think it is very important for the American people  to understand that we are putting together a first-class team  and for them to have clarity that we don't intend to stumble  into the next administration.'           LEADERSHIP VACUUM      No stumbling so far. Obama has drawn accolades for his  appointments, though his refusal to give his stimulus package a  price tag caused U.S. stocks to pare gains briefly on Monday.      Paul Beck, a professor of political science at Ohio State  University, said the current transition recalled the situation  in 1932 when Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt took over from  Republican Herbert Hoover in the midst of an economic  disaster.      'It is not normal that a president-elect would get involved  in this way, but these are not normal times,' he said, adding  that Bush's credibility had eroded to the point that he was not  taken seriously within the financial markets.      'The economy will not wait for the transition to be  completed. That was a problem in 1932, and subsequently we  moved the presidential inauguration from March to January.   Now, we are finding out that January is not early enough.'      Obama takes over from Bush on Jan. 20.",

      "Text": "    The U.S. Congress, handing President Barack Obama a major  legislative victory, approved on Friday a $787 billion stimulus  bill that aims to rush emergency government spending and tax cuts  to a nation in the grip of a severe recession.

      "Text": "    *Obama will sign stimulus legislation Tuesday      *Congressional approval gives Obama much-needed boost      *Republicans say much of bill's spending 'wasteful'           By Matt Spetalnick      CHICAGO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on  Saturday hailed congressional approval of a $787 billion  economic stimulus bill as a 'major milestone on our road to  recovery' and the White House said he would sign the  legislation on Tuesday in Denver.      'I will sign this legislation into law shortly, and we'll  begin making the immediate investments necessary to put people  back to work,' Obama said, savoring his biggest legislative  victory since taking office on Jan. 20.      The Senate cast the final vote, 60-38, late on Friday,  hours after the House of Representatives passed an identical  bill, 246-183, capping weeks of arguing over how to best jolt  the economy out of deep recession.      Obama and his fellow Democrats who control Congress failed  to win over many Republicans, falling short of the broad  bipartisan support he sought for the massive package of  increased spending and tax cuts.      But Obama brushed off partisan bickering over the stimulus  bill as 'healthy differences of opinion.'      'Congress has passed my economic recovery plan -- an  ambitious plan at a time we badly need it,' he said in his  weekly radio address delivered during his first trip home to  Chicago since assuming the presidency. 'This is a major  milestone on our road to recovery.'      Obama, who had warned that economic crisis could turn to  catastrophe without rapid government intervention, said the  stimulus would 'lay a new foundation' for lasting growth.      The White House has said it will take about a month for the  money to start flowing. But a primary concern for economists is  that the stimulus will come too late to do much good in 2009,  when many forecasters think full-year output will contract.           MUCH-NEEDED BOOST      Despite that, final passage of the stimulus bill gives a  much-needed boost to the new president, whose 'No-drama Obama'  image has come under strain of late.      He has had an uneven start, dealing with an uproar over the  tax problems of several top Cabinet choices and the abrupt  withdrawal last week of his nominee for commerce secretary,  Republican Sen. Judd Gregg, citing policy differences.      But Obama has kept his approval ratings high by tackling  the economy as his top domestic priority. His recipe includes   middle-class tax cuts, infrastructure spending, help for the  poor and unemployed and investment in alternative energy.      He predicts that the stimulus plan will save or create more  than 3.5 million jobs over the next two years.      But the stimulus debate in Congress has also laid bare  bitter divisions over how to boost an economy suffering a  rising jobless rate of 7.6 percent and a banking crisis that  has nearly frozen lending.      Only three Republicans voted for the measure in the  100-seat Senate, and no Republicans broke ranks to support it  the House, arguing it had too much spending and not enough tax  breaks. The final plan was split into 36 percent for tax cuts  and 64 percent in spending and other provisions.      Sen. Lisa Murkowski, delivering the Republicans' radio  address, said Democrats should be mindful that funding spent on  stimulus 'isn't Monopoly money' and it adds to the federal  deficit. 'Much of the spending is wasteful,' she said.      But Oba",

      "Text": "    By Thomas Ferraro and Susan Cornwell      WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama predicted  a 'difficult next few days' as the Democratic-controlled U.S.  Senate on Monday debated an almost $900 billion stimulus package  of federal spending and tax cuts amid Republican opposition.      Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said he hoped to  push the measure through the chamber by Friday after considering a  stack of amendments offered by Republicans as well as members of  his own party.      But Republicans -- who last week withheld support from a  similar measure in the Democratic-controlled House of  Representatives --  appeared ready to fight to put more emphasis  on tax cuts and less on new spending.      'We're not trying to prevent a package from passing. We're  trying to reform it -- reformulate it,' Senate Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell told a Capitol Hill news conference.      McConnell, of Kentucky, said most members of his party  believed the package can be trimmed and should be aimed initially  at easing record home foreclosures, which have largely been blamed  for the deepening recession.      At the White House, Obama told reporters, 'There are still  some differences between Democrats and Republicans ... between  the White House and some of the products that have been  discussed.      'But what we can't do is let various modest differences get in  the way of the overall package moving forward swiftly,' he said.      Obama, who met on Capitol Hill last week with House and Senate  Republicans, planned to confer at the White House later in the day  with congressional Democratic leaders.           LIBERAL WISH LIST?      Many Republicans and some Democrats have complained that a  number of provisions in the package would not stimulate the  economy and are little more than a liberal wish list, such as $50  million to promote the arts and $335 million to educate people  about sexually transmitted diseases.      McConnell said Republicans would seek to help battered  homeowners, key victims in the fiscal downturn.      Republicans will propose providing government-backed home  mortgages at an interest rate of 4 percent to credit-worthy  borrowers, McConnell said.      Obama, in an interview with NBC on late Sunday, said, 'We're  going to be trimming out things that are not relevant to putting  people back to work right now.'      Said McConnell, 'I couldn't agree with that more.'      The Senate bill contains $342 billion in temporary tax  breaks and more than $545 billion in spending to total about  $887 billion.      Spending proposals include measures to upgrade education and  healthcare, bolster energy programs and rebuild crumbling roads  and bridges.      The House passed a somewhat different version last week  without any Republican support. Senate Democrats will need at  least two Republican votes, however, to clear possible procedural  roadblocks.      Once the Senate passes its bill, negotiators from the two  chambers will seek to resolve differences and then send a final  bill to Obama to sign into law. The president has said he wants  such legislation by the middle of the month.      Speaking with reporters at the White House, Obama said he  expected a 'difficult next few days' as the Senate wrangles  over a stimulus bill.      But the president voiced optimism that a final bill could  be crafted within the next few weeks.      'We can put America back to work and start digging  ourselves ou",

      "Text": "    * 'Obama-mania' sweeps into Washington      * Enthusiasm tempered by grim economic news      * Cheney, Biden make news on eve of inauguration           By Steve Holland      WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Barack Obama was poised to  make history on Tuesday as America's first black president,  riding the optimism of millions of people into power and  inheriting a recession and two wars that will test his skills.      Obama, 47, the son of a Kenyan father and a white mother  from Kansas, was set to take the oath of office at midday (0500  GMT) on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, his hand placed on a  Bible used by Abraham Lincoln at his first inauguration in  1861.      Obama's inauguration culminates the hopes and dreams of  generations of African-Americans who suffered slavery and then  racial segregation policies that made them second-class  citizens.      He assumes the mantle of power at a moment of great anxiety  among Americans who have seen hundreds of thousands of jobs  vanish in past months and left them fearful an economic  collapse could turn a crisis into a catastrophe.      The 'Obama-mania' that helped propel Obama into office was  alive on the streets of Washington.      A winter chill failed to dampen the spirits of more than 1  million people who swept into the U.S. capital to witness the  pomp and ceremony and revel in the festivities surrounding  Obama's inauguration as the 44th U.S. president.      'Slavery to History, The Obama Inauguration,' was the  slogan on a handwritten cardboard sign held by a smiling man on  a downtown sidewalk.      Thousands of security personnel were in place to maintain  order and guard against an attack. Much of the city center was  barricaded and shut down to vehicular traffic.      In an eagerly anticipated inauguration address he has been  working on for weeks, Obama will rally Americans to an era of  responsibility, urging them to join in a spirit of unity to  take on difficult issues.      'Government can only do so much,' he told participants in a  service project honoring slain civil rights leader Martin  Luther King Jr. on Monday. 'We're going to have to take  responsibility -- all of us.'      Obama in recent days has stressed that Americans should  expect even rougher economic times and that his plan to revive  the struggling economy will take time to work.           OBAMA HONORS MCCAIN, COLIN POWELL      The president-to-be appeared in a giddy mood on Monday  night as he spent the evening at dinners honoring former  Republican rival John McCain, former Secretary of State Colin  Powell and Vice President-elect Joe Biden.      At the event for McCain, he could not resist referring to  the sometimes testy campaign debates in which they took part.      'I'm here tonight to say a few words about an American hero  I have come to know very well and admire very much -- Senator  John McCain. And then, according to the rules agreed to by both  parties, John will have approximately 30 seconds to make a  rebuttal,' he said.      Crowds of people clapped as Obama's motorcade sped through  the city en route to the various dinners.      Favorable winds were blowing at Obama's back despite the  long to-do list he inherits from President George W. Bush. A  realclearpolitics.com average of recent polls showed a  remarkable 73 percent of Americans had a favorable view of  Obama.      By contrast, Bush leaves with sagging poll numbers, weighed  down by wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the worst ",

      "Text": "    Jan 20 (Reuters) - Barack Obama will be sworn in as the  44th president of the United States at noon on Tuesday.      Here are some biographical facts about the first  African-American to hold the nation's highest office.        Age: 47      Birthdate: Aug. 4, 1961      Birthplace: Honolulu, Hawaii      Education: Columbia University; Harvard Law School      Wife: Michelle Robinson Obama      Children: Daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7      Religious affiliation: United Church of Christ      Party: Democrat        Family: Barack Obama was born to a Kenyan father and a  white American mother. His father, Barack Obama Sr., married  his mother, Ann Dunham, while studying at the University of  Hawaii. The couple separated two years after Obama was born.  His father ultimately returned to Kenya, where he became a  noted economist. He died in a car accident in 1982.      Obama's mother's second marriage was to an Indonesian man  named Lolo Soetoro. The family moved to Indonesia and Obama  remained there until he was 10 when he moved back to Hawaii and  lived with his grandparents while studying on a scholarship at  the elite Punahou Academy.      He has seven half brothers and sisters in Kenya from his  father's other marriages, and a half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng,  from his mother's second marriage.        Career: After finishing college in 1983, Obama worked for a  New York financial consultancy and a consumer organization. He  landed a job in Chicago in 1985 as an organizer for Developing  Communities Project, a church-based group seeking to improve  living conditions in poor neighborhoods.      Three years later, Obama left to go to Harvard Law School,  where he became the first black president of the law review. He  worked as a summer associate at the Sidley Austin law firm in  Chicago, where he met his future wife. After graduation from  Harvard in 1991, Obama practiced civil rights law at a small  firm in Chicago, then became a lecturer in constitutional law  at the University of Chicago in 1993.        Elective office: Obama won a seat in the Illinois state  Senate in 1996. During his time in the Legislature, he worked  on welfare and ethics legislation, as well as a measure  requiring electronic recording of police interrogations and  confessions in homicide investigations.      Obama won a heavily contested U.S. Senate seat in 2004,  carrying 53 percent of the Democratic primary vote in an  eight-candidate race. He easily won the general election as  well. In the U.S. Senate he compiled a liberal voting record,  but was one of the few Democrats to back a measure on  class-action lawsuits. He opposed the appointment of Chief  Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito to the U.S.  Supreme Court.      The nonpartisan National Journal ranked him as the most  liberal member of the U.S. Senate early this year based on his  voting record in 2007. He was ranked 10th most liberal in 2006  and 16th most liberal in 2005.           Presidential campaign: Obama announced his presidential  candidacy on Feb. 10, 2007. Though New York Sen. Hillary  Clinton was initially seen as the front-runner for the  Democratic nomination, Obama quickly showed an ability to raise  large amounts of money and draw record-breaking crowds who were  attracted to his rhetorical skill, his opposition to the Iraq  war, and his promise to move beyond the divisive politics of  the past 40 years.      Obama won the first contest of the Democratic primary in  Iowa in",

      "Text": "    By Ellen Wulfhorst      PHILADELPHIA, April 16 (Reuters) - Rock superstar Bruce  Springsteen on Wednesday endorsed Democratic Sen. Barack Obama  for U.S. president, saying he stands 'head and shoulders above  the rest.'      In a message posted on his Web site, the musician and  songwriter known as the Boss said the Illinois senator has 'the  depth, the reflectiveness and the resilience' to be the next  U.S. president.      'Like most of you, I've been following the campaign and I  have now seen and heard enough to know where I stand. Sen.  Obama, in my view, is head and shoulders above the rest,' he  wrote.      Many of Springsteen's rousing rock anthems and haunting  ballads celebrate working class Americans. His endorsement in  the November presidential election comes as Obama fends off  charges he is out of touch with working class voters.      The Obama campaign welcomed the endorsement. The America of  Springsteen's songs -- with its hardworking people and big  dreams -- is 'a story I know and a vision I share for our  future, and that's why I'm so honored to have his support in  this journey,' Obama said in a statement.

      "Text": "(Refile to update headline)      Nov 5 (Reuters) - Barack Obama is the U.S. president-elect.  Following are some of his biographical details:        Age: 47      Birthdate: Aug. 4, 1961      Birthplace: Honolulu, Hawaii      Education: Columbia University; Harvard Law School      Wife: Michelle Robinson      Children: Two daughters      Religious affiliation: United Church of Christ        Family: Barack Obama was born in Hawaii to a Kenyan father  and a white American mother. His father, Barack Obama Sr.,  married his mother, Ann Dunham, while studying at the  University of Hawaii. The couple separated two years after  Obama was born. His father ultimately returned to Kenya, where  he became a noted economist. He died in a car accident in 1982.      Obama's mother's second marriage was to an Indonesian man  named Lolo Soetoro. The family moved to Indonesia and Obama  remained there until he was 10 when he moved back to Hawaii and  lived with his grandparents while studying on a scholarship at  the elite Punahou Academy.      He has seven half brothers and sisters in Kenya from his  father's other marriages, and a half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng,  from his mother's second marriage.        Career: After finishing college in 1983, Obama worked for a  New York financial consultant and a consumer organization. He  landed a job in Chicago in 1985 as an organizer for Developing  Communities Project, a church-based group seeking to improve  living conditions in poor neighborhoods.      Three years later, Obama left to go to Harvard Law School,  where he became the first black president of the law review. He  worked as a summer associate at the Sidley Austin law firm in  Chicago, where he met his future wife. After graduation from  Harvard in 1991, Obama practiced civil rights law at a small  firm in Chicago, then became a lecturer in constitutional law  at the University of Chicago in 1993.        Elective office: Obama won a seat in the Illinois state  Senate in 1996. During his time in the legislature, he worked  on welfare and ethics legislation, as well as a measure  requiring electronic recording of police interrogations and  confessions in homicide investigations.      Obama won a heavily contested U.S. Senate seat in 2004,  carrying 53 percent of the Democratic primary vote in an  eight-candidate race. He easily won the general election. In  the Senate he compiled a liberal voting record, but was one of  the few Democrats to back a measure on class-action lawsuits.  He opposed the appointment of Chief Justice John Roberts and  Justice Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court.      The nonpartisan National Journal ranked him as the most  liberal member of the Senate early this year based on his  voting record in 2007. He was ranked 10th most liberal in 2006  and 16th most liberal in 2005.

'Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real,'  Obama said in his inaugural speech shortly after taking the  oath of office. 'They are serious and they are many. They will  not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this,  America -- they will be met.'      Hundreds of thousands of people erupted in roars of  approval on the broad National Mall grounds as they watched  Obama stand with one hand raised, one hand on a Bible used to  swear in Abraham Lincoln in 1861, and repeat the brief oath to  become the 44th U.S. president and succeed George W. Bush.      The inauguration of Obama, 47, the son of a black Kenyan  father and a white mother from Kansas, was steeped in symbolic  meaning for African-Americans, who for generations suffered  slavery and then racial segregation that made them second-class  citizens.      Beaming broadly, the new president had kisses for his wife,  Michelle, and his school-age daughters, Malia and Sasha, then  he turned to the crowds stretching away into the distance on a  cold, wintry day.      'Obama, Obama,' the crowd cheered.       Dispatching quickly with pleasantries, Obama turned to the  task at hand and sought to temper the soaring optimism about  his leadership with reality. A Democrat, he took over from  Republican Bush, who served two terms and whose approval  ratings plumbed record lows.      Obama cited the worst U.S. economic conditions in 70 years  and U.S. involvement in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as having  placed the country 'in the midst of crisis.'      'On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over  fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord,' he said.      He pledged bold and swift action on the 'badly weakened'  U.S. economy, a top priority as he works with the U.S. Congress  on an estimated $850 billion economic stimulus package aimed at  jolting the economy back to life.      U.S. stock indexes extended losses and hit session lows  after his speech, which provided few details on how to tackle  the crisis.[ID:nN20414587]             VOWS 'NEW WAY FORWARD' WITH MUSLIMS      After years of tense relations with Muslims following the  Sept. 11 attacks seven years ago that prompted Washington's  declared war on terrorism and deeply shaped Bush's policies,  Obama offered conciliatory words to the Islamic community while  issuing a warning to those who would wage terrorism.      In a message to the Muslim world, Obama said he would seek  a 'new way forward' based on mutual interest and mutual  respect.      He added: 'We will not apologize for our way of life, nor  will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance  their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we  say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be  broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.'      In his first act of business, the Obama White House issued  a proclamation declaring a national day of renewal and  reconciliation and calling on Americans to serve one another.

      "Text": "    WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Jimmy  Carter, one of a handful of high-profile Democrats who has  remained neutral in his party's presidential primary battle,  has hinted that he supports Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton,  according to news reports on Friday.      Traveling in Nigeria, Carter said his home state of Georgia  and his hometown of Plains backed Obama in the state's Feb. 5  primary. His children, their spouses and his grandchildren  support Obama as well, he said.      'As a superdelegate, I would not disclose who I am rooting  for but I leave it to you to make that guess,' ABC News quoted  Carter as saying.      Democratic party rules allow elected officials and party  insiders, termed 'superdelegates,' to back whom they want at  the party's nominating convention.      Those who remain unaligned are being urgently courted by  both campaigns, as they could mean the difference between  victory and defeat in the hard-fought battle to win the party's  nomination and take on presumptive Republican nominee John  McCain in the November election.      Neither Obama, an Illinois senator who would be the first  black president, nor Clinton, a New York senator who would be  the first woman president, is likely to clinch the nomination  through the state-by-state primaries and caucuses that continue  through June.      Other prominent superdelegates who remain uncommitted  include U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and  former Vice President Al Gore, the 2000 Democratic presidential  nominee.

      "Text": "    By Jeff Mason      CHICAGO, Nov 25 (Reuters) - There may be only one U.S.  president at a time, but you wouldn't know it by watching  Barack Obama this week.      The Democratic president-elect, who kept a low profile for  three weeks after his White House win, has swung into action  with a series of economic pronouncements and cabinet selections  that have overshadowed President George W. Bush.      If financial markets are clamoring for more leadership,  Obama got the message.      'There is a leadership vacuum. If Obama doesn't fill it,  more panic will result in (the) short run, and the problem will  become greater by the time he officially takes office,' said  Stephen Wayne, professor of government at Georgetown  University.      'It is still Bush's power to act now, but Obama's  obligation to tell jittery Americans what he plans to do.'      On Monday Obama held a news conference to announce his  economic team. Flanked by flags and new staff members, he vowed  to jolt the economy with an aggressive new stimulus package.      On Tuesday Obama held another press event, this time  announcing his pick to run the White House budget office and  intention to cut billions of dollars in wasteful spending.      Both days he took questions from reporters while his  heavyweight appointments -- including New York Federal Reserve  Chairman President Timothy Geithner as Treasury secretary --  stood behind him, silent. He has another news conference  scheduled for Wednesday.      Meanwhile, back in Washington, Bush had coffee with his  Treasury secretary, told reporters he was keeping his successor  apprised of steps to secure the financial system, and took a  trip to visit troops in Kentucky.      On the pressing issue of the day -- the economy -- the man  who will be the next president of the United States very much  upstaged the current White House occupant, prompting a question  on Tuesday about his oft-stated pronouncement that the country  only had one head of state at a time.      'Well, there is only one president at a time. That  president is George W. Bush, and he will be president until I'm  sworn in on January 20th,' Obama said, when asked how he  squared his involvement in the economy with that fact.      '(But) I think it is very important for the American people  to understand that we are putting together a first-class team  and for them to have clarity that we don't intend to stumble  into the next administration.'           LEADERSHIP VACUUM      No stumbling so far. Obama has drawn accolades for his  appointments, though his refusal to give his stimulus package a  price tag caused U.S. stocks to pare gains briefly on Monday.      Paul Beck, a professor of political science at Ohio State  University, said the current transition recalled the situation  in 1932 when Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt took over from  Republican Herbert Hoover in the midst of an economic  disaster.      'It is not normal that a president-elect would get involved  in this way, but these are not normal times,' he said, adding  that Bush's credibility had eroded to the point that he was not  taken seriously within the financial markets.      'The economy will not wait for the transition to be  completed. That was a problem in 1932, and subsequently we  moved the presidential inauguration from March to January.   Now, we are finding out that January is not early enough.'      Obama takes over from Bush on Jan. 20. He has urged the  next U.S. Congress",

Kennedy collapses at luncheon           (Refiles to fix typos in paragraph 3)      By Steve Holland and Caren Bohan      WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Barack Obama took power as  the first black U.S. president on Tuesday and quickly turned  the page on the Bush years, urging Americans to rally to end  the worst economic crisis in 70 years and repair the U.S. image  abroad.      'Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves  off, and begin again the work of remaking America,' Obama said,  addressing an exuberant sea of people in an inaugural speech  that was both optimistic but realistic about the challenges  ahead.      He pledged bold and swift action to bring new life to the  U.S. economy and declared to millions watching abroad that, 'We  are ready to lead once more.'      But illustrating the tough road ahead, Wall Street ushered  in the new presidency with the record Inauguration Day slide  amid signs the global banking crisis was far from over.  [ID:nN20429093]      Hundreds of thousands of people erupted in roars of  approval on Washington's broad National Mall grounds as they  watched Obama stand with one hand raised, one hand on a Bible  used to swear in Abraham Lincoln in 1861, and repeat the brief  oath to become the 44th U.S. president.      Beaming, the new president kissed his wife, Michelle, and  his school-age daughters, Malia and Sasha. Then he turned to  the crowds stretching into the distance on a cold, wintry day.      'Obama, Obama,' the crowd cheered.      Obama, a Democrat, replaced Republican George W. Bush, who  served two terms and left office having plumbed record lows in  approval ratings and leaving a legacy of two wars and an  economy in recession.           WALKING SOME OF THE WAY      During a triumphant ride down Pennsylvania Avenue to the  White House in a heavily armored limousine, Obama and his wife  thrilled wildly cheering crowds by getting out of the limo and  walking a part of the way on foot.      Security personnel -- part of a contingent that numbered in  the thousands -- kept close watch.      Obama has to hit the ground running given the state of the  economy and the U.S. Senate confirmed several key Obama  appointments, including Steven Chu as energy secretary and Tom  Vilsack for agriculture. The Senate Finance Committee is  expected to vote on Timothy Geithner as treasury secretary on  Thursday.      The inauguration of Obama, 47, the son of a black Kenyan  father and a white mother from Kansas, was steeped in symbolism  for African-Americans, who for generations suffered slavery and  then racial segregation that made them second-class citizens.      In a nod to that history, Obama lauded the people who built  the country from its foundation, including those who 'endured  the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.'      The jubilant mood was jolted by the collapse of  Massachusetts Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy at an inaugural  lunch honoring Obama on Capitol Hill. Kennedy, 76, who  underwent surgery in June for a brain tumor, appeared to suffer  convulsions, a congressional aide said.      Wheeled out on a stretcher, the respected brother of the  late President John F. Kennedy was driven away by an ambulance  to a hospital, where he was described as awake and answering  questions.

      "Text": " (Updates with Obama win in South Carolina)      By John Whitesides, Political Correspondent      COLUMBIA, S.C., Jan 26 (Reuters) - Barack Obama won a vital  contest in South Carolina on Saturday in his quest for the U.S.  Democratic presidential nomination, showing strength among  southern blacks who make up half the state's Democratic  voters.      After losses in New Hampshire and Nevada, the victory gave  Obama, who would be the first black president, a big lift  heading into the Super Tuesday contests on Feb. 5, when nearly  half of the U.S. states will pick Republican and Democratic  candidates for the November election.      South Carolina was the latest test for Obama, who would be  the first black U.S president, and Clinton, a New York senator,  in their escalating battle for the right to represent the  Democratic Party in November's presidential election.      After two consecutive losses, in New Hampshire and Nevada,  Obama needed a win on Saturday if he hopes to head into the  Feb. 5 'Super Tuesday' contests in two dozen states with a  realistic chance of victory.      The high stakes fueled a week of angry accusations, harsh  advertisements and increasingly personal jabs between the two  candidates, capped by a volley of attacks on Obama from  Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton.      Obama and Hillary Clinton visited with voters in South  Carolina during the day -- Obama visited a polling station and  a restaurant, while Clinton visited two restaurants.      Clinton left South Carolina before the polls closed, headed  to Tennessee -- which votes on Feb. 5 -- for a town hall  meeting in Nashville.      The other candidate in the Democratic race, former North  Carolina Sen. John Edwards, who won South Carolina during his  failed 2004 presidential bid, was in a battle with Clinton for  second place.

      "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Democrat Barack Obama won the  endorsement of The Washington Post in an editorial saying the  Illinois senator 'has the potential to become a great  president.'      The newspaper said its choice was made easy in part by the  'disappointing campaign' of Republican candidate John McCain and  his decision to pick Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, as his  vice presidential running mate for the Nov. 4 election.      'It is made easy in larger part, though, because of our  admiration for Mr. Obama and the impressive qualities he has  shown during this long race,' the Post said in the editorial for  its Friday editions published on its website on Thursday night.      The paper, which endorsed Democrats in the two previous  presidential elections, praised Obama as a 'man of supple  intelligence, with a nuanced grasp of complex issues and evident  skill at conciliation and consensus-building.'      It said Obama also has a sophisticated understanding of the  world and America's place in it and that he was committed to  maintaining U.S. leadership.      In endorsing Obama, the Post said a McCain presidency would  not equal four more years of Bush administration policies. But  the paper said McCain would draw on many of the same policymakers  who have brought the country to its current state.      'We believe they have richly earned, and might even benefit  from, some years in the political wilderness,' the editorial  said.

      "Text": "(Repeats with no change in content)      By Jeff Mason      CHICAGO, Nov 26 (Reuters) - There may be only one U.S.  president at a time, but you wouldn't know it by watching  Barack Obama this week.      The Democratic president-elect, who kept a low profile for  three weeks after his White House win, has swung into action  with a series of economic pronouncements and cabinet selections  that have overshadowed President George W. Bush.      If financial markets are clamoring for more leadership,  Obama got the message.      'There is a leadership vacuum. If Obama doesn't fill it,  more panic will result in (the) short run, and the problem will  become greater by the time he officially takes office,' said  Stephen Wayne, professor of government at Georgetown  University.      'It is still Bush's power to act now, but Obama's  obligation to tell jittery Americans what he plans to do.'      On Monday Obama held a news conference to announce his  economic team. Flanked by flags and new staff members, he vowed  to jolt the economy with an aggressive new stimulus package.      On Tuesday Obama held another press event, this time  announcing his pick to run the White House budget office and  intention to cut billions of dollars in wasteful spending.      Both days he took questions from reporters while his  heavyweight appointments -- including New York Federal Reserve  Chairman President Timothy Geithner as Treasury secretary --  stood behind him, silent. He has another news conference  scheduled for Wednesday.      Meanwhile, back in Washington, Bush had coffee with his  Treasury secretary, told reporters he was keeping his successor  apprised of steps to secure the financial system, and took a  trip to visit troops in Kentucky.      On the pressing issue of the day -- the economy -- the man  who will be the next president of the United States very much  upstaged the current White House occupant, prompting a question  on Tuesday about his oft-stated pronouncement that the country  only had one head of state at a time.      'Well, there is only one president at a time. That  president is George W. Bush, and he will be president until I'm  sworn in on January 20th,' Obama said, when asked how he  squared his involvement in the economy with that fact.      '(But) I think it is very important for the American people  to understand that we are putting together a first-class team  and for them to have clarity that we don't intend to stumble  into the next administration.'           LEADERSHIP VACUUM      No stumbling so far. Obama has drawn accolades for his  appointments, though his refusal to give his stimulus package a  price tag caused U.S. stocks to pare gains briefly on Monday.      Paul Beck, a professor of political science at Ohio State  University, said the current transition recalled the situation  in 1932 when Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt took over from  Republican Herbert Hoover in the midst of an economic  disaster.      'It is not normal that a president-elect would get involved  in this way, but these are not normal times,' he said, adding  that Bush's credibility had eroded to the point that he was not  taken seriously within the financial markets.      'The economy will not wait for the transition to be  completed. That was a problem in 1932, and subsequently we  moved the presidential inauguration from March to January.   Now, we are finding out that January is not early enough.'      Obama takes over from Bush on Jan. 20.",

'Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real,'  Obama said in his inaugural speech shortly after taking the  oath of office. 'They are serious and they are many. They will  not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this,  America -- they will be met.'      Hundreds of thousands of people erupted in roars of  approval on the broad National Mall grounds as they watched  Obama stand with one hand raised, one hand on a Bible used to  swear in Abraham Lincoln in 1861, and repeat the brief oath to  become the 44th U.S. president and succeed George W. Bush.      Turning to crowds stretching way into the distance, Obama  cited the worst economic conditions in 70 years and U.S.  involvement in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as having placed  the country 'in the midst of crisis.'      'On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over  fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord,' he said.           PROMISE OF BOLD, SWIFT ACTION      Obama pledged bold and swift action on the 'badly weakened'  U.S. economy, a top priority as he works with the U.S. Congress  on an estimated $850 billion economic stimulus package aimed at  jolting the economy back to life.      On Iraq, Obama vowed the United States would begin to leave  responsibly but cited no specific timetable.      He offered conciliatory words to Muslims while issuing a  warning to those who would wage terrorism. In a message to the  Muslim world, Obama said he would seek a 'new way forward'  based on mutual interest and mutual respect.      He also said: 'We will not apologize for our way of life,  nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to  advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering  innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and  cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat  you.'      Obama said the economic crisis was a consequence of 'greed  and irresponsibility' on the part of some and vowed that those  who manage Americans' money 'will be held to account.'      He also promised a 'watchful eye' to ensure financial  markets do not spin out of control.

Obama, 47, the son of a black Kenyan father and a white  mother from Kansas, was to take the oath of office at noon  (1700 GMT) on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, his hand placed on  a Bible used by Abraham Lincoln at his first inauguration in  1861.      His inauguration as the 44th president caps hopes and  dreams of, among others, generations of African-Americans who  suffered slavery and then racial segregation that made them  second-class citizens.      Crowds of people bundled up against the freezing  temperatures streamed before dawn toward the inauguration site  and the national mall, a long grassy park that stretches from  the Capitol Building in central Washington.      More than 1 million people were expected to fill the Mall  to be as close as possible to the event and watch it on huge  television screens.      Traffic backed up at parking lots at metro rail stops and  even at 5 a.m. trains were packed. Some die-hards camped out to  be the first through security checkpoints, where crowds quickly  built up.       Overnight, the capital buzzed with 'Obama-mania,' with  well-wishers, many in tuxedos and formal gowns, attending  formal balls in a run-up to a bigger round of inaugural bashes  Tuesday.      No president has begun his four-year term in office with as  much public confidence -- a 78 percent approval rating in the  most recent Gallup poll -- and a sharp contrast with outgoing  President George W. Bush, whose ratings plumbed record lows,  weighed down by unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the  worst economic problems since the Great Depression.        TIGHT SECURITY      Thousands of security personnel were in place to maintain  order and guard against any attempt to disrupt the  inauguration. Much of the city center was barricaded and shut  to private cars.      'Slavery to History, The Obama Inauguration,' was the  slogan on a handwritten cardboard sign held by a smiling man on  a downtown sidewalk.      In an eagerly anticipated inauguration address he has been  working on for weeks, Obama will rally Americans to an era of  responsibility, urging them to join in a spirit of unity to  take on difficult issues.      'Government can only do so much,' he told participants in a  service project honoring slain civil rights leader Martin  Luther King Jr. on Monday. 'We're going to have to take  responsibility -- all of us.'      Obama in recent days has stressed that Americans should  expect even rougher economic times and that his plan to revive  the struggling economy will take time to work.      The president-to-be appeared in a giddy mood on Monday  night as he spent the evening at dinners honoring former  Republican rival John McCain, former Secretary of State Colin  Powell and Vice President-elect Joe Biden.      At the event for McCain, he could not resist referring to  the sometimes testy campaign debates in which they took part.      'I'm here tonight to say a few words about an American hero  I have come to know",

      "Text": "    SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 19 (Reuters) - California Attorney  General Jerry Brown unexpectedly joined the fight to reverse a  ban on gay marriage, telling the state Supreme Court on Friday  the voter-approved ban violates the constitutional right to  liberty.      Proposition 8, which limits marriage to a union of man and  woman, was approved by California voters last month. It stopped  same-sex marriages and sparked a legal battle that has reached  the state's top court.      The same court opened the door to gay marriage in a ruling  over the summer, putting California among a handful of states,  provinces and countries where it is legal.      'The amendment process cannot be used to extinguish  fundamental constitutional rights without compelling  justification,' Brown, a former California governor, said in a  statement accompanying a brief to the court.      Brown had not previously disclosed his opinion on the  constitutionality of Prop 8.

      "Text": "    By Jill Serjeant      LOS ANGELES, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Hollywood, long considered a  bastion of liberal thinking, is being chided for not opening  its wallet to save the right to same-sex marriage in California  even as several A-list gays and lesbians rush to the altar.      With a month to go before a Nov. 4 referendum seeking to  abolish the newly won right of same-sex couples to marry in  California, some in the entertainment community are anxious  that more of their own are not supporting gay rights by  donating money to defeat the proposed ban.      So far, the largest celebrity donations have come from  actor Brad Pitt and director Steven Spielberg who each  contributed $100,000 each last month to help defeat the ballot  proposal, known as Proposition 8.      'We are concerned that the entertainment industry hasn't  stepped up to the plate to fight this unnecessary initiative  ... Now it's time for the entertainment industry as a whole to  take the lead,' activist Jonathan Lewis said on Wednesday.      Lewis, an entrepreneur from Ohio, said his family would  match the next $500,000 that entertainment industry leaders  contribute to the 'No on Prop 8' campaign.      Hundreds of gays and lesbians have married since a May  decision by the California Supreme Court overturning a state  ban on same-sex marriage.      But opponents of the ruling put the issue up for a  state-wide referendum that seeks to amend the California  constitution to allow marriage only between a man and a woman.      Recent opinion polls show that 38 percent of California  voters would support a ban on same-sex marriage with 55 percent  opposed. But supporters of the ban, including several religious  and conservative groups, have edged ahead in fund-raising.        CELEBRITY SIDE EFFECTS      By late September, opponents of gay marriage had raised  $14.7 million, while supporters brought in $13.5 million,  according the official records.      An article in the Los Angeles gay magazine In-LA last month  headlined 'Mega A-Gays Missing in Fight Against Prop 8' noted  that state records show Ellen DeGeneres, Portia de Rossi,  Melissa Etheridge, Rosie O'Donnell and international gays such  as Elton John have not contributed any cash.      But many in Hollywood also argue that the high-profile  wedding of popular chat show host DeGeneres to actress de Rossi  in August brought the kind of publicity money cannot buy.      DeGeneres, who in 1997 became the first openly gay lead  character on U.S. prime-time network TV, also has used her talk  show and an appearance on 'The Tonight Show with Jay Leno' to  urge Californians to maintain same-sex marriage.       Still, says Steve Smith, a consultant for the 'No on Prop  8' campaign, money is important.      'California is a very expensive state to communicate with  voters. Celebrity money in some ways goes a little further. It  gets more reported and that adds to the benefit of the  contribution itself,' Smith said.      'My guess is that after Pitt and Spielberg's donations we  are going to see more of that money,' Smith added.      To bolster its funds, the 'No on Prop 8' campaign will hold  an entertainment industry fundraiser this month.      However, celebrity giving can backfire.      'On word that Brad Pitt had donated $100,000 to the No  campaign, we had an individual who read that and himself  donated $100,000 to us,' said Jennifer Kearns, spokeswoman for  the 'Yes on Prop 8' campaign. 'So sometimes the high-prof",

      "Text": "    By Peter Henderson      LOS ANGELES, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Gay couples are not hiding  any more and that has made all the difference, said health care  administrator Linda Merkens before Tuesday's vote in California  that will decide the legality of same-sex marriage there.      It's one of several important ballot measures voters will  face in states across the country on Election Day.      'A lot more gays are more open about their relationships,  and a lot more people are willing to accept it,' Merkens said  in downtown Los Angeles recently.      Other passersby disagreed. 'Same sex marriage is a sin,'  said city planner Kim Chan.      Tuesday's results will show how far attitudes to gay  marriage have changed. Florida and Arizona will join California  in voting on whether to stop gay marriage.      In the past, such propositions have almost always been  approved, but polls show a close finish in California and many  undecided in all three states.      Legal abortion also faces a key challenge as South Dakotans  consider a measure to severely restrict the procedure. If it  passes, opponents are expected to challenge it all the way to  the U.S. Supreme Court. A poll by the state Argus Leader  newspaper showed that vote a toss-up.      Altogether, 150 measures in about 35 states will be put to  the vote on the same day the next U.S. president is chosen,  with other issues ranging from affirmative action to how farm  animals are treated. [ID:nN01396494].      A California court in May rejected limiting marriage to a  man and a woman. Only a few nations and states agree.      Now Hollywood stars like Brad Pitt are facing off with  conservative foes like the fast-growing Mormon church, the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, over Proposition  8, which would ban same-sex marriage.      Both sides have broad, deep pockets: ban proponents have  raised about $30 million, and opponents recently topped that.           MORE IMPORTANT THAN PRESIDENCY      'This is the most important thing on the November 4th  ballot,' said Tony Perkins, president of the conservative  Family Research Council. 'We've made bad selections as  presidents but survived as a nation. But if we move down the  path towards the dissolution of marriage we cannot divorce  ourselves from the consequences of that.'      Episcopal Bishop Marc Andrus supports gay marriage and said  a ballot loss would slow the process -- not stop it.      Californians in 2000 passed a measure to define marriage as  between a man and a woman. At that time, the San Francisco Bay  Area was the only part of the state that supported gay  marriage, said pollster Mark DiCamillo of the Field Poll.      This year, all the coastal areas support gay marriage, and  support in the inland valleys, which have values similar to the  center of the United States, has grown but remains small.      Los Angeles County had the biggest swing, he said. 'It's  the moderates who have moved,' he said.      John Matsusaka, president of the Initiative and Referendum  Institute at the University of Southern California, said  voters, especially younger ones, were used to homosexuality.     'It doesn't have shock value any more,' Matsusaka said.      A ProtectMarriage.org flyer argues that gay marriage will  be taught in schools if the ban fails, a position their  opponents reject. Same-sex marriage supporters focus on equal  rights for all. 'People you know are asking you to vote no on  Prop. 8' a No on 8 flyer says. ",

      "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Comedian Ellen DeGeneres  has bought $100,000 of television airtime to urge Californians  to vote to save the right to gay marriage in a November ballot,  campaign organizers said on Friday.      Claiming that opponents of gay marriage are twisting the  truth and trying to scare voters, DeGeneres will appeal in a  television ad to vote for equality, compassion and fairness.      The chat show host and comic actress wed her long time  partner, actress Portia de Rossi, in August in the most  high-profile same-sex marriage since such unions were declared  legal in California in May.      Her message will be broadcast on television as celebrities  step up the fight to defeat Proposition 8 on the Nov.4 state  ballot that seeks to define marriage under the California  constitution as only between a man and a woman.      'Hi, I'm Ellen DeGeneres.  I got to do something this year  I never thought I'd ever be able to do: I got married. It was  the happiest day of my life. There are people out there raising  millions of dollars to try and take that right away from me.      'You've seen their ads on TV. They're twisting the truth,  and they're trying to scare you. I believe in fairness.  I  believe in compassion. I believe in equality for all people.  Proposition 8 does not. Please, please, vote no on Prop. 8,'  the actress says in her appeal.      In recent weeks, opinion polls have shown a swing in the  number of Californians who oppose same-sex marriage.

      "Text": "    By Edith Honan      NEW YORK, Nov 26  (Reuters) - New York is close to becoming  the first U.S. state to pass legislation making gay marriage  legal but, like many political issues in the state capital  Albany, it has fallen victim to a power struggle.      Democrats won a majority in the upper house Senate for the  first time in more than 40 years in the Nov. 4 election, but  three Democratic senators refuse to back fellow Democratic Sen.  Malcolm Smith as majority leader without concessions.      The Republicans could regain their power in the Senate if  the three Democratic senators, who include longtime gay  marriage opponent Sen. Ruben Diaz, opt to vote with them.      'I will not give my vote to a leader that will bring gay  marriage to the state,' Diaz, a Pentecostal minister, said in  an interview. 'Have a voter referendum. Let the people  decide.'      Connecticut and Massachusetts are the only U.S. states that  allow same-sex marriage as a result of court rulings. No state  legislature has instituted gay marriage into law.      After Californian voters passed Prop 8 on Nov. 4 reversing  the state's Supreme Court decision in May to allow same-sex  marriage, the next battleground state for gay mariage is  expected to be New York. The New York Assembly passed a  marriage bill in June 2007 but the Senate has yet to act.      The Senate power struggle has delayed appointment of a  majority leader until January and upset gay rights activists  who believed gay marriage would be legalized once Democrats  took control of the Senate.      Albany has a reputation for bickering and power struggles,  which critics say was demonstrated when the legislature last  week rejected Democratic Gov. David Paterson's emergency budget  cuts for many reasons, including the Senate leadership battle.      Gay marriage has broad support in the Democratic-controlled  lower house, the State Assembly, where it passed in a vote of  85 to 61 last year. It was never put to a vote in the upper  house when the Republicans controlled the Senate.      Paterson, who in May ordered all state agencies to  recognize out-of-state gay marriages, has said he would sign  such a bill into law.      'It's going to happen. It's not an if, it's a when,' said  Sen. Tom Duane, a same-sex marriage campaigner.      Gay rights groups say they are still hopeful New York and  New Jersey legislatures will pass gay marriage bills as soon as  2009 and are unfazed by the New York State Senate leadership  struggle.      'When the dust settles, and we do consider it dust, there  will be a Democratic majority leader who will put forth a  marriage equality bill,' said Marty Rouse, national field  director for Human Rights Campaign, a major U.S. gay rights  group.      Alan Van Capelle, executive director of Empire State Pride  Agenda, said the gay marriage issue had not proven to be toxic  as none of the Republican assembly members who voted for  same-sex marriage in 2007 were voted out of office.      But Duane Motley, executive director of the Christian lobby  group New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms, said that even  if Smith is named majority leader, passage of gay marriage is  by no means assured.      'It's not a done deal,' he said. 'The rank and file people  of New York State are not in favor of homosexual marriages.'      Smith has not said publicly how he will handle the gay  marriage issue if he is made majority leader at the next  legislative session in January.      'Re",

      "Text": "    By Peter Henderson      SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The legal battle over gay  marriage in California turned on Monday to whether the state's  top court could strike down a change in the state constitution  that was approved by voters.      Gay marriage opponents said overturning a same-sex marriage  ban would change the nature of California government by gutting  the people's right to make law.      Giving such power to the court would create 'a sweeping  power vested in the least-democratic branch that overrides the  precious right of the people to determine how they will be  governed,' they said in court papers filed on Monday.      'It is essentially changing the constitution-making  function from the people to the courts,' lawyer Andrew Pugno, a  supporter of Proposition 8, which defines marriage as between a  man and a woman, said by telephone.      Gay marriage proponents, led by California Attorney General  Jerry Brown, argue that the right to marry is part of the  'inalienable right' to liberty, so the state Supreme Court must  strike down even an amendment to the constitution limiting it.      State voters approved Prop 8 on Nov. 4, removing California  from the short list of U.S. states, Canadian provinces and  mostly European countries allowing same-sex unions.      The vote in California, which had begun allowing gay  marriage only months earlier, sparked protests across the  United States, even though a solid majority of states have  outlawed same-sex marriage.      California often sets socially liberal precedents for the  rest of the United States, but many of its residents have a  fundamentalist democratic, anti-government bent. Citizens have  wide latitude to change laws and the state constitution  directly via popular vote -- which was the case with the gay  marriage ban.      The ban was approved by 52 percent of voters. Brown says  that, unless there is a compelling societal need, the court  must safeguard liberty first and foremost. Lawyers backing the  ban, he said, want 'to say that a fundamental liberty is only  fundamental until 52 percent of the people say otherwise.'      The court, which in a summer 2008 opinion opened the door  to same-sex marriage -- until the ban was passed in November --  is expected to hear oral arguments in March.

      "Text": " (Adds quotes from lawyers, advocates)      By Peter Henderson      SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 19 (Reuters) - California's Supreme  Court on Wednesday agreed to hear a legal challenge against the  state's voter-approved ban on gay marriage and let the ban  stand in the meantime.      A decision by the same court in May had opened marriage to  same-sex couples in America's most populous state, one of a  handful of states, provinces and mostly European countries  where such unions are recognized.      When state voters passed the ban on Nov. 4, social  conservatives celebrated, but nationwide protests by gays and  other ban opponents since then have given the debate new life.      The court case also pits two fundamental concepts of U.S.  democracy against one another, with gay marriage advocates  saying the proposition would open the doors to systematic  repression of minorities and opponents saying courts must  recognize the will of the people under separation of powers  doctrine.      'I am optimistic that the Supreme Court will affirm that  separate is not equal,' San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom said  in a statement. 'This is a great day for the rule of law and  the voters of California,' said Andrew Pugno, counsel for the  gay marriage ban proponents.      Trend-setting California is itself divided over the issue,  with cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles more open to gay  marriage and inland valleys, often compared to the socially  conservative Midwest, against it.      Thousands of same-sex marriages may also hang in the  balance, since the court asked for arguments on whether the  ban, Proposition 8, would affect unions between the May court  ruling and the November election.        LEGAL LIMBO      Those marriages have been seen as being in legal limbo,  despite state officials including Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger  saying they should stand.      Gay marriage advocates as well as some opponents had urged  the court to consider the ban, because of its importance, but  same-sex couple supporters had asked that the ban passed by  voters earlier this month be put on hold in the mean time.      Some 52 percent of voters agreed to amend the state  constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman.      Gay advocates argued that Californians could not strip a  right from a minority with only a majority-approved  constitutional amendment. A more rigorous process called a  constitutional revision was required, they argued.      National Center for Lesbian Rights' legal director Shannon  Minter said if the court backed the proposition, then the  rights of any group could be stripped by simple majority vote.      'It mandates discrimination,' he said of Prop 8, adding  similar ones would follow. 'I really can't imagine a more  serious issue before the court, or a more frightening one.'      Ban supporters said the single-sentence change was too  limited to require a full constitutional revision and that the  state constitution gave wide latitude to the people through the  amendment process.      'It would be a radical departure from 150 years of  precedent (to overturn Prop 8),' said Pugno, calling the  challenge a 'long shot.'      'I think the larger question is going to be what is the  status of the marriages that were created prior to the  election,' he said, adding that he had not taken a legal stand  on the issue and was researching.      The court said it would hear arguments on the amendment  process, the effect of Prop 8 o",

Times, some gay rights supporters in Hollywood may be starting a blacklist against people who supported traditional marriage by giving money to Prop 8 advocates.\n\nJoining us now from Los Angeles is Andrew Breitbart, publisher of Breitbart.com, and one of a handful of conservatives who are brave enough to speak out in Hollywood. Andrew, great to see you.\n\nClick here to watch the segment.\n\nANDREW BREITBART, BREITBART.COM: Hey, Laura. How are you?\n\nINGRAHAM: I remember when George Clooney was telling us that, you know, the biggest threat to mankind, you know, a few decades back was the blacklisting in Hollywood of people who dared to question authority. And so is this actually happening now on the other side of the political fence?\n\nBREITBART: Well, this is a more conspicuous form of blacklisting. It happens for conservatives every single day in Hollywood. This FEC search mechanism is a way that the left, the activist left, not specifically gay groups, because there are a lot of gay people who are against gay marriage. There are a lot of people who think that it should be up for debate.\n\nBut this is the same group of people back in the 1980s, Michelangelo Signorile, who started OutWeek magazine, who started to out people who were actually gay who didn't agree with the activist left agenda for the gay community. So what's happening right now is those schoolyard bullies are back, playing a bigger game on a bigger playground.\n\nINGRAHAM: Right.\n\nBREITBART: Yes.\n\nINGRAHAM: What are they actually doing? What's being done to people who have given to Prop 8? Because I know the San Francisco Chronicle is allowing people who go to their Web site to find out who gave to what Prop 8 groups.\n\nBREITBART: It's there. That's exactly what they are doing. Scott Eckern, who is the musical \u2014 the director of the California Musical Theater, had his name initially exposed, and he had to step down. To me that's an effective blacklist.\n\nEl Coyote restaurant in Los Angeles, the floor manager, not the owner but the floor manager, gave $100. And people started to protest El Coyote restaurant. So it's not just about blacklisting. It's blacklisting entire institutions if somebody is associated with it.\n\nMy father-in-law, who was blacklisted in the 1950s for being a communist, is a Christian now, believes in the sanctity of marriage, of the definition between a man and a woman, and they are protesting his theater in Venice, California.\n\nINGRAHAM: So right now there clearly is no real free speech in Hollywood. There's no political free speech. If major Hollywood executives don't speak out against this intimidation, they have no credibility. I don't want to see another movie about the blacklist of the 1940s and '50s. I don't want to see it again coming out of Hollywood. They have no credibility with me. None.\n\nBREITBART: Well, what's so important about this issue right now is that George Clooney is silent, and secondly, President-elect Barack Obama is against gay marriage. Joe Biden, Vice President-elect Joe Biden is against gay marriage. So were Bill and Hillary Clinton when they implemented don't ask, don't tell and the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\nWhat they have done specifically is isolate conservative groups, the Mormon Church, which is safe. I asked Michelangelo Signorile to go down to a local mosque with a group of angry activist left people and to protest the Islamic position on gay marriage. He won't do that.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nBREITBART: And he won't go after President-elect Barack Obama. President-elect Barack Obama has an aggressive attitude towards gay rights in this country, and they allow for him to get away with it.\n\nINGRAHAM: Well, Andrew, that is such a great point about the mosque. I mean, that would show true courage, OK? Go after the black churches and the mosques, and we'll see whether they're actually going to put their money where their mouths are.\n\nAndrew, thanks a lot.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2008 FOX News Network, LLC.

      "Text": "    By Alex Dobuzinskis      LOS ANGELES, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Battling to save the right  to same-sex marriage in what is expected to be a close state  vote next month, California gay rights backers are turning to  Hollywood celebrities for help at a major fundraiser.      Actress and singer Barbra Streisand is expected at the  event on Tuesday and singers Melissa Etheridge and Mary J.  Blige will perform, organizers said on Thursday.      Supermarket billionaire Ron Burkle will host the event at  his Beverly Hills home, with a private $25,000-a-plate dinner.  Among other entertainment figures planning to attend are  actor/director Rob Reiner.      In recent weeks, director Steven Spielberg and actor Brad  Pitt each donated $100,000 in support of the campaign to  preserve the right to gay marriage.      The fundraiser comes as backers of same-sex marriage fight  to stem a tide of support for Proposition 8, a Nov. 4 ballot  measure that seeks to define marriage under the California  Constitution as only between a man and a woman.      A poll released last week by Survey USA showed 47 percent  of Californians supported the measure, while 42 percent opposed  it.      'We're feeling very good about the surge in the campaign,'  said Sonja Eddings Brown, a spokeswoman for Protect Marriage,  the group advocating for a 'Yes' vote on Proposition 8.      The 'Yes' campaign has raised $25.4 million, compared with  $15.8 million for those who wish to maintain the right to gay  marriage.      In recent weeks, advocates of same-sex marriage have chided  the Hollywood community for failing to contribute cash to the  campaign to defeat Proposition 8.      But Geoff Kors, executive director of Equality California,  said the fundraiser would show Hollywood's support for   same-sex marriage rights.      'Having support from Hollywood leaders who are visible, who  reach a wide audience, is critical to our success,' Kors said.      'It's always really scary when you're being outspent 2 to   1 in an election, and when your rights are at stake and  someone's trying to take your rights away,' he added.      In recent days, opponents of same-sex marriage have stepped  up their television advertising and warned voters that if  Proposition 8 is defeated, children will be taught about gay  marriage in elementary schools.      Gay-marriage supporters call that argument misleading.      In California, an estimated 11,000 same-sex couples have  married since the state's highest court in May overturned a  state ban on same-sex marriage.      Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres and actress Portia de Rossi  wed in August in one the most high-profile same-sex unions.  Etheridge has said she plans to marry girlfriend Tammy Lynn  Michaels before Nov. 4.      DeGeneres released an online video message this week urging  California voters to strike down Proposition 8.      Gay and lesbian marriage was legalized last week in  Connecticut, bringing to three the number of U.S. states that  allow it.

      "Text": "    By Peter Henderson      SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Thousands of gay marriage  advocates held boisterous rallies on Saturday across the United  States and abroad in a coordinated protest of California's vote  this month to ban same-sex marriage.      In Manhattan, where some protesters were offering hula-hoop  demonstrations, Sean Petersen, 21, a musician from Brooklyn,  called the vote 'mean-spirited and divisive.'      In Chicago, Andy Thayer, a co-founder of the Gay Liberation  Network, exhorted a crowd that had listened to a gay men's  choir sing a peppy version of the hymn 'Down by the Riverside'  to follow through on the spirit of the protest.      'We can't just let this be a blowing-off-steam rally, as  satisfying as that might be,' he said. 'We're here to win equal  marriage rights right here in Illinois.'      Demonstrations had been organized for Saturday afternoon in  the United States and elsewhere, including Canada, Europe and  Australia, coordinated by a campaign on the Internet.      Los Angeles police estimated 8,000 attended, and thousands  filled the central plaza in San Francisco. Other cities had  crowds estimated in the hundreds or low thousands.      'I am here to protect my marriage and my family,' said  39-year-old Susan Ferris at Los Angeles City Hall.      On Nov. 4, California voters narrowly approved Proposition  8, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman. It  reversed the right of gays and lesbians to marry that had been  granted by the state's Supreme Court this year and triggered a  series of protests.      'A turning point has been reached,' landscape architect  James York, 45, said at the San Francisco rally.           $70 MILLION CAMPAIGN      Measures to ban gay marriage also passed in Florida and  Arizona, while Arkansas barred gay couples from adopting  children.      In 2003, Massachusetts became the first state to legalize  gay marriages. Last month, Connecticut became the second when  the state's top court overturned a ban on same-sex marriage.      The California measure passed by 52 percent after one of  the most expensive ballot campaigns in history in which both  sides combined raised some $70 million.      Gay marriage advocates have asked the California Supreme  Court to overturn the ban, arguing that more than a majority  vote is needed to make a fundamental change in the state  constitution. In May, the court had declared same-sex marriage  a right, unleashing a flood of weddings.      The rallies drew a few opponents of gay marriage.      'We're troubled by the intolerance on their side about what  obviously is the will of the American people,' Peter LaBarbera,  a board member of Protect Marriage Illinois, told Reuters. 'We  think they represent the minority viewpoint.'      Despite the setback in the country's most populous state,  gay marriage advocates said they were upbeat about their cause  in the long run.      'History is on our side,' said Ferris in Los Angeles.

      "Text": "    By Peter Henderson      SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Same-sex marriage  advocates plan to 'Call in gay' on Wednesday in a protest  designed to show Americans how big a part of daily life -- and  the economy -- gays and their supporters are.      The Internet-organized project, which follows California's  passage of anti-same-sex-marriage Proposition 8, urges 'Day  Without a Gay' participants to skip work and volunteer in the  community.      The idea is creating a controversy over how to garner  support without protesters hurting their cause.      Californians struck down same-sex marriage last month,  reversing a court decision that had affirmed the right. The  Nov. 4 vote stopped gay unions in California -- one of a  handful of states, provinces and mostly European countries that  allowed it.      After the vote, protest marches targeted U.S. temples of  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Mormons,  who were top supporters of California Proposition 8, which  limits marriage to a man and a woman. That led to a nationwide  protest day on Nov. 15.      'In order for this movement to continue it can't just be  about marching and being pissed off. It's got to be creative in  different ways to get into the hearts and minds of moderate  voters,' said daywithoutagay.org creator Sean Hetherington.      The Los Angeles comedian and his boyfriend, Aaron Hartzler,  put the focus on volunteering, although one of the groups  behind the Nov. 15 rallies, jointheimpact.com, urges people to  shut businesses and avoid spending anything.      The protest appears inspired by the 2004 film 'A Day  Without a Mexican' which imagines the effect on California of a  day when there are no Latinos, leading to chaos on the state.

But the fourth member of the coalition, the Christian  Democrats, refused to back the bill which will now need the  support of at least one of the centre-left opposition parties.      The three opposition parties said they were ready to work  together with the centre-right parties, with the aim of having  the new legislation in place as soon as possible.      'We are very pleased to finally be able make these changes,'  Moderate party MP Lars Lindblad told a news conference.      'There is a firm basis for a broad agreement between six  parties,' he added, referring to a possible deal including all  parties in the Swedish Riksdag except the Christian Democrats.      The change in the law, which currently allows gay couples to  register unions but not formal marriage, would come into force  by May 1 this year under the timetable set out in the bill.      The proposed new legislation would eliminate legal  distinctions between heterosexual and homosexual spouses, but it  would not force dissenting clergy to wed gay couples.      The Swedish Lutheran church, which split from the state in  2000, has said it was open to celebrating and registering  same-sex unions, though it wanted to reserve the term matrimony  for heterosexual marriages.      The church already performs blessing ceremonies for gay  couples who have registered unions with civil authorities after  a church council decision in 2005 which outraged conservatives.

For them, homosexuality is a sin. I don't agree, but then again, I'm a heathen who once bought an adjustable bed for recreational reasons.\n\nThe fact is, gays aren't picketing black churches because that would be hard and scary. Any moron who remembers Eddy Murphy's stand-up routine knows that blacks haven't always warmed to gay causes. They probably also don't enjoy comparisons between their civil rights struggle and gays not being allowed to marry. Yeah, I know gays have been treated like crap over the years, but they were never slaves, unless it was requested on Craigslist.\n\nBut, maybe instead of marching down Sunset on a Sunday, gays should hit the churches, community meetings and the like to promote their cause. It's what decent folk do to get their point across.\n\nAnd remember, it was David Geffen who helped picked Obama and it was Obama's main supporters who voted for Prop 8.\n\nSo blame Geffen, not the Mormons.\n\nLastly, although I don't give two poops about the right to marry, I wonder why they'd want it.

      "Text": "    By Adam Tanner      SAN FRANCISCO, March 4 (Reuters) - Four years after San  Francisco ignited passionate embraces and heated national  debate by briefly allowing gay marriage, California's top court  hears arguments on Tuesday as to whether matrimony should be  limited to a man and a woman.      The hearing brings into focus the highest-profile U.S.  fight over gay rights in recent years and the outcome could end  up influencing legislation and litigation in other states.      San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom forced the issue by suddenly  issuing gay marriage licenses in February 2004. More than 4,000  homosexual couples took him up on the offer, including comedian  Rosie O'Donnell and her partner, until a lower court halted the  process.      Later that year California's Supreme Court ruled that  Newsom, mayor of a city long at the forefront of gay rights,  had no authority to wed gays and voided the marriages.      The same court just across the street from City Hall where  the gay marriages took place now decides the larger question  whether California can legally bar same-sex matrimony.      Gay marriage supporters won an initial battle when a  Superior Court judge ruled in their favor in 2005. The  following year a state appeals court judge overruled that  decision and backed existing state law.      Californians in 2000 approved a ballot measure defining  marriage as the union of man and woman. But domestic  partnership legislation as of 2005 gave registered gay couples  many of the same privileges enjoyed by married couples.      Since 2005 California's legislature twice voted to allow gay  marriages, but Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who is  liberal on many social issues, vetoed the bills, saying voters or  the courts should decide the issue.           UNUSUAL SESSION      It now falls to the seven justices of the California  Supreme Court to resolve the matter, and they have 90 days from  the hearing to issue an opinion. With six of the judges  appointed by Republican governors and one appointed by a  Democrat, the panel is considered politically moderate.      The court has made a rare exception to its one-hour total  limit on oral arguments and will hold a three-hour session.      'I can't recall any where there were three hours of  arguments, I really can't,' Cruz Reynoso told Reuters about his  years as a California Supreme Court justice from 1982-87.      'Not often, but sometimes, oral arguments actually make a  difference in difficult cases and I assume that the court  considers this a difficult case.'      More than half of U.S. states have passed constitutional  amendments barring gay marriage, and President George W. Bush has  proposed a U.S. Constitutional amendment.      State supreme courts in Massachusetts, New Jersey and  Vermont have ruled against limiting marriage to a man and a  woman. Massachusetts responded by becoming the only U.S. state  to allow gay marriage, while New Jersey and Vermont instead  passed civil union laws similar to those in California.      Several other state supreme courts, including those in New  York, Washington and Maryland, found that marriage can be  limited to one man, one woman.

      "Text": "    By Amanda Beck      SAN FRANCISCO, June 3 (Reuters) - U.S. opponents of gay  marriage pushed their campaign on both coasts this week,  setting it up as a potential hot-button issue in the Nov. 4  elections around the country.      Activists said on Tuesday California was set for its  biggest political battle in years after it was announced the  November ballot would include a constitutional amendment  limiting marriage to unions between men and women.      A similar measure also is on the November ballot in  Florida, which is likely to be closely fought in the election,  and there also are national implications.      'Values voters have even more reason to go to the polls in  2008,' said Tony Perkins, a leading religious conservative who  is president of the Family Research Council.      Initiatives to ban gay marriage played a role in President  George W. Bush's 2004 re-election as they propelled the  Republican Party's conservative Christian base to the polls.      In New York, conservative lawmakers were among those who  filed a suit against Gov. David Paterson on Tuesday, charging  that he overstepped his authority by ordering state agencies to  recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages.      California is scheduled to begin marrying gay couples later  this month but until then, Massachusetts is the only state that  allows same-sex marriage. More than 25 states have  constitutional amendments barring gay marriage.      Although Republican presidential candidate John McCain is  viewed by many religious conservatives as soft on core values  issues, gay marriage could affect turnout where it is on the  ballot.      'Which will actually be a larger draw in California? Will  the presidential choice motivate people or will the issue of  marriage motivate people?' said Ron Prentice, chairman of the  Protect Marriage Coalition, a group of 31 organizations that  are sponsoring the measure in California.      'We believe that this measure on the ballot will actually  bring significantly more people to vote,' he said.           BATTLE IN CALIFORNIA      If more than half of California voters approve the measure,  it would neutralize last month's state Supreme Court ruling  that said preventing same-sex couples from marrying was  unconstitutional and discriminatory.      'This will be the biggest battle on the West Coast since  the recall,' Randy Thomasson, president of the Campaign for  Children and Families in reference to the emotional 2003  election that recalled then-California Gov. Gray Davis.      Gay marriage opponents are urging county officials to  practice civil disobedience by refusing to marry same-sex  couples this month when the marriages are scheduled to begin.      The group behind the California ballot measure expects to  spend at least $10 million campaigning for it.      Gay marriage proponents have said they will match them  dollar-for-dollar. 'We believe that the time has passed that an  amendment like this could survive at the ballot box,' said Kate  Kendall of the National Center for Lesbian Rights.      Polls offer conflicting predictions. A Field poll published  last week showed 51 percent in favor of gay marriage with 42  percent opposed. But a Los Angeles Times poll the previous week  found 54 percent backed the amendment defining marriage as  between a man and a woman with 35 percent opposed.      Evangelical Protestants, who account for one in four  American adults, are especially keen to prohibit gay marriage,",

It's one of several important ballot measures voters will  face in states across the country on Election Day.      'A lot more gays are more open about their relationships,  and a lot more people are willing to accept it,' Merkens said  in downtown Los Angeles recently.      Other passersby disagreed. 'Same sex marriage is a sin,'  said city planner Kim Chan.      Tuesday's results will show how far attitudes to gay  marriage have changed. Florida and Arizona will join California  in voting on whether to stop gay marriage.      In the past, such propositions have almost always been  approved, but polls show a close finish in California and many  undecided in all three states.      Legal abortion also faces a key challenge as South Dakotans  consider a measure to severely restrict the procedure. If it  passes, opponents are expected to challenge it all the way to  the U.S. Supreme Court. A poll by the state Argus Leader  newspaper showed that vote a toss-up.      Altogether, 150 measures in about 35 states will be put to  the vote on the same day the next U.S. president is chosen,  with other issues ranging from affirmative action to how farm  animals are treated. [ID:nN01396494].      A California court in May rejected limiting marriage to a  man and a woman. Only a few nations and states agree.      Now Hollywood stars like Brad Pitt are facing off with  conservative foes like the fast-growing Mormon church, the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, over Proposition  8, which would ban same-sex marriage.      Both sides have broad, deep pockets: ban proponents have  raised about $30 million, and opponents recently topped that.           MORE IMPORTANT THAN PRESIDENCY      'This is the most important thing on the November 4th  ballot,' said Tony Perkins, president of the conservative  Family Research Council. 'We've made bad selections as  presidents but survived as a nation. But if we move down the  path towards the dissolution of marriage we cannot divorce  ourselves from the consequences of that.'      Episcopal Bishop Marc Andrus supports gay marriage and said  a ballot loss would slow the process -- not stop it.      Californians in 2000 passed a measure to define marriage as  between a man and a woman. At that time, the San Francisco Bay  Area was the only part of the state that supported gay  marriage, said pollster Mark DiCamillo of the Field Poll.      This year, all the coastal areas support gay marriage, and  support in the inland valleys, which have values similar to the  center of the United States, has grown but remains small.      Los Angeles County had the biggest swing, he said. 'It's  the moderates who have moved,' he said.      John Matsusaka, president of the Initiative and Referendum  Institute at the University of Southern California, said  voters, especially younger ones, were used to homosexuality.     'It doesn't have shock value any more,' Matsusaka said.      A ProtectMarriage.org flyer argues that gay marriage will  be taught in schools if the ban fails, a position their  opponents reject. Same-sex marriage supporters focus on equal  rights for all. 'People you know are asking you to vote no",

      "Text": "    May 15 (Reuters) - The California Supreme Court ruled on  Thursday the state cannot bar same-sex marriages, marking a  major victory for gay rights advocates that may have national  implications.      Here is a look at laws on gay marriage and same-sex civil  unions in the United States:      * Massachusetts is the only U.S. state to allow gay  marriage. Its highest court ruled in 2003 that a ban on gay  marriage was unconstitutional, paving the way for America's  first same-sex marriages the following year.      * Connecticut, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Vermont permit  same-sex civil unions that grant largely the same state rights  as married couples -- from insurance coverage to tax benefits  and hospital visiting rights -- but lack the full, federal  legal protections of marriage.      * California, Maine, the District of Columbia, Hawaii and  Washington each offer gay couples some legal rights as  partners.      * Currently, 45 states have laws explicitly prohibiting  same-sex marriage, including 26 with constitutional amendments  restricting marriage to one man and one woman and 19 with  statutory laws barring same-sex unions.      * The patchwork of laws has caused some unusual  complications. Rhode Island's top court, for example, ruled in  December 2007 that a same-sex couple married in Massachusetts  could not legally divorce in Rhode Island, saying the state's  family court did not have authority over same-sex marriages.      * Massachusetts currently allows out-of-state same-sex  couples from just two states -- Rhode Island and New Mexico --  to marry there, since those states' laws do not clearly  prohibit gay marriage.      * More than 8,000 same-sex couples have married in  Massachusetts.      * The U.S. Supreme Court has not taken a case on gay  marriage, leaving states to decide the issue.      * The Arizona House of Representatives voted 33-25 on May  13 to put a proposed constitutional amendment to prohibit  same-sex marriage on the statewide ballot in November.

      "Text": "    By Axel Bugge      LISBON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Portugal's parliament rejected a  proposal on Friday to allow gay marriage, sparking anger among  gays who say they face discrimination in the conservative  Catholic country.      The proposal by the small Left Bloc and Green parties to  overturn an existing ban was overwhelmingly rejected as the  ruling Socialists, who hold a majority, joined the centre-right  opposition in opposing the move.      Parliament president Jaime Gaime did not give a final vote  breakdown but said the proposal had been rejected, the  legislature's television channel showed.      Outside parliament, about thirty gays protested by staging  two mock marriages.      'I am here because there are citizens who are full citizens  in their duties but not citizens in their rights and that is a  very serious mistake in a democracy,' Joana, a woman who married  her partner, told Reuters Television.      'Old homophobes!' a gay protester shouted inside the voting  chamber after the vote, before being led out by police.      Gays were encouraged that a referendum in Portugal last year  overturned a ban on abortion, hoping it would usher in what they  see as more progressive and modern values elsewhere in Europe.  Neighbouring Spain has allowed gay marriages since 2005.      But Catholic values still hold sway on many social issues in  Portugal. Cardinal Jose Policarpo, the patriarch of Lisbon,  warned that allowing gay marriages would be a violation of the  family.      'What is in question is breaking the profound conception of  the family,' he said on Radio Renascenca, a Catholic radio  station.      Alice Ferreira, a 70-year-old pensioner, told SIC television  that gays could have their own sexual preferences but they  should not be allowed to marry.      'I don't think they could be real marriages because  marriages are intended to create families,' she said.      Supporters of the change argue that the ban on gay marriage  included in Portugal's civil code is illegal under the 1975  constitution, which bans sexual discrimination.      Polls have shown under 30 percent of Portuguese approve of  gay marriage against an average around 45 percent in the  European Union, according to Eurobarometer.

      "Text": "    By Peter Henderson      SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 24 (Reuters) - California's gay marriage  ban could open the door to legal discrimination against  unpopular groups if the state Supreme Court allows the  voter-approved measure to stand, blacks, Latinos, Asians and  other minorities said.      The Nov. 4 vote, supporting an end to legal same-sex  marriage in the most populous U.S. state, has caused a  nationwide furor as opponents of the measure decry what they  consider a civil rights violation.      California's highest court agreed on Nov. 19 to hear a  challenge, based on whether the state constitution requires  support from the legislature -- as well as a majority vote of  the people -- to strip rights from any group.      The court had recognized such marriages in May, and about  20,000 same-sex couples wed before the November vote. Those  marriages may now hang in the balance. Connecticut and  Massachusetts are the only states that allow gay marriage.      Legal scholars say the measure, which defines marriage as  between a man and a woman, breaks new ground by limiting the  courts' ability to protect minorities.      'They could take away any right from any group,' said  University of Southern California Law Professor David Cruz, who  filed a brief in favor of gay marriage in an earlier case.        EQUAL PROTECTION 'SUBVERSION'      The ban, California Proposition 8, amended the constitution  with 52 percent support -- less than is required to approve  some state bond measures.      'The entire purpose behind the constitutional principle of  equal protection would be subverted if the constitutional  protection of unpopular minorities were subject to simple  majority rule,' read a brief by black, Asian and Hispanic  groups challenging the ban. 'This case is not simply about gay  and lesbian equality.'      It is unlikely that relatively liberal California would  approve restrictions on racial and religious minorities,  especially ones that clash with the protections guaranteed by  the U.S. Constitution, Cruz and others say.      'We are past that as a realistic matter. We just elected an  African-American president, for Christ's sake,' said University  of California, Berkeley, law professor Jesse Choper, who also  filed on behalf of gay advocates in the original gay marriage  case.      Other groups -- from prisoners to undocumented workers --  might not have public opinion on their side.      'The history of California demonstrates with sobering  clarity the potential for disfavored minorities to be subjected  to oppression by hostile majorities,' the minority groups say  in their brief, pointing to segregation laws and one excluding  Asian-Americans from land ownership as examples.        'TRACK RECORD'      'It is not hypothetical. It's a track record,' said  Stanford University law professor Jane Schacter, who has not  filed briefs in the case.      Indeed, a central argument in support of the gay marriage  ban is that majority-vote constitutional amendments can change  rights.      'That power is broad and deep and, by nature, populist. It  has often been used to be make significant changes in state  government and to override judicial interpretations of the  Constitution with which the people disagree -- including  interpretations involving basic constitutional rights,' lawyer  Andrew Pugno argued in court papers.      He also argued that defining marriage as between a man and  a woman simply re-established the situation befo",

      "Text": "By Tommy De SenoAttorney/Writer\n\nThe emphasis must not be on the right to abortion, but on the right to privacy and reproductive control.--Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n\nToday marks another anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court decision which overturned all state laws that would stop a woman from having an abortion in the first trimester.\n\nWhile the topic I have chosen here, \"Roe vs. Wade and the Rights of the Father\" may sound interesting, actually there is nothing to write about. There are no such rights.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_6052\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"(AP file photo)\"][/caption]\n\nA father can't stop an abortion if he wants his child, nor can he insist upon an abortion if he doesn't want his child.\n\nThis situation should trouble everyone, not from a religious point of view, not from a personal choice point of view, but rather from an Equal Rights point of view.\n\nEqual Rights for all people is difficult for any nation to achieve peaceably, because it requires the group in greater power to yield to the group of lesser power. This is usually accomplished only through war. Our own Civil War is a perfect example of equality being created by force, instead of reason and fairness, as it should have been.\n\nThis week as I watched and read opinions about Roe vs. Wade, I could find nothing, not a word among millions that addressed a father's relationship to his unborn child.\n\nTwo weeks ago I tried an experiment in anticipation of writing this column. I wrote a column about gun control and posited that only men should vote on the issue of guns. The logic (rather illogic) used by me was that men buy guns the most, men are called upon to use them most (when a burglar enters our home) and we get shot the most. Why shouldn't men have the only voice on the issue?\n\nI wanted to gauge people's reactions to the thought that in America we would ever give more weight to one person's view than another's because that person can show the issue affects him more.\n\nAs I walked around my city during these past two weeks, I was accosted by people who wanted to take me to task for suggesting that women lose their right to vote on an issue just because they may be affected by it less than men. Some pointed out, quite rightly, that even if there was an issue that didn't affect women at all, as equal members of society, they should still have a voice in all decisions America makes.\n\nQuite right indeed.\n\nSo where are all these well-reasoned arguments when it comes to a father and his unborn child? Why do people who have Equal Protection claims at the ready on other issues suddenly suffer constitutional amnesia when abortion is mentioned?\n\nDuring every abortion a father's child dies, so fathers are affected. There is much written about the post-abortion depression of women. Nothing is mentioned about the father. A good father knows his role is protector of his child. His depression must be crippling when the law allows him no chance to save his child from death by abortion.\n\nIn the Roe vs. Wadedecision the Supreme Court found a privacy right in the 14thAmendment, which doesn't have the word \"privacy\" in it. Then they found that the privacy right had a \"penumbra\" containing other rights (penumbra means the shadowy area at the edge of a shadow). In that shadow they found the abortion right. That bit of mental gymnastics aside, it wasn't the most terrible part of the decision. This was:\n\nThe Court said that a woman my not be mentally ready to handle a child at this stage in her life, or the child might interfere with her career path, and that is so important to her that the State has no right to make a law against it.\n\nSo I ask today: Might a father find himself mentally not ready for a child? Might a father find a child inconvenient to his career path? If these are the rights women get to protect by choosing abortion, why not allow fathers \"the right to choose\" also?\n\nI propose a \"father's abortion.\" Let a father petition the Court to terminate his own parental rights to his child before or after the child's birth. He would be rid of his obligations to that child in favor of his mental health and finances, the same as a woman does when she aborts.\n\nAs Justice Ginsburg said in the quote that appears at the top of this FOX Forum post, the emphasis is not abortion, rather an individual's right to control his own reproduction. If we protect such a right for women, can we constitutionally deny it to men?\n\nI propose this not because it would be in any way good. I propose it because constitutional Equal Protection demands it, and to show the danger created when judges destroy democracy by making up laws that don't exist.\n\n\"Father's Abortion.\" It's high time for a test case.\n\nAny father with such a case can call me and I'll take it for free.\n\nRead more from Tommy De Seno at www.JustifiedRight.com.\n\nAlso, check out Opposing Views for more information on the Roe V.

      "Text": "This is the second part of a two part series on abortion. The first part can be found here.\n\nViolent crime in the United States soared after 1960. From 1960 to 1991, reported violent crime increased by an incredible 372 percent. This disturbing trend was seen across the country, with robbery peaking in 1991 and rape and aggravated assault following in 1992. But then something unexpected happened: Between 1991 and 2000, rates of violent crime and property crime fell sharply, dropping by 33 percent and 30 percent, respectively. Murder rates were stable up to 1991, but then plunged by a steep 44 percent.\n\nMany plausible explanations have been advanced for the drop during the 1990s. Some stress law-enforcement measures, such as higher arrest and conviction rates, longer prison sentences, \u201cbroken windows\u201d police strategies, and the death penalty. Others emphasize right-to-carry laws for concealed handguns, a strong economy, or the waning of the crack-cocaine epidemic.\n\nYet, of all the explanations, perhaps the most controversial is the one that attributes lower crime rates in the \u201990s to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 decision to mandate legalized abortion. According to this argument, the large number of women who began having abortions shortly after Roe were most likely unmarried, in their teens, or poor, and their children would have been \u201cunwanted.\u201d Children born in these circumstances would have had a higher-than-average likelihood of becoming criminals, and would have entered their teens \u2014 their \u201ccriminal prime\u201d \u2014 in the early 1990s. But because they were aborted, they were not around to make trouble.\n\nIt is an attention-grabbing theory, to be sure, possibly even more noteworthy than recent research indicating that liberalizing abortion increased pre-marital sex, increased out-of-wedlock births, reduced adoptions and ended so-called shotgun marriages.\n\nBut a thorough analysis of abortion and crime statistics leads to the opposite conclusion: that abortion increases crime.\n\nThe question about abortion and crime was greatly influenced by a Swedish study published in 1966 by Hans Forssman and Inga Thuwe. They followed the children of 188 women who were denied abortions from 1939 to 1941 at the only hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden. Their study compared these \u201cunwanted\u201d children with another group, this one composed of the first child born at the hospital after each of the \u201cunwanted\u201d children. They found that the \u201cunwanted\u201d children were much more likely to grow up in adverse conditions \u2014 for example, with divorced parents, or in foster homes. These children were also more likely to become delinquents and have trouble in school. Unfortunately, the authors never investigated whether the children\u2019s \u201cunwantedness\u201d caused their problems, or were simply correlated with them.\n\nForssman and Thuwe\u2019s claim, notwithstanding the limits of the data supporting it, became axiomatic among supporters of legalized abortion. During the 1960s and \u201970s, before Roe, abortion-rights advocates attributed all sorts of social ills, including crime and mental illness, to \u201cunwanted\u201d children. Weeding these poor, crime-prone people out of the population through abortion was presented as a way to make society safer.\n\nIndeed, the 1972 Rockefeller Commission on Population and the American Future, established by Richard Nixon, cited research purporting that the children of women denied an abortion \u201cturned out to have been registered more often with psychiatric services, engaged in more antisocial and criminal behavior, and have been more dependent on public assistance.\u201d\n\nEven in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roe v. Wade, Justice Harry Blackmun noted the same social problems attributed to \u201cunwanted\u201d children.\n\nRecently, two economists \u2014 John Donohue and Steven Levitt \u2014 tried resurrecting the debate. They presented evidence that supposedly demonstrated abortion\u2019s staggeringly large effect on crime rates, and argued that up to \u201cone-half of the overall crime reduction\u201d between 1991 and 1997, and up to 81 percent of the drop in murder rates during that period, was attributable to the rise in abortions in the early to mid 1970s. If that claim was accurate, they had surely found the Holy Grail of crime reduction.\n\nMost people who challenge the \u201cabortion reduces crime\u201d argument do so on ethical grounds, rather than trying to rebut the empirical evidence. But it is worth looking at the data, too \u2014 because they do not prove what they are supposed to.\n\nTo understand why abortion might not cut crime, one should first consider how dramatically it changed sexual relationships. Once abortion became widely available, people engaged in much more premarital sex, and also took less care in using contraceptives. Abortion, after all, offered a backup if a woman got pregnant, making premarital sex, and the nonuse of contraception, less risky. In practice, however, many women found that they couldn\u2019t go through with an abortion, and out-of-wedlock births soared. Few of these children born out of wedlock were put up for adoption; most women who were unwilling to have abortions were also unwilling to give up their children. Abortion also eliminated the social pressure on men to marry women who got pregnant. All of these outcomes \u2014 more out-of-wedlock births, fewer adoptions than expected, and less pressure on men \u201cto do the right thing\u201d \u2014 led to a sharp increase in single-parent families.\n\nMultiple studies document this change. From the early 1970s through the late 1980s, as abortion became more and more frequent, there was a tremendous increase in the rate of out-of-wedlock births, from an average of 5 percent (1965\u201369) to over 16 percent 20 years later (1985\u20131989). Among blacks, the number jumped from 35 percent to 62 percent. While not all of this rise can be attributed to liberalized abortion laws, they were certainly a key contributor.\n\nWhat happened to all these children raised by single women? No matter how much they want their children, single parents tend to devote less attention to them than married couples do. Single parents are less likely than married parents to read to their children or take them on excursions, and more likely to feel angry at their children or to feel that they are burdensome. Children raised out of wedlock have more social and developmental problems than children of married couples by almost any measure \u2014 from grades to school expulsion to disease. Unsurprisingly, children from unmarried families are also more likely to become criminals.\n\nSo the opposing lines of argument in the \u201cabortion reduces crime\u201d debate are clear: One side stresses that abortion eliminates \u201cunwanted\u201d children, the other that it increases out-of-wedlock births. The question is: Which consequence of abortion has the bigger impact on crime?\n\nUnfortunately for those who argue that abortion reduces crime, Donahue and Levitt\u2019s research suffered from methodological flaws. As The Economist noted, \u201cDonohue and Levitt did not run the test that they thought they had.\u201d Work by two economists at the Boston Federal Reserve, Christopher Foote and Christopher Goetz, found that, when the test was run correctly, it indicated that abortion actually increases violent crime. John Whitley and I had written an earlier study that found a similar connection between abortion and murder \u2014 namely, that legalizing abortion raised the murder rate, on average, by about 7 percent.\n\nThe \u201cabortion decreases crime\u201d theory runs into even more problems when the population is analyzed by age group. Suppose that liberalizing abortion in the early 1970s can indeed explain up to 80 percent of the drop in murder during the 1990s, as Donohue and Levitt claim. Deregulating abortion would then reduce criminality first among age groups born after the abortion laws changed, when the \u201cunwanted,\u201d crime-prone elements began to be weeded out. Yet when we look at the declining murder rate during the 1990s, we find that this is not the case at all. Instead, murder rates began falling first among an older generation \u2014 those over 26 \u2014 born before Roe. It was only later that criminality among those born after Roe began to decline.\n\nLegalizing abortion increased crime. Those born in the four years after Roe were much more likely to commit murder than those born in the four years prior. This was especially true when they were in their \u201ccriminal prime,\u201d as shown in the nearby chart.\n\nThe \u201cabortion decreases crime\u201d argument gets even weaker when one looks at data from Canada. While crime rates in both the United States and Canada began declining at the same time, Canada liberalized its abortion laws much later than the U.S. did. Although Quebec effectively legalized abortion in late 1976, it wasn\u2019t until 1988, in a case originating in Ontario, that the Canadian supreme court struck down limits on abortion nationwide. If the legalization of abortion in the U.S. caused crime to begin dropping 18 years later, why did the crime rate begin falling just three years after the comparable legal change in Canada?\n\nEven if abortion did lower crime by culling out \u201cunwanted\u201d children (a conclusion derived from flawed statistics), this effect would be greatly outweighed by the rise in crime associated with the greater incidence of single-parent families that also follows from abortion liberalization. In short, more abortions have brought more crime.\n\n__________\n\nJohn Lott is the author of Freedomnomics and a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland.\n\nDiscuss the piece here.",

      "Text": "    By Michael Conlon, Religion Writer      CHICAGO, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Catholic  bishops' group said on Monday that Barack Obama's election as  president should be celebrated but he made it clear the church  would not compromise its strict stand against abortion.      Obama won solid support from Catholics in last week's  election, exit polls indicated, even though the church opposes  the view, supported by the Illinois Democratic senator, that a  woman has the right to choose whether to have an abortion. The  U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 legalized  abortion.      Obama's election 'is a moment that touches more than our  history when a country that once enshrined race slavery in its  very constitutional order should come to elect an African-  American to the presidency,' said Cardinal Francis George of  Chicago.      'In this, I truly believe, we must all rejoice,' the head  of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops told the group's  semi-annual meeting in Baltimore.      George said the country may have reached a point where 'all  races are safely within the American consensus.' But he voiced  concern that Catholics face political pressure when seeking  office to compromise on 'fundamental Catholic teachings.'      The central Christian teaching, George added, was that God  became man and 'took flesh in the womb of the Virgin Mary, nine  months before Jesus was born in Bethlehem.'      'This truth is celebrated in our liturgy because it is  branded into our spirit. The common good can never be  adequately incarnated in any society when those waiting to be  born can be legally killed at choice,' he said.      'If the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision that African-  Americans were other people's property and somehow less than  persons were still settled constitutional law, Mr. Obama would  not be president of the United States,' George said, referring  to the 1857 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.      'Today, as was the case a 150 years ago, common ground  cannot be found by destroying the common good,' he added.      The bishops issued a a general statement on issues before  the election, urging voters to consider all life issues in  casting ballots, including war and capital punishment.      Some bishops still came out against Obama during the  campaign over his stand on abortion. Abortion opponents have  expressed concern that possible Supreme Court appointments by  Obama could undo efforts to reverse Roe v. Wade.

      "Text": "    By Ed Stoddard      DALLAS, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Abortion rights activists, an  important component of the Democratic Party's base, expect to  advance their agenda under U.S. President-elect Barack Obama,  signaling fresh battles over the highly charged issue.      Changes could take place in areas from judicial appointments  to overseas aid. Obama strongly supports abortion rights, in stark  contrast to President George W. Bush, a social conservative who  often talked of a 'culture of life' -- code for opposition to  abortion.      With retirements looming on the U.S. Supreme Court, family  planning activists have indicated they want Obama to appoint  justices who will protect abortion rights.      The nine-member court is almost evenly divided between  conservatives and liberals, and an Obama presidency will likely  thwart the hopes of social conservatives for a bench that would  overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision which gave women a basic  constitutional right to an abortion.      On the policy front, activists and analysts say an early  skirmish could come over federal funding for nongovernmental  organizations that offer abortion operations or counseling in  family planning services abroad.      Such funding was first banned in the 1980s under Republican  President Ronald Reagan. Democratic President Bill Clinton  rescinded the order in 1993 but Bush reinstated it in 2001,  setting strict limits on the more than $400 million that the  United States spends on overseas family planning assistance  each year.      Critics call it the 'global gag rule' and the partisan  tit-for-tat -- Democratic politicians tend to woo abortion rights  advocates and Republicans generally appeal to opponents -- is  expected to continue when Obama assumes office in January.      'I think that rescinding this will be one of the first  executive orders that he issues,' said Michael Lindsay, a  political sociologist at Rice University in Houston. There is  great political pressure on Obama to act quickly on it given  the expectations from his party's base, Lindsay added.      Critics say the policy restricts funds to clinics offering  family planning services in developing countries, which reduces  access to such services and thus increases the number of unwanted  pregnancies.      Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, and  Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards told Reuters in  interviews that rolling back the rule was among their top  political priorities.      Abortion rights opponents, many of whom on religious  grounds regard the procedure as murder, see any move on that  front as the next shot in the abortion wars.      'To reintroduce funding for it internationally is very  offensive because there are even people who describe themselves  as pro-choice, but don't want to be involved in public funding  for it,' said Charmaine Yoest, president of Americans United  for Life Action, which opposes abortion rights.           BACK ON THE RADAR      Divisive social issues took a back seat to the sinking  economy and financial crisis during the campaign for the Nov. 4  presidential election.      While Democratic Party activists expect action to entrench  abortion rights, the Republican Party's conservative Christian  base is positioning itself for a new era with its flag bearers out  of power in both the White House and Congress.      The Democratic activists also hope to see policy changes to  improve access to contraception and othe",

      "Text": "  (adds background, reaction)      By Jeff Mason and Deborah Charles      WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama  on Friday lifted restrictions on U.S. government funding for  groups that provide abortion services or counseling abroad,  reversing a policy of his Republican predecessor George W.  Bush, a spokesman said.      The Democratic president's decision was a victory for  advocates of abortion rights on an issue that in recent years  has become a tit-for-tat policy change each time the White  House shifts from one party to the other.      When the ban was in place, no U.S. government funding for  family planning services could be given to clinics or groups  that offer abortion services or counseling in other countries  even if the funds for those activities come from non-U.S.  government sources.      Obama signed an executive order lifting the restrictions on  Friday, a White House spokesman said.      It has been called the Mexico City Policy because it was  unveiled at a United Nations conference there in 1984 and  became one of the centerpiece social policies of the  conservative administration of former President Ronald Reagan,  a Republican.      Critics call it the 'gag rule' because it also cuts funds  to groups that advocate or lobby for the lifting of abortion  restrictions, so they say it infringes on free speech. They also  say it has reduced healthcare for some of the world's poorest  women.      Former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, rescinded the  rule when he took office in January 1993 and his successor,  Republican George W. Bush, reinstated it in January 2001.           $400 MILLION ANNUALLY FOR OVERSEAS FAMILY PLANNING      When he reinstated it, Bush said taxpayer funds should not be  used to pay for or to advocate abortions.      Anti-abortion activists agreed with Bush and criticized the  move to lift the ban on funding.      'When we wake up every morning to a deepening financial  crisis, it is an insult to the American people to bail out the  abortion industry,' said Charmaine Yoest, president of  Americans United for Life.      'Planned Parenthood is a billion-dollar company and they do  not need additional resources to burden the American taxpayer,'  she added.      The United States spends more than $400 million on overseas  family planning assistance each year.      Critics of the funding ban say the anti-abortion  restrictions have resulted in huge drops for funding worldwide  to organizations that provide family-planning services and  basic healthcare. They say this means many women are deprived  of contraception and other health services in poor countries,  leading to back-alley abortions and deaths.      The Center for Reproductive Rights says, for example, that in  Ethiopia and Lesotho, some nongovernmental organizations are no  longer able to offer comprehensive and integrated healthcare  services to patients suffering from HIV/AIDS.      Abortion rights opponents and groups who support the Mexico  City Policy dispute the view that it has led to an increase of  illegal abortions or deaths overseas.      Unlike Clinton and Bush, Obama did not act on the rule on  the Jan. 22 anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973  Supreme Court ruling that made abortions legal throughout the  country.

      "Text": "  (adds background, reaction)      By Matt Spetalnick      WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama  on Friday will lift restrictions on U.S. government funding for  groups that provide abortion services or counseling abroad,  reversing a policy of his Republican predecessor George W.  Bush, an administration official said.      'It will be today. He's going to make an executive order  (lifting the global gag rule),' the official said.      The Democratic president's decision is a victory for advocates of  abortion rights on an issue that in recent years has become a  tit-for-tat policy change each time the White House shifts from one  party to the other.      When the ban was in place, no U.S. government funding for  family planning services could be given to clinics or groups  that offer abortion services or counseling in other countries  even if the funds for those activities come from non-U.S.  government sources.      It has been called the Mexico City Policy because it was  unveiled at a United Nations conference there in 1984 and  became one of the centerpiece social policies of the  conservative administration of former President Ronald Reagan,  a Republican.      Critics call it the 'gag rule' because it also cuts funds  to groups that advocate or lobby for the lifting of abortion  restrictions, so they say it infringes on free speech. They also say it  has reduced healthcare for some of the world's poorest women.      Former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, rescinded the  rule when he took office in January 1993 and his successor,  Republican George W. Bush, reinstated it in January 2001.      When he reinstated it, Bush said taxpayer funds should not  be used to pay for or advocate abortions.      Anti-abortion activists agreed with Bush and criticized the  move to lift the ban on funding.      'When we wake up every morning to a deepening financial  crisis, it is an insult to the American people to bail out the  abortion industry,' said Charmaine Yoest, president of  Americans United for Life.      'Planned Parenthood is a billion dollar company and they do not  need additional resources to burden the American taxpayer,' she added.

      "Text": "    By Jason Szep      NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Republican presidential  candidate John McCain courted female voters on Friday with  appearances on TV shows popular with women, but prompted boos  from a studio audience while stressing opposition to abortion.      In reply to a question on ABC television talk show 'The  View,' McCain told the five women hosts and its live studio  audience that he believed the U.S. Supreme Court's legalization  of abortion 35 years ago was a mistake.      'I believe Roe v Wade was a very bad decision, it was a bad  decision,' he said of the 1973 decision that established a  woman's right to an abortion.      The mostly female audience, who had cheered many of the  Arizona senator's earlier comments, responded with boos to that  reply.      The question was posed by host Elisabeth Hasselbeck, an  abortion opponent and supporter of the Iraq war who told McCain  that he had her vote in his close race against Democratic  Illinois Sen. Barack Obama in the Nov. 4 election for the White  House.      He also faced pointed questions about his selection of  little-known Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential  running mate and the McCain campaign's attempts to portray  their ticket as true agents of change in the election.      Host Barbara Walters interrupted McCain several times to  pin down what in Washington the 44-year-old self-described  'hockey mom' and conservative first-term governor of Alaska  would reform.      'The Republican Party. The Democratic Party. She's going to  reform all of Washington,' McCain said.      'What specifically?' Walters pressed, noting that McCain's  own party occupies the White House and has been in power in  Congress for much of the past eight years.      McCain won applause when speaking about his belief in God  and in the separation of church and state enshrined in the U.S.  Constitution. Host Whoopi Goldberg, an Oscar-winning actress,  asked if religion would guide him as president.      'Everyone, obviously, is entitled to their own faith,'  McCain said. 'I pray every day for guidance and to do the right  thing.'      McCain has aggressively courted undecided and independent  women voters, holding a round-table with women in the largely  Democratic city of Philadelphia on Wednesday and appearing on  two TV shows popular with women on Friday      After going on 'The View,' he taped the 'Rachael Ray Show,'  a popular daytime talk show and life style program where he  fielded questions in a studio kitchen and grilled ribs while  dressed in an apron that read 'kiss the candidate.' The show  will air Sept. 22.      The appearances are aimed in part at drawing disaffected  supporters of Democratic New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, who  lost a bruising primary to Obama.      McCain said he and his wife, Cindy, who also appeared on  'The View,' did not share Palin's more conservative view that  there should not be exceptions to his stand on abortion in  cases of rape and incest.      A Washington Post/ABC News survey published on Tuesday  found much of McCain's improvement in the polls since the  Republican National Convention ended Sept. 4 was due to a big  shift in support among white women voters.

And he came in for fire over advertisements that  independent fact-checkers say distort Obama's positions,  including one that said Obama was referring to Palin when he  used a colloquial expression about putting 'lipstick on a pig,'  and another claiming Obama wants sex education for children.      'They're lies,' host Joy Behar said.      McCain defended them as accurate. 'Sen. Obama chooses his  words very carefully. He shouldn't have said it,' McCain said  of the lipstick comment.

      "Text": "    April 25 (Reuters) - Britain will mark the 40th anniversary  of the day the Abortion Act came into force on April 28, 1968.      Studies by the Guttmacher Institute and the World Health  Organisation, published last October, show the number of  abortions worldwide fell to less than 42 million in 2003 from 46  million in 1995.      Here is an overview of the abortion law in some countries:      UNITED KINGDOM - Abortion has been legal in Britain since  1968 for pregnancies up to 24 weeks. The British law does not  apply to Northern Ireland, which retains many restrictions on  abortion.      CHINA - The world's most populous country with 1.2 billion  people, China limits most families to one child and encourages  abortion as a way of controlling population growth.      INDIA - With a population of more than 1 billion, India  allows abortion within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy if a  qualified doctor says it is necessary to save the mother's life.      -- If the pregnancy is more than 12 weeks but less than 20,  two registered medical practitioners must agree an abortion is  necessary. The written consent of the woman, or of the guardian  if the woman is under 18 or mentally challenged, is required for  an abortion.      AUSTRALIA - Abortion is not legal in six states and two  territories, but is officially allowed if a woman's life is at  risk. Many women circumvent the law using 1960s and 1970s common  law rulings which permit abortion on social and economic  grounds. Restrictions on abortion vary by jurisdiction and women  are allowed abortion on demand in the state of Western  Australia.      EUROPE - The legal abortion period is 10 weeks in France,  Greece, Denmark, Norway and Portugal, 12 weeks in Germany,  Belgium and Austria and 22 to 24 weeks in Britain, Spain,  Switzerland and the Netherlands. Malta, Ireland and Poland still  have highly restrictive abortion laws.      ITALY - Abortion was legalised in Italy in 1978 and upheld  in a referendum in 1981. The law allows abortion on demand in  the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and until the 24th week if the  mother's life is at risk or the foetus is seriously malformed.      RUSSIA - Russia was the first country to legalise abortion  in 1920, although the law was repealed in 1936 and abortion  remained illegal until 1955. Abortion requires the consent of  the pregnant woman and should be performed by a licensed  physician in a hospital. It is allowed on request during the  first 12 weeks of pregnancy, and between 12 and 28 weeks from  conception on judicial, genetic, vital, broad medical and social  grounds, and for personal reasons with the special authorisation  of a commission of local physicians.      POLAND - The 1993 law allows abortion only if pregnancy  threatens a woman's life or health, results from rape or incest,  or if the foetus is irreparably damaged. In 1996 it was  liberalised to allow women to end a pregnancy before the 12th  week because of poverty or other social problems.      MUSLIM COUNTRIES - Islam bans the abortion of a living  foetus, but some countries like Syria allow abortion in cases  where there is a pressing medical need, such as a danger to the  mother's health.      ISRAEL - A woman may terminate a pregnancy if she is not  married, or if the pregnancy is the outcome of rape or poses  health risks. Abortions are also allowed for women younger than  17 or older than 40.      SOUTH KOREA - The law allows abortion only if the mother's  health is at r",

      "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. abortion rate has  fallen to its lowest level since 1976, with about 20 percent of  pregnancies being terminated by abortion, the nonprofit Alan  Guttmacher Institute reported on Thursday.      Its survey of all known abortion providers found the  abortion rate fell 9 percent between 2000 and 2005, probably  due to a combination of better access to contraception and less  access to abortion providers, the group said.      'Slightly more than one in five pregnancies end in  abortion, indicating that unwanted pregnancy is still too  common in the United States,' the report reads.      The report is the first snapshot since 2000 of what remains  one of the most contentious political and ethical issues in the  United States -- whether women should be able to get abortions.  While it remains legal, some states have passed laws designed  to make it more difficult to get an abortion.      'More needs to be done to help women and their partners  prevent unintended pregnancy,' a team of experts led by the  institute's Rachel Jones wrote in the report.      'For example, more women and couples need access to  resources and services that will help them to better plan when  they want to have children and how to use contraceptive methods  effectively until that time,' the report said.      'In addition, it is important to remove barriers to  abortion services -- particularly for lower income women, who  have above-average rates of unintended pregnancy.'      They used surveys from all abortion providers they could  find along with data from the U.S. Census Bureau to calculate  rates.      'An estimated 1.2 million abortions were performed in the  United States in 2005, 8 percent fewer than in 2000,' they  wrote. 'The abortion rate in 2005 was 19.4 per 1,000 women aged  15 to 44; this rate represents a 9 percent decline from 2000.'      They found that 1,787 doctors, clinics and hospitals  provide abortion, just 2 percent fewer than in 2000. But 87  percent of U.S. counties had no abortion provider, meaning  women often must travel to get one.      Women can get abortions surgically or by using a  combination of drugs to induce a miscarriage. The report found  that using the drugs accounted for 13 percent of all  abortions.      The institute, set up to study and report on reproductive  health in the United States, said no one had reported on the  abortion rate since 2000.      'Abortion is one of the most common medical procedures  undergone by women aged 15-44 in the United States, partly  because of the high level of unintended pregnancy,' Jones and  colleagues wrote.      'About half of the 6.4 million pregnancies that occurred  in 2000 (including those ending in miscarriages) were  unintended, and about half of these resulted in abortion,' they  wrote.      The researchers said the number of abortion providers  declined by about 38 percent between 1982 and 2000, but that  appeared to be leveling off.

      "Text": "    MEXICO CITY, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Mexico's Supreme Court on  Thursday upheld a law allowing abortion in the nation's  capital, in a victory for leftist city lawmakers over  conservative President Felipe Calderon's government and the  Catholic Church.      In an 8-3 vote, judges said there were no grounds to  overturn a law approved in 2007 by the Mexico City assembly  that legalized abortions on demand during the first trimester  and established free public clinics.      The landmark decision could open the door for other states  in Mexico, the world's second most populous Catholic country,  to follow the capital's lead in relaxing laws that criminalize  abortion, legal experts said.      The judges found that Mexico's constitution did not  explicitly guarantee the right to life of the fetus, and that  the interests of the unborn had to be balanced with those of  women seeking an abortion.        While Calderon stayed largely on the sidelines of the  battle, his attorney-general's office and the National Human  Rights Commission sought to reintroduce a ban on abortion.

      "Text": "    VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Sept 4 (Reuters) - A Canadian  appeals court on Thursday upheld a provincial 'bubble zone' law  that limited protests around abortion clinics in British  Columbia.      The three-judge panel rejected the claims of anti-abortion  activists and civil libertarians that the law violated rights  of free expression by stopping protesters from talking to women  entering the clinics.      'The objective of the act justifies the limited  infringement of freedom of expression in the circumstances,'  British Columbia Court of Appeals justice Catherine Anne Ryan  wrote in the unanimous ruling.      The law passed in 1995 created a 50-meter zone around  abortion clinics in which protests against the facilities were  not allowed. Its supporters argue it is needed to protect  patients and medical staff.      Two western Canadian anti-abortion activists, Donald Spratt  and Gordon Watson, violated the law in 1998 outside the  Everywoman's Health Clinic in an effort to have the law struck  down by the courts.      The men argued unsuccessfully that protection zone was too  large and that even if it had been needed at the time it was  enacted it was no longer necessary because the tone of  anti-abortion protests had changed.

      "Text": "    SYDNEY, March 10 (Reuters) - Queensland Reds loose forward  John Roe has been replaced as captain by scrumhalf Sam  Cordingley, coach Phil Mooney said on Monday.      'John Roe has held the side together through the tough times  and carried a larger share of the burden than should reasonably  be asked of any single player,' Mooney said in a statement.      'We have taken this difficult decision now because we  believe it can help re-focus John and the team in their pursuit  of success in 2008.'       Queensland have won just one of their four Super 14 games  this season.      'Phil and I discussed it this morning and agreed that a  change of leadership was in the best interests of the team,' Roe  said.      'It has been a great honour to captain Queensland and I look  forward to continuing to serve the team and Queensland rugby in  whatever capacity I can.'      Roe has played 101 games for the Reds and captained the side  for the previous three seasons. He replaced Elton Flatley in the  job in 2005 when the former Wallaby centre was forced to retire  through injury and stand-in captain Nathan Sharpe said he was  leaving the side to play for the Western Force.

      "Text": "    By Ben Harding      MADRID, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Spanish abortion clinics began a  week-long strike on Tuesday, criticising the government for what  they said was harassment since a series of police raids on  Barcelona centres accused of illegal abortions.      More than 1,000 women will be unable to have an abortion  this week after 31 private clinics shut their doors to all cases  except for those when the mother's health was at risk, said a  spokeswoman for abortion clinic association ACAI. The 31 clinics  performed most of Spain's 101,592 abortions in 2006, ACAI said.      Late last year Barcelona police arrested 13 people, many of  them gynaecologists and anaesthetists, in raids against clinics  accused of performing illegal, late-term abortions.      ACAI spokeswoman Francisca Garcia said the government had  increased intrusive inspections against its members even though  none of its members were involved in the raids. Spain's health  minister had ignored requests for talks, she said.      Spain's health ministry was not immediately available to  comment on the accusation.      'We think the number and manner of inspections is abusive,'  Garcia said, adding that so many inspections, three times the  norm in some clinics, violated the privacy of patients and was a  slur on the professionalism of staff.      Spain decriminalised abortion in 1985, 10 years after the  death of conservative dictator Francisco Franco, but while the  number of abortions has doubled in the last decade, the practice  is controversial in the traditionally Catholic country.      Abortion is only permitted in certain cases, for example up  to 12 weeks for women who have been raped or up to 22 weeks if a  foetus is malformed. It is also available if a birth poses a  psychological risk to the mother.      One of those detained in the raids was Peruvian doctor  Carlos Morin, who was shown in a television programme appearing  to offer an abortion to an undercover Danish journalist who was  eight months pregnant in return for 4,000 euros.      The police findings triggered indignation in conservative  media.      But some members of the governing Socialist Party said  abortion laws should be further liberalised. Prime Minister Jose  Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, facing a tight contest in March general  elections, rejected this.      Last month the windows of a clinic in Madrid were smashed by  masked attackers and staff across Spain have reported a rise in  threats against them, Garcia said.      'After 22 years of exercising this right a shadow of doubt  has started to appear over our professionalism,' she said.

      "Text": "  (Adds protest, Church response, details)      By Michael O'Boyle      MEXICO CITY, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Mexico's Supreme Court on  Thursday upheld a law allowing abortion in the capital, handing  a victory to leftist city lawmakers over conservative President  Felipe Calderon's government and the Roman Catholic Church.      In an 8-3 vote, judges said there were no grounds to  overturn a law approved in 2007 by the Mexico City assembly  that legalized abortions on demand during the first trimester  and established free public clinics.      The bells of the cathedral in the capital's historic Zocalo  square pealed in mourning.      The court's ruling was applauded by women's rights  advocates, who have campaigned for decades to legalize abortion  in the world's second most-populous Catholic country.      The landmark decision could open the door for other states  in Mexico to follow the capital's lead in relaxing laws that  criminalize abortion, legal experts said.      'This is a triumph of the recognition of women's  fundamental rights,' said Maria Luisa Sanchez, director of  abortion rights advocacy group GIRE. 'It will surely establish  a precedent for Mexico, for the other states and for the region  of Latin America.'      A small group of young anti-abortion activists gathered  outside the court, chanting 'Yes To Life. No To Abortion.'      'No court can contradict the supreme law of God that orders  us: thou shalt not kill,' Mexico's top Catholic churchman,  Cardinal Norberto Rivera, said in a statement.      Church leaders had initially threatened to excommunicate  city officials belonging to the leftist Party of the Democratic  Revolution who sponsored the law.           'LAW OF GOD'      The court's ruling was a political boost for Mexico City's  leftist mayor, Marcelo Ebrard, who is grooming himself for a  possible presidential bid in 2012.      Ebrard has supported a series of measures that have angered  church leaders, including gay civil unions and a statute  allowing the terminally ill to refuse treatment.      In their ruling, the judges found that Mexico's  constitution did not explicitly guarantee the right to life of  the fetus, and that the interests of the unborn had to be  balanced with those of women seeking an abortion.      Abortion is currently only allowed outside the capital   under special circumstances, such as in the case of rape or  when the woman's life is in danger. Pro-abortion campaigners  complain that some doctors in public hospitals in Mexico City  have refused to carry out abortions despite the law.      While Calderon stayed largely on the sidelines of the  battle, his attorney-general and the National Human Rights  Commission sought to reintroduce a ban on abortion.      Last month, a congressional committee in Brazil voted down  a bill that would have legalized abortion in the world's most  populous Catholic country.      The leftist government in Ecuador is attempting to pass a  new constitution that Church leaders claim could pave the way  toward legalizing abortion.

      "Text": "    By Catherine Hornby      AMSTERDAM, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Portugal violated the right to  freedom of expression when it deployed a warship to prevent a  Dutch ship with an abortion clinic on board from entering its  waters in 2004, the European Court of Human Rights said.      Portugal, which lifted restrictions on abortion in 2007,  barred the ship operated by the Dutch Women on Waves  organisation on the basis of maritime and health laws and  imposed a naval blockade to keep it out of its domestic waters.      The court said on Tuesday that while it recognised  Portugal's aims to prevent disorder and protect health, it  concluded that the right to freedom of expression was violated  because the reaction was disproportionate to the aims pursued.      It highlighted 'the deterrent effect for freedom of  expression in general of such a radical act as dispatching a  warship'. Authorities could have resorted to other means such as  seizing the medicines on board the Dutch ship, it said.      The Portuguese Foreign Ministry was not available for  comment. The Socialist government eased abortion laws in 2007,  allowing pregnancies to be terminated in the first 10 weeks.      Women on Waves operates an on-board clinic to offer an  abortion pill in international waters to women in countries  where terminations are illegal or restricted.      At the time of its voyage to Portugal, abortion was legal in  the traditionally Catholic country only when the mother's life  was in danger and in a few other specific cases.      Women on Waves, which says a woman dies every eight minutes  due to an illegal abortion, had planned the visit to Portugal to  give information and sexual education and encourage a change to  the abortion laws, it said in a statement after the ruling.      It has sailed to other European countries with restrictive  abortion laws such as Ireland and Poland and in 2008 it also  campaigned in Ecuador in South America.

      "Text": "    WASHINGTON, May 20 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court   ruled on Tuesday that a Virginia law banning an abortion  procedure was unconstitutional because it infringed on a  woman's right to end her pregnancy.      The 2-1 decision by the appeals court based in Richmond,  Virginia, was a victory for abortion rights advocates who had  challenged the 2003 law that bans what it terms 'partial birth  infanticide.'      The U.S. Supreme Court last year upheld a federal law, the  Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, saying it prohibited only a  clearly defined method. It marked the first time the court has  ever upheld a nationwide ban on a specific abortion procedure.      But the appeals court ruled the Virginia law was  substantially broader than the federal law and must be struck  down because it would burden a woman's right to choose an  abortion as early as the second trimester of pregnancy.      While the federal law protected doctors who set out to  perform a legal abortion that by accident becomes the banned  procedure, the Virginia law provided no such protection, the  appeals court said.      Both sides in the case agreed that the Virginia law bans a  medical procedure called 'intact dilation and extraction.'      Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive  Rights in New York, which brought the challenge to the law,  hailed the ruling.      'Federal courts are seeing through these thinly veiled  attempts to undermine a woman's ability to obtain an abortion,'  she said in a statement, noting that a federal appeals court  last year struck down a broad Michigan abortion ban.      Critics had charged the Virginia law, which has never taken  effect, was one of the most restrictive abortion measures in  the country.

John McCain.      * Palin was sworn in as Alaska's youngest and first woman  governor in December 2006. Born in Sandpoint, Idaho, Feb. 11,  1964, she moved to Alaska with her parents as an infant.      * Palin is a darling of U.S. conservatives because of her  record on tax cuts, opposition to abortion and other issues.

      "Text": "    Sept 3 (Reuters) - Here are some facts about Sarah Palin,  who rose quickly from small-town mayor to one of the most  popular governors in Alaskan history before her surprise  selection as Republican John McCain's vice presidential running  mate.      * Born in Sandpoint, Idaho, on Feb. 11, 1964, she moved to  Alaska with her parents as an infant. As a star on the state  champion Wasilla High School girls' basketball team, she was  known as 'Sarah Barracuda' for her aggressive play. She  graduated in 1987 from the University of Idaho, where she  studied journalism. She worked as a sports reporter at an  Anchorage television station in 1988.      * She entered politics in 1992 by running for the city  council in Wasilla, a town outside Anchorage that then had  about 5,000 residents. She was re-elected to a second term in  1995, and became Wasilla's mayor in 1996.      * She gained statewide fame as a whistle-blower calling  attention to ethical violations by high-ranking Republican  officials in Alaska, including the chairman of the state  Republican party and was sworn in as the state's youngest and  first woman governor in December 2006.      * As governor, Palin has spoken out against corruption,  battled for funding from major oil producers and convinced the  legislature to give a $1,200 'energy rebate' to nearly every  Alaskan. Her approval rating in the state stands at 80  percent.      * Palin is under investigation by Alaska's state  legislature to determine whether she fired a public safety  commissioner after he declined to fire a state trooper who had  divorced Palin's sister. Palin has hired a private lawyer in  the probe.     * Palin married her high school sweetheart, Todd Palin, in  1988. A champion snowmachine racer, Todd Palin is a commercial  fisherman who has worked for BP and has been a production  operator in oil fields on Alaska's North Slope.     * Palin, who has five children including a son born in April  with Down Syndrome and an unmarried 17-year-old who is  pregnant, is favored by social conservatives because of her  opposition to abortion, devout Christianity and lifetime  membership in the National Rifle Association.     * In 1984, Palin won the Miss Wasilla pageant, and finished  second in the Miss Alaska pageant, at which she was named 'Miss  Congeniality.

      "Text": "     Sept 3 (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John  McCain's newly chosen running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin,  created an immediate stir with news that she is the subject of  a state ethics probe and her unmarried teenage daughter is  pregnant.      Palin will accept the nomination on Wednesday in a speech  to the Republican convention. Here are some potential scenarios  for her candidacy and its impact on the Nov. 4 presidential  election against Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama  and his No. 2, Joe Biden.      - The choice of Palin, 44, a conservative abortion rights  opponent with a record of bucking the Republican establishment  in Alaska, has rallied the conservative base to McCain, who has  struggled to win over that crucial constituency.      Her speech will give the party a chance to answer questions  about her familiarity with domestic and foreign policy issues,  and possibly address the issue of her 17-year-old daughter's  pregnancy and the investigation into whether she abused her  power in having a public safety commissioner fired in Alaska.      'She'll be greeted rapturously because the delegates are  very conservative, as is she,' University of Virginia political  analyst Larry Sabato said of her convention appearance. 'She's  become their heroine. But what the delegates think and what the  country thinks are probably two different things.'      - The selection of the political unknown has raised  questions about McCain's judgment and the degree to which his  campaign investigated Palin's background. That is a distraction  that could hurt the campaign's efforts to generate momentum for  the election battle with Obama.      'My vetting process was completely thorough and I'm  grateful for the results,' McCain told reporters in  Philadelphia.      - Palin's slot on the ticket is secure, but new revelations  or scandals from Alaska could threaten her standing. It would  take a lot, however, to dump her two months before the  election.      'If he drops her, the election is over. There's zero chance  that he'll drop her,' Sabato said.

      "Text": "Can you believe Sarah Palin is still getting trashed eight days after the election? Can you believe she's still getting as much or more attention than President-elect Obama? Something is going on here.\n\nWednesday, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd ran yet another analysis of Governor Palin. But why? She lost. She's not going to be vice president.\n\nIn her column just out, she wrote: \"After her brutal transformation by the McCain campaign into a shopaholic, whack-job diva, Palin is now trying to unmake that makeover and morph from uptown cloistered girl back to down-home accessible girl.\"\n\nMs. Dowd goes on to cite reporting by The Washington Post that the governor spent even more money, this time on silk boxer shorts for her husband and spray tanners, above and beyond the original $150,000 already reported.\n\nNow, my question is: Who cares? I believe Palin when she says the RNC bought the clothes.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGOV. SARAH PALIN: The criticism that, you know, I took time out to run into Neiman Marcus or Sax, I don't think I've ever set foot in either one of those stores and, of course, didn't know the New York stylist whom they had hired or anything else.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWell, \"Talking Points\" is simply amazed the press is still talking about this in the face of a dangerous economy and the anticipation of a relatively inexperienced new president.\n\nBut there are some lessons here, and the first one is about loyalty. After Sarah Palin was hammered by some McCain staffers, it took the senator six days before he publicly stood up for her. That happened on the Leno program last night.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: I'm just very proud to have had Sarah Palin and her family, a wonderful family.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOK, but let me ask you something. If you knew a friend was being humiliated, would it take you six days to defend her? If so, you're not much of a friend.\n\nOn \"The Radio Factor\" Wednesday, Juan Williams said he thinks McCain just doesn't care about the issue, and that rings true. But McCain should have stood up sooner, no question.\n\nAs for Governor Palin, the liberal press wants to destroy her mainly because of her pro-life belief. And some Republicans believe she's not smart enough to run the country. So she continues to get it from both sides.\n\nBut the very fact that we are still talking about Sarah Palin proves the woman remains a force in America. It will be fascinating to see what happens to her.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nOur pal Donald Trump often does some nice things with his assets, and here's another one. He's been housing actress Jennifer Hudson and her family after the brutal murders of her mother, brother and young nephew. Mr. Trump's putting them up for free at one of his hotels, and for that, he's a patriot.\n\nOn the pinhead front, actor Brad Garrett, who gained a measure of fame in \"Everybody Loves Raymond,\" is being investigated by the police after this confrontation:\n\nClick here to watch \"Pinheads & Patriots.\"\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're a big star, man.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, leave him alone.\n\nBRAD GARRETT, ACTOR: That's enough. That's enough.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I didn't touch you.\n\nGARRETT: Oh, you would love that, right.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You did.\n\nGARRETT: Oh, did I really? Go get a real job.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nNow, we sympathize with all famous people because the paparazzi are ruthless. But Mr. Garrett needs to calm down and stop being a pinhead.",

      "Text": " (Adds dropped word in 2nd paragraph)      Sept 2 (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John  McCain's newly chosen running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin,  created an immediate stir with news that she is the subject of  a state ethics probe and her unmarried teenage daughter is  pregnant.      Palin will accept the nomination on Wednesday in a speech  to the Republican convention. Here are some potential scenarios  for her candidacy and its impact on the Nov. 4 presidential  election against Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama  and his No. 2, Joe Biden.      - The choice of Palin, 44, a conservative abortion rights  opponent with a record of bucking the Republican establishment  in Alaska, has rallied the conservative base to McCain, who has  struggled to win over that crucial constituency.      Her speech will give the party a chance to answer questions  about her familiarity with domestic and foreign policy issues,  and possibly address the issue of her 17-year-old daughter's  pregnancy and the investigation into whether she abused her  power in having a public safety commissioner fired in Alaska.      'She'll be greeted rapturously because the delegates are  very conservative, as is she,' University of Virginia political  analyst Larry Sabato said of her convention appearance. 'She's  become their heroine. But what the delegates think and what the  country thinks are probably two different things.'      - The selection of the political unknown has raised  questions about McCain's judgment and the degree to which his  campaign investigated Palin's background. That is a distraction  that could hurt the campaign's efforts to generate momentum for  the election battle with Obama.      'My vetting process was completely thorough and I'm  grateful for the results,' McCain told reporters in  Philadelphia.      - Palin's slot on the ticket is secure, but new revelations  or scandals from Alaska could threaten her standing. It would  take a lot, however, to dump her two months before the  election.      'If he drops her, the election is over. There's zero chance  that he'll drop her,' Sabato said.

      "Text": "Wednesday morning, NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell reported that Governor Palin's clothing is very expensive, and Ms. Mitchell is apparently upset about that. It's the usual from NBC News, trying to diminish the McCain-Palin ticket any way they can.\n\nBut far more troubling \u2014 far more troubling \u2014 was an interview Tuesday on CNN. Stay with me here because this is very important.\n\nWriting in the National Review this week, Byron York said: \"Watching press coverage of the Republican candidate for vice president, it's sometimes hard to decide whether Sarah Palin is incompetent, stupid, unqualified, corrupt, backward, or all of the above. Palin, the governor of Alaska, has faced more criticism than any vice presidential candidate since 1988.\"\n\nNow Mr. York was clearly criticizing press bias in that paragraph, no question about that. Well, shortly after the article appeared, Sarah Palin was interviewed by CNN reporter Drew Griffin, and here's what happened:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDREW GRIFFIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Governor, you've been mocked in the press. The press has been pretty hard on you. The Democrats have been pretty hard on you. But also some conservatives have been pretty hard on you as well. The National Review had a story saying that, you know, I can't tell if Sarah Palin is incompetent, stupid, unqualified, corrupt, or all of the above.\n\nSARAH PALIN: Who wrote that one?\n\nGRIFFIN: That was in the National Review. I don't have the author.\n\nPALIN: I'd like to talk to that person.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nShe doesn't have to talk to that person. Isn't that incredible?\n\nNow Griffin, the guy, totally distorted what York wrote in the article, and then he ambushes Palin with the distortion. She has no idea what he's talking about.\n\nNow I haven't been critical of CNN during the campaign. They've been pretty honest in their coverage, I believe. But that was off the chart dishonest.\n\nSo we called CNN for comment very early in the morning. We said look, you know, are you going to apologize? What are you going to do? They wouldn't comment. Apparently, there's no apology in the works, no retraction. It's unbelievable. It's hard to believe. In fact, the whole campaign has been hard to believe.\n\n\"Talking Points\" is amazed at how dishonest the American press reportage has been. Yes, there's been nasty stuff from both sides, no doubt. But with the mainstream media solidly behind Barack Obama, I think that's worth about five percentage points for him in the popular vote. I could be wrong.\n\nBut CNN was definitely wrong in what they did to Sarah Palin. It's outrageous.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nAs you may have heard, I signed up for another contract cycle here at FOX News. My boss, Roger Ailes, is a patriot for allowing me to continue. At least to me he is.\n\nNow I gave two interviews Tuesday on the subject: one to Richard Huff at the New York Daily News and the other to our pal Howard Kurtz at The Washington Post.\n\nNow, I'm like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football with Lucy holding it. I'm never going to learn.\n\nHuff did a fair story, but he listed my salary, which he got drastically wrong. But it doesn't matter. All the Web sites picked it up and, once again, falsehood becomes fact.\n\nKurtz wrote mostly about some negative aspects of \"The Factor,\" which is what The Post likes to do. Howard didn't do anything unprofessional. He simply gave his bosses what they want: negative stuff.\n\nFor example, Kurtz wrote that \"The Radio Factor\" is less successful than the TV \"Factor.\" Well, most media, Howard, is less successful than the TV \"Factor,\" including The Washington Post and CNN, where you work.\n\nThe fact is, \"The Radio Factor\" is one of the most profitable radio franchises in the history of the medium, but Howard wanted to find a negative, and he did. By the way, as I said, Howard also works for CNN.\n\nI'm not calling Mr. Huff and Mr. Kurtz pinheads. They don't deserve that designation off what they wrote, but both men could have done a little bit better on this one.\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads & Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

      "Text": "  (Updates with more opinion polls)      By Jeff Mason      ALBUQUERQUE, Sept 8 (Reuters) - John McCain's backers are  reveling in the crowds his White House campaign has drawn in  the 10 days since he made Alaska's little-known governor, Sarah  Palin, his running mate.      'Governor, you're a breath of fresh air,' Ken Starrs, a    police lieutenant from Corpus Christi, Texas, told Palin, 44,  at a Detroit ceremony where the political pair picked up an  endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police union.      'She's very real,' he said after they shook hands.      Critics have questioned the 72-year-old Republican  senator's judgment in choosing a vice presidential candidate  without high-profile experience. Palin has been governor since  2006. Her previous public service was as a small-town mayor.      Democrat Barack Obama, 47, has raised far more cash in the  race for the Nov. 4 election. He has sought to paint McCain as  heir to Republican President George W. Bush's unpopular  policies. But McCain and Palin are holding their own.      Five public opinion polls released on Monday showed McCain  and Obama essentially dead even as they headed into the final  eight weeks of the race for the White House.      McCain has decided to keep Palin with him on the trail a  few more days before sending her out to campaign on her own.      'I saw a new McCain today, and I'm very excited,' said  Bonnie Norris, 63, after a lively performance by the Arizona  senator in Albuquerque. 'He's opened up more. He's more  dynamic.'      Some 15,000 people turned out to see McCain name his vice  presidential pick in Dayton, Ohio, on Aug. 29. To soaring music  and high drama, Palin entered the stage with her family like a  new, if somewhat baffled, rock star.           'SARAH, SARAH'      Not known for the inspiring oratory that is Obama's  trademark, McCain has since soaked up some of the energy  generated by Palin, who is greeted with shouts of 'Sarah,  Sarah' at most rallies.      'She's ignited America,' McCain declared in New Mexico on  Saturday night. 'The response to her has been overwhelming.'      At the Albuquerque rally, which packed more than 6,000  people into a tight hall, McCain's 'Straight Talk Express' bus  pulled up and dropped the candidates in front of the crowd  while Van Halen's song 'Right Now' blasted over loudspeakers.      The many signs ranged from 'Sarah, you had USA at hello' to  'Lipstick wearing pitbulls for McCain,' a reference to her quip  at the Republican convention suggesting lipstick was the only  thing to distinguish a pit bull from a 'hockey mom.'      Aides said their relationship was cementing quickly.      'They knew each other a little (before), obviously, but  they're getting to know each other well,' said Mark Salter,  McCain's closest aide and speechwriter.      'They're very excited about these rallies. They're talking  about them, they're looking at each other for marks. You know,  they're talking to each other about policy, about energy policy  and a couple other things. They're getting along very well.'      On the day McCain introduced Palin as his running mate, she  referred to him as 'senator' and to his wife Cindy as 'Mrs.  McCain.' Do they call each other by first names now? 'Yeah, I  believe so,' Salter said.      Palin, who precedes him now at rallies with a rousing  reference to McCain's service as a Vietnam prisoner of war,  added a new bit to her introduction on Friday in Michigan: 'I  am honored ",

      "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Sept 18 (Reuters Life!) - From Sarah Palin's  trademark Kazuo Kawasaki glasses, to gun-toting action figuresand a large pumpkin carved with her face, the newcomer in the  U.S. election campaign has sparked a rush of online novelties.      Other shoppers are rushing to copy the style of the  Republican party's vice-presidential candidate ahead of the   Nov. 4 vote.      Figures show online sales of items related to Palin, the  governor of Alaska and self-described 'hockey mom', have shot  up over fivefold, overtaking sales of the election's three male  contenders, and prompting a far wider range of merchandise.      Demand may be muted for a $125 pumpkin hand-carved with  Palin's face, but Palin wigs for $75 could be more appealing  while a hockey puck featuring her photo, the U.S. flag and  reading 'Hockey Moms for Sarah Palin' is proving popular at  $15.      A piece of uneaten toast titled 'Sarah Palin on my toast! A  sign? You be the judge,' was up for sale on the online auction  site eBay, with 24 bids and one unbelievable offer of $7,100.      Karen Bard, an eBay spokeswoman, said the number of Palin  related items has surged since Republican John McCain on Aug.  29 named Palin, 44, as his running mate.      'The day after McCain popped the big question to Palin, 105  Palin items were listed on eBay. With the momentum from the  Republican National Convention, Palin items took off peaking at  554 listing in one day,' Bard said.      She said over the past 30 days on eBay, over 4,000 Palin  items have sold for an average of $5.61, with the highest item,  an autographed photo of mother-of-five Palin, getting $499.99.      A quick check found 1,500 items related to Palin for sale  on eBay, outnumbering 298 for Democratic vice-presidential  candidate Joe Biden, while Democrat Barack Obama had 4,500  items to his name and McCain 1,750.           FROM WEIRD TO WIGS      Obama and McCain can boast a vast array of books, posters,  T-shirts and badges but Bard said Palin supporters were  exercising their creative rights and freedom of speech by  listing thousands of different items, mainly to show support.      These included Sarah Palin Barbie dolls and action figures,  Palin beer Steins, T-shirts galore, and Palin thong underwear.      CafePress, an online store for independent retailers and  political merchandise, was running a graph showing sales for  Palin goods had overtaken items related to the others.      In the week ending Sept 13, her first week on the CafePress  chart, Palin items accounted for 32 percent of weekly sales,  topping McCain at 29 percent, Obama at 28 percent and Biden at  5 percent.      But it is not just the bizarre that is in demand. Followers  of fashion want the former beauty queen's looks.      Italee Optics, the U.S. distributor of Palin's rimless  frames by Japanese designer Kazuo Kawasaki, has reportedly run  out of supplies after orders soared and has increased imports.      Shoe company Naughty Monkey has seen a similar rush for the  open-toed red shoes that Palin wore on the day she was  introduced as McCain's running mate -- and wig sellers are out  in force.      'Hair stylists across the country are being barraged by  clientele for the 'Palin Up-do' (with) women putting politics  aside to admire an elegant hairstyle,' said a spokeswoman for  Paula Young, a Massachusetts retailer of hairpieces and wigs.

      "Text": "    By Steve Holland      WASHINGTON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Love her or hate her, Sarah  Palin was a phenomenon as the Republican vice presidential  running mate to John McCain, and the question for the  self-styled moose-hunting hockey mom is: What now?      Alaska Gov. Palin, plucked from obscurity and thrust on to  the national stage to mixed reviews, was publicly cool to talk  that she might have caught the presidential bug and seek to run  against Democrat Barack Obama in 2012.      'I don't know politically where in the world I'll be then,'  she told reporters on Wednesday in Phoenix.      But her interest in playing some kind of national role was  evident from the words of McCain himself on Tuesday night in  his concession speech after he was defeated by Obama.      'We can all look forward with great interest to her future  service to Alaska, the Republican Party and our country,' he  said.      Palin, 44, drew huge crowds on the campaign trail, bigger  than McCain's. She proved to be a powerful performer in stump  speeches, energizing the Republican base.      But she was less effective in television interviews,  botching a couple of early media encounters to the point that  some prominent conservatives said she was too inexperienced to  be a heartbeat away from the presidency.      Her folksy, 'you betcha' style was both refreshing and  grist for countless jokes on late-night television, giving a  career boost to her actress doppelganger, Tina Fey of NBC's  'Saturday Night Live.'      'She clearly has a future in national politics,' said  Republican strategist Scott Reed. 'She has to work to rebuild  the parts of her image that became a caricature. But she's  extremely popular with the grassroots.'      'Palin needs to take some time back in Alaska and regroup  with her day job. There's plenty of time to plot and scheme  after the Christmas holidays,' he said.           REPUBLICAN VISIONS      While Palin was selected by McCain in 2008, if she ran in  2012 she would compete against formidable members of her own  party with their own visions like former Massachusetts Gov.  Mitt Romney, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Louisiana  Gov. Bobby Jindal.      Republican strategist Tony Fabrizio said Palin is not the  frontrunner for the Republican nomination in 2012. He noted in  particular some revelations uncovered by the news media during  what amounted to a public vetting of her record once she was  picked by McCain.      Her acceptance of thousands of dollars in daily travel  expenses from the state while living at home and the Republican  Party's costly shopping spree to equip her and her family with  designer clothing may come back to haunt her.      'She needs to go back home and face all of the stuff that's  been raked up in the presidential race. Voters in Alaska found  out a lot of stuff about Sarah Palin that they didn't know  about Sarah Palin. She's got to go back and get herself  re-elected,' Fabrizio said.      Palin's future may depend on how the Republican Party  itself changes in response to its defeat.      Social conservatives who are warmest to Palin represent a  dwindling minority in the party, which was rocked by the Obama  victory and will now undergo a period of reflection and  soul-searching about the future.      Palin was said to have little time for people who did not  agree with her socially conservative views.      'If she wants to be a voice for a part of the new failed  Republican Party, she's going",

      "Text": "    By Sue Zeidler      LOS ANGELES, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Sarah Palin represents  many things Hollywood liberals love to hate, from her  opposition to gay marriage to her support for gun rights, yet  she possesses two key qualities they admire -- star appeal and  a great script.      Accordingly, Hollywood Republicans -- often overshadowed by  their left-leaning peers -- are seeking to capitalize on the  celebrity of John McCain's running mate in the Nov. 4 election  to generate support in a town well-known for its lavish  Democratic fund-raisers and events.      'She's certainly got star appeal and is the kind of  candidate that is made for Hollywood. I offered to throw her a  fundraiser myself,' said MGM chief Harry Sloan, one of  Hollywood's most vocal Republicans.      Palin has shaken up the White House race, boosted  enthusiasm among previously apathetic supporters of McCain's  presidential nomination and drawn support from women, rural  voters and Southerners, according to recent polls.      Sloan said there were no plans for a Palin Hollywood  fundraiser yet as her campaign managers were inundated with  similar requests from all over the country after her national  debut at the Republican National Convention on Sept. 3.      A campaign spokesman would not disclose McCain and Palin's  movements beyond one week's time, but various Hollywood  executives said they heard the Arizona senator and Alaska  governor would be swinging through California later this month  or early next month.      Democratic candidates have long enjoyed a fundraising  advantage in Hollywood. Through the end of July, Democratic  presidential nominee Barack Obama raised $5.2 million from the  entertainment industry, compared with McCain's $885,000,  according to the Center for Responsive Politics.      'It's like 10 to 1 here in terms of performing artists who  support Obama versus McCain. There are a significant group of  Republican supporters in Hollywood, but they're just not as  outspoken,' said political analyst Allan Hoffenblum.        PERSONAL STORY      Hollywood is aligning again for Obama on Sept. 16 when  Barbra Streisand will sing at a Beverly Hills event expected to  raise as much as $9 million.      While some Hollywood political watchers see Palin helping  to mobilize greater celebrity support around Obama, they said  filmmakers, producers and other entertainment executives were  fascinated by the personal story of McCain's running mate,  including her 'hockey mom' persona and passion for hunting.      'These people are interested in drama, and Sarah Palin, a  pistol-packing mother of five, is clearly an interesting  character. Politically, they may not agree with Sarah Palin but  they are intrigued,' said Joel Fox, a political analyst.      Long-time Democrat Dan Glickman, chairman of the Motion  Picture Association of America, attended the Republican  National Convention. 'It's important to show our organization  has allies in both camps. Our issues are bi-partisan,' said  Glickman.      'The question is does she become a bigger draw than McCain?  It's too early to draw any conclusions,' he said.      Palin's arrival is encouraging to Hollywood conservatives  like Robert Davi, who stars in director David Zucker's upcoming  'An American Carol,' a spoof about a liberal filmmaker who  wanted to abolish the July 4 Independence Day holiday.      'A lot of times, conservative guys on the set feel  intimidated and unable to speak their view,' said Da",

      "Text": "    Oct 2 (Reuters) - Republican vice presidential candidate  Sarah Palin debates her Democratic rival, Joe Biden, on  Thursday in their only face-off before the Nov. 4 presidential  election.      Following are some biographical details for Palin, a  little-known Alaska governor before she was chosen as John  McCain's running mate:           Age: 44      Birth date: Feb. 11, 1964      Birthplace: Sandpoint, Idaho      Education: University of Idaho      Husband: Todd Palin      Children: Two sons and three daughters      Religious affiliation: Has attended nondenominational  Wasilla Bible Church in recent years; previously attended  Wasilla Assembly of God, a Pentecostal church           Family: Palin moved to Alaska with her parents, a teacher  and school secretary, when she was an infant. She grew up in  Wasilla, a town of nearly 10,000 near Anchorage.      Palin was a member of the state champion girls basketball  team, where she earned the nickname 'Sarah Barracuda' for her  aggressive play. She was crowned Miss Wasilla in a 1982 beauty  pageant and later competed in the Miss Alaska contest.      Palin graduated in 1987 from the University of Idaho with a  degree in journalism and political science and eloped with her  high school boyfriend in 1988 to avoid the cost of a wedding.      The couple have five children -- two sons and three  daughters. The eldest son, Track, deployed to Iraq with the  U.S. Army in September. The youngest, son Trig, was born in  April with Down syndrome.           Career: After her graduation and marriage, Palin worked as  a television sports reporter from 1987 to 1989. She also worked  in the family's commercial fishing business and was the owner  of a snowmobile, watercraft and all-terrain vehicle business.           Elective office/public service: Palin was elected to the  Wasilla City Council in 1992. She served two terms on the  council and was elected mayor for two terms. She gained the  attention of Republican Party officials by promoting growth and  cutting property taxes.      Palin ran for lieutenant governor in 2002 but lost. After  actively campaigning for the Republican ticket under Frank  Murkowski, she was appointed to the panel that regulates the  state's oil and gas industry.      Palin established herself as a party outsider by promoting  a pipeline project opposed by Murkowski. She ran against the  governor in 2006, defeated him in the primary and then defeated  a former Democratic governor in the general election.      As governor she has worked on ethics reform, sought to  reduce state spending and promoted a deal that would offer $500  million in seed money for the construction of a natural gas  pipeline.      She ignited a controversy by firing the state's respected  top police officer. He charged he was dismissed for resisting  pressure from the governor's office to lay off a state trooper  who was involved in a bitter divorce and custody dispute with  Palin's sister. The state Legislature is investigating the  incident.

Sarah Palin  suggested in an interview broadcast on Monday that she might  run for higher office in 2012 if the right opportunity presents  itself.

'If there is an open door in '12 or four years later, and  if it is something that is going to be good for my family, for  my state, for my nation, an opportunity for me, then I'll plow  through that door,' Palin said.

      "Text": "    By Jill Serjeant      LOS ANGELES, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Sarah Palin steps into the  lion's den of political satire on Saturday with an appearance on  the comedy show that has mocked the Republican vice-presidential  candidate and helped shape the national debate.      Palin's appearance on 'Saturday Night Live' follows a series  of dead-on impersonations of her by comedian Tina Fey that have  sent ratings for the show soaring and become as talked about as  the Alaska governor and self-described hockey mom herself.      Actor Josh Brolin, who captures the Texas swagger and twang  of President George W. Bush in the new Oliver Stone biopic  'W.', is expected to join Palin on Saturday's show, just 17 days  before the Nov. 4 election.      'I just want to be there to show Americans that we will  rise above the political shots that we take because we're in  this serious business for serious challenges that are facing  the good American people right now,' Palin told Neal Boortz,  talking about the forthcoming SNL appearance on his syndicated  radio show on Friday.      It was not clear whether Fey, the Emmy-award winning star  of the TV show '30 Rock' and the movie 'Baby Mama', will  reprise her own turn as Palin. Fey's three skits have boosted  'Saturday Night Live' ratings by 50 percent in the past month  and attracted more than 38 million viewings live or online.      Fey's impersonations have included an 'I can see Russia from  my house' joke skewering what critics see as Palin's lack of  foreign policy knowledge, and a flute-toting bid for a 'talent  portion' during the vice presidential debate that played on  critics' charges that Palin, a one-time beauty pageant contestant,  is too shallow for the vice presidency.      The skits have capped a political season in which comedy has  played an influential role.      Palin was a surprise pick by Republican presidential candidate  John McCain in August as his running mate, and has been a big hit  with conservative Christians who admire her no-nonsense, folksy  style. But the choice has been derided by supporters of Democratic  candidate Barack Obama, thanks in part to the Fey skits.      'I would expect that the McCain campaign would be much happier  if Tina Fey wasn't so popular with her impersonation of Sarah  Palin,' Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at the  University of Southern California, told Reuters.      'It does shape the public perception of Sarah Palin,' Jeffe  said.      Democrats Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden have also been  lampooned on SNL, and both Obama and McCain have appeared on the  show during the long presidential campaign.           GOING WHERE OTHERS DON'T TREAD      Satirical news shows like 'The Colbert Report' and Jon  Stewart's 'The Daily Show' along with jokes by late night chat  show hosts David Letterman and Jay Leno have gone where  straight news reporting has often feared to tread, according to  Robert Thompson, professor of media and popular culture at  Syracuse University.      'We are in a period now that journalists are afraid of  being accused of picking on people. Comedy is not only  influential but lately it has become an important part of the  U.S. civic conversation,' Thompson said.      'What Jon Stewart and Tina Fey are doing is not only  hysterically funny, but they really have used comedy to make us  ask questions about the things we should be thinking about.'

      "Text": "    Aug 29, (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John  McCain has chosen Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice  presidential running mate, a campaign official said on Friday.      The choice of the 44-year-old mother of five adds youth and  executive experience to the Republican ticket headed by the  72-year-old Arizona senator, who would be the oldest person to  assume the presidency if he is elected Nov. 4.      The choice of Palin adds a woman and a strong pro-life  voice to the Republican campaign, but her youth, limited  governmental experience and lack of exposure nationally could  be weaknesses for the ticket.      Following are some facts and figures about Palin:      * Palin was sworn in as Alaska's youngest and first woman  governor in December 2006. Born in Sandpoint, Idaho, Feb. 11,  1964, she moved to Alaska with her parents as an infant.      * Palin is a darling of U.S. conservatives because of  record on tax cuts, opposition to abortion and other issues.  Her place on the ticket may help shore up McCain with the  Republican Party's Christian base.      * Before her election as governor two years ago, she served  on the Wasilla City Council and as mayor of the town. She was  later appointed to the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation  Commission, where she learned about the state's energy  industry.      * Like McCain she has a maverick streak. She has taken on  big oil companies in Alaska and has broken ranks with the local  Republican establishment.      * 'The oil companies have been hugely influential in  Alaska, certainly over the last decade and a half with the  prior two administrations ... (For) Alaskans, as owners of the  resource ... it is time to embrace our sovereignty,' she told  Reuters in an interview a few months ago.      * Palin is a devout Christian who is opposed to abortion  rights. She is also an avid hunter and angler and a member of  the National Rifle Association, a powerful conservative lobby  that is staunchly opposed to gun control.      * She has irked environmentalists by opposing the listing  of the polar bear as a threatened species and is a big  supporter of oil and gas drilling off the Alaska coast.      * Palin, who grew up in Wasilla, near Anchorage, studied  journalism and political science at the University of Idaho.  She worked in a commercial fishing business with her husband  and as a television sportscaster before entering politics.      * Palin gave birth to her fifth child, a son, in April,  becoming the second U.S. governor to have a baby while serving  in office.

Sarah Palin, plans to remain on the  U.S. national political scene, ABC News reported on Wednesday.      Asked about 2012, whether she was discouraged by daily  attacks on the campaign trail and whether she would return home  to Alaska, the Republican vice presidential nominee signaled  that she expects to be a player in the next presidential  election cycle.     'I think that, if I were to give up and wave a white flag of  surrender against some of the political shots that we've taken  ... I'm not doing this for naught,' Palin told ABC News in a  taped interview airing on Thursday.      With less than a week before Election Day, Palin said she  believes in the current Republican presidential ticket and that  she thinks 'it's going to go our way on Tuesday, Nov. 4.'      'I truly believe that the wisdom of the people will be  revealed on that day,' she said.      Palin has energized the Republican base of supporters. But  the Alaska governor has come under withering criticism on a  variety of issues, including whether she is qualified to become  vice president.

      "Text": "    By Richard Valdmanis      TORONTO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. vice presidential hopeful  Sarah Palin fell prey to a Canadian prankster on Saturday when  he called her impersonating French President Nicolas Sarkozy  and got her to accept an invitation to hunt baby seals.      In an over-the-top French accent, a member of the Quebec  comedy duo 'The Masked Avengers,' famous for tricking  celebrities and politicians including Sarkozy himself, asked if  Palin would take him on a hunting trip by helicopter, and then  in French said they could also go kill baby seals.      An apparently oblivious Palin said she thought that would  be fun. 'We could have a lot of fun together as we're getting  work done. We could kill two birds with one stone that way.'      The prankster also got Palin, Republican John McCain's  running mate in Tuesday's U.S. presidential election, to reveal  a potential ambition for the top job in Washington.      Asked if she would like to eventually become president, the  Alaska governor responded, 'Well, maybe in eight years.'      Palin's office quickly admitted they were hoodwinked.      'Governor Palin was mildly amused to learn that she had  joined the ranks of heads of state, including President  Sarkozy, and other celebrities in being targeted by these  pranksters. C'est la vie,' Palin spokeswoman Tracy Schmitt said  in an e-mail.      During the phone call, which was played for a Montreal  radio program, Palin complimented the fake Sarkozy on his  beautiful wife, Carla Bruni, and asked him to give her a 'big  hug' for her.      'You added a lot of energy to your country with that  beautiful family of yours,' Palin said.      The prankster responded by complimenting Palin on a  notorious Hustler porn film 'Nailin' Paylin,' which he said was  a documentary of her life.      'Oh good, thank you,' Palin said.      Palin also reassured the fake Sarkozy when he said he would  not want to bring Vice President Dick Cheney on a hunting trip.  Cheney once accidentally shot a hunting partner.      'I'll be a careful shot,' she promised.

Sarah Palin takes the spotlight with a prime-time speech on  Wednesday that will introduce her to American voters, as  Republican John McCain's running mate joins him in his fight with  Democrat Barack Obama for the White House.      On Tuesday, President Bush saluted McCain as the man to  replace him in a brief speech by satellite to a convention  featuring assaults on Obama and a strong defense of Palin.

      "Text": "    * 'America's excited' about Palin, McCain says      * Fiorina: Obama sexist for questioning Palin experience      * Convention resumes normal business after hurricane break      * Bush, to speak via satellite, cites McCain's experience           By Steve Holland      ST. PAUL, Sept 2 (Reuters) - John McCain and his fellow  Republicans rallied behind his vice presidential pick, Sarah  Palin, on Tuesday and his campaign accused Democrat Barack  Obama of sexism for questioning her level of experience.      The support came as the Republican convention to nominate  McCain and Palin as the party's candidates was finally getting  started, after a delay due to Hurricane Gustav, with President  George W. Bush to speak via satellite hookup.      Palin's disclosure that her unmarried 17-year-old daughter  is pregnant and the news that she had hired a private lawyer in  an ethics probe in Alaska have triggered a media firestorm and  led some to question McCain's judgment and how thoroughly the  relatively unknown governor's background was examined before  she was selected last week.      In excerpts of his remarks, Bush cited McCain's national  security experience as justification for electing him on Nov. 4  over Democrat Barack Obama.      And he backed Palin on a day Palin was behind closed doors  in St. Paul preparing for an address she will give to the  convention on Wednesday.      The McCain camp issued a photo of Palin meeting Bush's  wife, Laura, and McCain's wife, Cindy.      'When the debates have ended, and all the ads have run, and  it is time to vote, Americans will look closely at the  judgment, the experience, and the policies of the candidates --  and they will cast their ballots for the McCain-Palin ticket,'  Bush said.      McCain predicted a warm welcome for Palin when she  addressed the convention. 'America's excited and they're going  to be even more excited once they see her tomorrow night,'  McCain told reporters in Cleveland. 'I'm very, very proud of  the impression that she's made on all of America and I'm  looking forward to serving with her.'      In Philadelphia, he defended his search. 'My vetting  process was completely thorough and I'm grateful for the  results,' McCain said.              SEXISM?      McCain's campaign fought back hard after Obama told CNN on  Monday that Palin's level of experience as a former mayor of  tiny Wasilla, Alaska, did not match his own, citing the size of  his campaign.      'My understanding is that Gov. Palin's town, Wasilla, has I  think 50 employees. We've got 2,500 in this campaign. I think  their budget is maybe $12 million dollars a year -- we have a  budget of about three times that just for the month,' Obama had  said.      McCain adviser Carly Fiorina accused him of sexism, a  charge the Obama camp faced during Democrat Hillary Clinton's  primary battle against him.      'The facts are that Sarah Palin has made more executive  decisions as a mayor and governor than Barack Obama has made in  his life,' Fiorina said.      'Because of Hillary Clinton's historic run for the  presidency and the treatment she received, American women are  more highly tuned than ever to recognize and decry sexism in  all its forms. They will not tolerate sexist treatment of Gov.  Palin,' Fiorina said.      The McCain campaign released a copy of Palin's Republican  voter registration card to rebut a report in The New York Times  that Palin was a member of the Alaskan Independence Party for  two year",

      "Text": "Can you believe Sarah Palin is still getting trashed eight days after the election? Can you believe she's still getting as much or more attention than President-elect Obama? Something is going on here.\n\nWednesday, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd ran yet another analysis of Governor Palin. But why? She lost. She's not going to be vice president.\n\nIn her column just out, she wrote: \"After her brutal transformation by the McCain campaign into a shopaholic, whack-job diva, Palin is now trying to unmake that makeover and morph from uptown cloistered girl back to down-home accessible girl.\"\n\nMs. Dowd goes on to cite reporting by The Washington Post that the governor spent even more money, this time on silk boxer shorts for her husband and spray tanners, above and beyond the original $150,000 already reported.\n\nNow, my question is: Who cares? I believe Palin when she says the RNC bought the clothes.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGOV. SARAH PALIN: The criticism that, you know, I took time out to run into Neiman Marcus or Sax, I don't think I've ever set foot in either one of those stores and, of course, didn't know the New York stylist whom they had hired or anything else.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWell, \"Talking Points\" is simply amazed the press is still talking about this in the face of a dangerous economy and the anticipation of a relatively inexperienced new president.\n\nBut there are some lessons here, and the first one is about loyalty. After Sarah Palin was hammered by some McCain staffers, it took the senator six days before he publicly stood up for her. That happened on the Leno program last night.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: I'm just very proud to have had Sarah Palin and her family, a wonderful family.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOK, but let me ask you something. If you knew a friend was being humiliated, would it take you six days to defend her? If so, you're not much of a friend.\n\nOn \"The Radio Factor\" Wednesday, Juan Williams said he thinks McCain just doesn't care about the issue, and that rings true. But McCain should have stood up sooner, no question.\n\nAs for Governor Palin, the liberal press wants to destroy her mainly because of her pro-life belief. And some Republicans believe she's not smart enough to run the country. So she continues to get it from both sides.\n\nBut the very fact that we are still talking about Sarah Palin proves the woman remains a force in America. It will be fascinating to see what happens to her.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nOur pal Donald Trump often does some nice things with his assets, and here's another one. He's been housing actress Jennifer Hudson and her family after the brutal murders of her mother, brother and young nephew. Mr. Trump's putting them up for free at one of his hotels, and for that, he's a patriot.\n\nOn the pinhead front, actor Brad Garrett, who gained a measure of fame in \"Everybody Loves Raymond,\" is being investigated by the police after this confrontation:\n\nClick here to watch \"Pinheads & Patriots.\"\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're a big star, man.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, leave him alone.\n\nBRAD GARRETT, ACTOR: That's enough. That's enough.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I didn't touch you.\n\nGARRETT: Oh, you would love that, right.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You did.\n\nGARRETT: Oh, did I really? Go get a real job.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nNow, we sympathize with all famous people because the paparazzi are ruthless. But Mr. Garrett needs to calm down and stop being a pinhead.",

      "Text": "Wednesday morning, NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell reported that Governor Palin's clothing is very expensive, and Ms. Mitchell is apparently upset about that. It's the usual from NBC News, trying to diminish the McCain-Palin ticket any way they can.\n\nBut far more troubling \u2014 far more troubling \u2014 was an interview Tuesday on CNN. Stay with me here because this is very important.\n\nWriting in the National Review this week, Byron York said: \"Watching press coverage of the Republican candidate for vice president, it's sometimes hard to decide whether Sarah Palin is incompetent, stupid, unqualified, corrupt, backward, or all of the above. Palin, the governor of Alaska, has faced more criticism than any vice presidential candidate since 1988.\"\n\nNow Mr. York was clearly criticizing press bias in that paragraph, no question about that. Well, shortly after the article appeared, Sarah Palin was interviewed by CNN reporter Drew Griffin, and here's what happened:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDREW GRIFFIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Governor, you've been mocked in the press. The press has been pretty hard on you. The Democrats have been pretty hard on you. But also some conservatives have been pretty hard on you as well. The National Review had a story saying that, you know, I can't tell if Sarah Palin is incompetent, stupid, unqualified, corrupt, or all of the above.\n\nSARAH PALIN: Who wrote that one?\n\nGRIFFIN: That was in the National Review. I don't have the author.\n\nPALIN: I'd like to talk to that person.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nShe doesn't have to talk to that person. Isn't that incredible?\n\nNow Griffin, the guy, totally distorted what York wrote in the article, and then he ambushes Palin with the distortion. She has no idea what he's talking about.\n\nNow I haven't been critical of CNN during the campaign. They've been pretty honest in their coverage, I believe. But that was off the chart dishonest.\n\nSo we called CNN for comment very early in the morning. We said look, you know, are you going to apologize? What are you going to do? They wouldn't comment. Apparently, there's no apology in the works, no retraction. It's unbelievable. It's hard to believe. In fact, the whole campaign has been hard to believe.\n\n\"Talking Points\" is amazed at how dishonest the American press reportage has been. Yes, there's been nasty stuff from both sides, no doubt. But with the mainstream media solidly behind Barack Obama, I think that's worth about five percentage points for him in the popular vote. I could be wrong.\n\nBut CNN was definitely wrong in what they did to Sarah Palin. It's outrageous.\n\nAnd that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nPinheads & Patriots\n\nAs you may have heard, I signed up for another contract cycle here at FOX News. My boss, Roger Ailes, is a patriot for allowing me to continue. At least to me he is.\n\nNow I gave two interviews Tuesday on the subject: one to Richard Huff at the New York Daily News and the other to our pal Howard Kurtz at The Washington Post.\n\nNow, I'm like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football with Lucy holding it. I'm never going to learn.\n\nHuff did a fair story, but he listed my salary, which he got drastically wrong. But it doesn't matter. All the Web sites picked it up and, once again, falsehood becomes fact.\n\nKurtz wrote mostly about some negative aspects of \"The Factor,\" which is what The Post likes to do. Howard didn't do anything unprofessional. He simply gave his bosses what they want: negative stuff.\n\nFor example, Kurtz wrote that \"The Radio Factor\" is less successful than the TV \"Factor.\" Well, most media, Howard, is less successful than the TV \"Factor,\" including The Washington Post and CNN, where you work.\n\nThe fact is, \"The Radio Factor\" is one of the most profitable radio franchises in the history of the medium, but Howard wanted to find a negative, and he did. By the way, as I said, Howard also works for CNN.\n\nI'm not calling Mr. Huff and Mr. Kurtz pinheads. They don't deserve that designation off what they wrote, but both men could have done a little bit better on this one.\n\n\u2014 You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Pinheads & Patriots\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the FOX News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

      "Text": "  (Updates with more opinion polls)      By Jeff Mason      ALBUQUERQUE, Sept 8 (Reuters) - John McCain's backers are  reveling in the crowds his White House campaign has drawn in  the 10 days since he made Alaska's little-known governor, Sarah  Palin, his running mate.      'Governor, you're a breath of fresh air,' Ken Starrs, a    police lieutenant from Corpus Christi, Texas, told Palin, 44,  at a Detroit ceremony where the political pair picked up an  endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police union.      'She's very real,' he said after they shook hands.      Critics have questioned the 72-year-old Republican  senator's judgment in choosing a vice presidential candidate  without high-profile experience. Palin has been governor since  2006. Her previous public service was as a small-town mayor.      Democrat Barack Obama, 47, has raised far more cash in the  race for the Nov. 4 election. He has sought to paint McCain as  heir to Republican President George W. Bush's unpopular  policies. But McCain and Palin are holding their own.      Five public opinion polls released on Monday showed McCain  and Obama essentially dead even as they headed into the final  eight weeks of the race for the White House.      McCain has decided to keep Palin with him on the trail a  few more days before sending her out to campaign on her own.      'I saw a new McCain today, and I'm very excited,' said  Bonnie Norris, 63, after a lively performance by the Arizona  senator in Albuquerque. 'He's opened up more. He's more  dynamic.'      Some 15,000 people turned out to see McCain name his vice  presidential pick in Dayton, Ohio, on Aug. 29. To soaring music  and high drama, Palin entered the stage with her family like a  new, if somewhat baffled, rock star.           'SARAH, SARAH'      Not known for the inspiring oratory that is Obama's  trademark, McCain has since soaked up some of the energy  generated by Palin, who is greeted with shouts of 'Sarah,  Sarah' at most rallies.      'She's ignited America,' McCain declared in New Mexico on  Saturday night. 'The response to her has been overwhelming.'      At the Albuquerque rally, which packed more than 6,000  people into a tight hall, McCain's 'Straight Talk Express' bus  pulled up and dropped the candidates in front of the crowd  while Van Halen's song 'Right Now' blasted over loudspeakers.      The many signs ranged from 'Sarah, you had USA at hello' to  'Lipstick wearing pitbulls for McCain,' a reference to her quip  at the Republican convention suggesting lipstick was the only  thing to distinguish a pit bull from a 'hockey mom.'      Aides said their relationship was cementing quickly.      'They knew each other a little (before), obviously, but  they're getting to know each other well,' said Mark Salter,  McCain's closest aide and speechwriter.      'They're very excited about these rallies. They're talking  about them, they're looking at each other for marks. You know,  they're talking to each other about policy, about energy policy  and a couple other things. They're getting along very well.'      On the day McCain introduced Palin as his running mate, she  referred to him as 'senator' and to his wife Cindy as 'Mrs.  McCain.' Do they call each other by first names now? 'Yeah, I  believe so,' Salter said.      Palin, who precedes him now at rallies with a rousing  reference to McCain's service as a Vietnam prisoner of war,  added a new bit to her introduction on Friday in Michigan: 'I  am honored ",

      "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Sept 18 (Reuters Life!) - From Sarah Palin's  trademark Kazuo Kawasaki glasses, to gun-toting action figuresand a large pumpkin carved with her face, the newcomer in the  U.S. election campaign has sparked a rush of online novelties.      Other shoppers are rushing to copy the style of the  Republican party's vice-presidential candidate ahead of the   Nov. 4 vote.      Figures show online sales of items related to Palin, the  governor of Alaska and self-described 'hockey mom', have shot  up over fivefold, overtaking sales of the election's three male  contenders, and prompting a far wider range of merchandise.      Demand may be muted for a $125 pumpkin hand-carved with  Palin's face, but Palin wigs for $75 could be more appealing  while a hockey puck featuring her photo, the U.S. flag and  reading 'Hockey Moms for Sarah Palin' is proving popular at  $15.      A piece of uneaten toast titled 'Sarah Palin on my toast! A  sign? You be the judge,' was up for sale on the online auction  site eBay, with 24 bids and one unbelievable offer of $7,100.      Karen Bard, an eBay spokeswoman, said the number of Palin  related items has surged since Republican John McCain on Aug.  29 named Palin, 44, as his running mate.      'The day after McCain popped the big question to Palin, 105  Palin items were listed on eBay. With the momentum from the  Republican National Convention, Palin items took off peaking at  554 listing in one day,' Bard said.      She said over the past 30 days on eBay, over 4,000 Palin  items have sold for an average of $5.61, with the highest item,  an autographed photo of mother-of-five Palin, getting $499.99.      A quick check found 1,500 items related to Palin for sale  on eBay, outnumbering 298 for Democratic vice-presidential  candidate Joe Biden, while Democrat Barack Obama had 4,500  items to his name and McCain 1,750.           FROM WEIRD TO WIGS      Obama and McCain can boast a vast array of books, posters,  T-shirts and badges but Bard said Palin supporters were  exercising their creative rights and freedom of speech by  listing thousands of different items, mainly to show support.      These included Sarah Palin Barbie dolls and action figures,  Palin beer Steins, T-shirts galore, and Palin thong underwear.      CafePress, an online store for independent retailers and  political merchandise, was running a graph showing sales for  Palin goods had overtaken items related to the others.      In the week ending Sept 13, her first week on the CafePress  chart, Palin items accounted for 32 percent of weekly sales,  topping McCain at 29 percent, Obama at 28 percent and Biden at  5 percent.      But it is not just the bizarre that is in demand. Followers  of fashion want the former beauty queen's looks.      Italee Optics, the U.S. distributor of Palin's rimless  frames by Japanese designer Kazuo Kawasaki, has reportedly run  out of supplies after orders soared and has increased imports.      Shoe company Naughty Monkey has seen a similar rush for the  open-toed red shoes that Palin wore on the day she was  introduced as McCain's running mate -- and wig sellers are out  in force.      'Hair stylists across the country are being barraged by  clientele for the 'Palin Up-do' (with) women putting politics  aside to admire an elegant hairstyle,' said a spokeswoman for  Paula Young, a Massachusetts retailer of hairpieces and wigs.

      "Text": "    By Steve Holland      WASHINGTON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Love her or hate her, Sarah  Palin was a phenomenon as the Republican vice presidential  running mate to John McCain, and the question for the  self-styled moose-hunting hockey mom is: What now?      Alaska Gov. Palin, plucked from obscurity and thrust on to  the national stage to mixed reviews, was publicly cool to talk  that she might have caught the presidential bug and seek to run  against Democrat Barack Obama in 2012.      'I don't know politically where in the world I'll be then,'  she told reporters on Wednesday in Phoenix.      But her interest in playing some kind of national role was  evident from the words of McCain himself on Tuesday night in  his concession speech after he was defeated by Obama.      'We can all look forward with great interest to her future  service to Alaska, the Republican Party and our country,' he  said.      Palin, 44, drew huge crowds on the campaign trail, bigger  than McCain's. She proved to be a powerful performer in stump  speeches, energizing the Republican base.      But she was less effective in television interviews,  botching a couple of early media encounters to the point that  some prominent conservatives said she was too inexperienced to  be a heartbeat away from the presidency.      Her folksy, 'you betcha' style was both refreshing and  grist for countless jokes on late-night television, giving a  career boost to her actress doppelganger, Tina Fey of NBC's  'Saturday Night Live.'      'She clearly has a future in national politics,' said  Republican strategist Scott Reed. 'She has to work to rebuild  the parts of her image that became a caricature. But she's  extremely popular with the grassroots.'      'Palin needs to take some time back in Alaska and regroup  with her day job. There's plenty of time to plot and scheme  after the Christmas holidays,' he said.           REPUBLICAN VISIONS      While Palin was selected by McCain in 2008, if she ran in  2012 she would compete against formidable members of her own  party with their own visions like former Massachusetts Gov.  Mitt Romney, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Louisiana  Gov. Bobby Jindal.      Republican strategist Tony Fabrizio said Palin is not the  frontrunner for the Republican nomination in 2012. He noted in  particular some revelations uncovered by the news media during  what amounted to a public vetting of her record once she was  picked by McCain.      Her acceptance of thousands of dollars in daily travel  expenses from the state while living at home and the Republican  Party's costly shopping spree to equip her and her family with  designer clothing may come back to haunt her.      'She needs to go back home and face all of the stuff that's  been raked up in the presidential race. Voters in Alaska found  out a lot of stuff about Sarah Palin that they didn't know  about Sarah Palin. She's got to go back and get herself  re-elected,' Fabrizio said.      Palin's future may depend on how the Republican Party  itself changes in response to its defeat.      Social conservatives who are warmest to Palin represent a  dwindling minority in the party, which was rocked by the Obama  victory and will now undergo a period of reflection and  soul-searching about the future.      Palin was said to have little time for people who did not  agree with her socially conservative views.      'If she wants to be a voice for a part of the new failed  Republican Party, she's going",

      "Text": "    By Sue Zeidler      LOS ANGELES, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Sarah Palin represents  many things Hollywood liberals love to hate, from her  opposition to gay marriage to her support for gun rights, yet  she possesses two key qualities they admire -- star appeal and  a great script.      Accordingly, Hollywood Republicans -- often overshadowed by  their left-leaning peers -- are seeking to capitalize on the  celebrity of John McCain's running mate in the Nov. 4 election  to generate support in a town well-known for its lavish  Democratic fund-raisers and events.      'She's certainly got star appeal and is the kind of  candidate that is made for Hollywood. I offered to throw her a  fundraiser myself,' said MGM chief Harry Sloan, one of  Hollywood's most vocal Republicans.      Palin has shaken up the White House race, boosted  enthusiasm among previously apathetic supporters of McCain's  presidential nomination and drawn support from women, rural  voters and Southerners, according to recent polls.      Sloan said there were no plans for a Palin Hollywood  fundraiser yet as her campaign managers were inundated with  similar requests from all over the country after her national  debut at the Republican National Convention on Sept. 3.      A campaign spokesman would not disclose McCain and Palin's  movements beyond one week's time, but various Hollywood  executives said they heard the Arizona senator and Alaska  governor would be swinging through California later this month  or early next month.      Democratic candidates have long enjoyed a fundraising  advantage in Hollywood. Through the end of July, Democratic  presidential nominee Barack Obama raised $5.2 million from the  entertainment industry, compared with McCain's $885,000,  according to the Center for Responsive Politics.      'It's like 10 to 1 here in terms of performing artists who  support Obama versus McCain. There are a significant group of  Republican supporters in Hollywood, but they're just not as  outspoken,' said political analyst Allan Hoffenblum.        PERSONAL STORY      Hollywood is aligning again for Obama on Sept. 16 when  Barbra Streisand will sing at a Beverly Hills event expected to  raise as much as $9 million.      While some Hollywood political watchers see Palin helping  to mobilize greater celebrity support around Obama, they said  filmmakers, producers and other entertainment executives were  fascinated by the personal story of McCain's running mate,  including her 'hockey mom' persona and passion for hunting.      'These people are interested in drama, and Sarah Palin, a  pistol-packing mother of five, is clearly an interesting  character. Politically, they may not agree with Sarah Palin but  they are intrigued,' said Joel Fox, a political analyst.      Long-time Democrat Dan Glickman, chairman of the Motion  Picture Association of America, attended the Republican  National Convention. 'It's important to show our organization  has allies in both camps. Our issues are bi-partisan,' said  Glickman.      'The question is does she become a bigger draw than McCain?  It's too early to draw any conclusions,' he said.      Palin's arrival is encouraging to Hollywood conservatives  like Robert Davi, who stars in director David Zucker's upcoming  'An American Carol,' a spoof about a liberal filmmaker who  wanted to abolish the July 4 Independence Day holiday.      'A lot of times, conservative guys on the set feel  intimidated and unable to speak their view,' said Da",

      "Text": "    Oct 2 (Reuters) - Republican vice presidential candidate  Sarah Palin debates her Democratic rival, Joe Biden, on  Thursday in their only face-off before the Nov. 4 presidential  election.      Following are some biographical details for Palin, a  little-known Alaska governor before she was chosen as John  McCain's running mate:           Age: 44      Birth date: Feb. 11, 1964      Birthplace: Sandpoint, Idaho      Education: University of Idaho      Husband: Todd Palin      Children: Two sons and three daughters      Religious affiliation: Has attended nondenominational  Wasilla Bible Church in recent years; previously attended  Wasilla Assembly of God, a Pentecostal church           Family: Palin moved to Alaska with her parents, a teacher  and school secretary, when she was an infant. She grew up in  Wasilla, a town of nearly 10,000 near Anchorage.      Palin was a member of the state champion girls basketball  team, where she earned the nickname 'Sarah Barracuda' for her  aggressive play. She was crowned Miss Wasilla in a 1982 beauty  pageant and later competed in the Miss Alaska contest.      Palin graduated in 1987 from the University of Idaho with a  degree in journalism and political science and eloped with her  high school boyfriend in 1988 to avoid the cost of a wedding.      The couple have five children -- two sons and three  daughters. The eldest son, Track, deployed to Iraq with the  U.S. Army in September. The youngest, son Trig, was born in  April with Down syndrome.           Career: After her graduation and marriage, Palin worked as  a television sports reporter from 1987 to 1989. She also worked  in the family's commercial fishing business and was the owner  of a snowmobile, watercraft and all-terrain vehicle business.           Elective office/public service: Palin was elected to the  Wasilla City Council in 1992. She served two terms on the  council and was elected mayor for two terms. She gained the  attention of Republican Party officials by promoting growth and  cutting property taxes.      Palin ran for lieutenant governor in 2002 but lost. After  actively campaigning for the Republican ticket under Frank  Murkowski, she was appointed to the panel that regulates the  state's oil and gas industry.      Palin established herself as a party outsider by promoting  a pipeline project opposed by Murkowski. She ran against the  governor in 2006, defeated him in the primary and then defeated  a former Democratic governor in the general election.      As governor she has worked on ethics reform, sought to  reduce state spending and promoted a deal that would offer $500  million in seed money for the construction of a natural gas  pipeline.      She ignited a controversy by firing the state's respected  top police officer. He charged he was dismissed for resisting  pressure from the governor's office to lay off a state trooper  who was involved in a bitter divorce and custody dispute with  Palin's sister. The state Legislature is investigating the  incident.

John McCain.      * Palin was sworn in as Alaska's youngest and first woman  governor in December 2006. Born in Sandpoint, Idaho, Feb. 11,  1964, she moved to Alaska with her parents as an infant.      * Palin is a darling of U.S. conservatives because of her  record on tax cuts, opposition to abortion and other issues. A  devout Christian, her place on the ticket may help shore up  McCain with the Republican Party's Christian base.      * Palin, 44, announced on Monday that her 17-year-old  unmarried daughter, Bristol, is pregnant and will keep the baby  and marry the father.      * The disclosure was made as a way to rebut rumors  circulating on liberal blog sites that Gov. Palin herself had  faked a pregnancy in order to cover up Bristol's pregnancy.      * Gov. Palin, who is staunchly anti-abortion, gave birth in  April to Trig Palin, her fifth child, a son born with Down  syndrome.      * Palin remains under investigation by Alaska's state  legislature to determine if she fired a public safety  commissioner after he declined to fire a state trooper who had  divorced Palin's sister.      * Democrats contend that Palin lacks experience to be a  heartbeat away from the presidency and say her selection  weakens McCain's argument their candidate Barack Obama, a  first-term U.S. senator, is too green to be president.

Sarah Palin  suggested in an interview broadcast on Monday that she might  run for higher office in 2012 if the right opportunity presents  itself.      Even before the Republican loss in last Tuesday's election  in which Palin was the running mate of Republican presidential  candidate John McCain, there was talk of the 44-year-old  first-term Alaska governor running for president in 2012.      'Show me where the open door is. Even if it's cracked up a  little bit, maybe I'll plow right on through that and maybe  prematurely plow through it, but don't let me miss an open  door,' Palin said in an interview on Fox News' 'On The Record'  program. She did not specify which office she might be  interested in seeking.      Palin, whose term as governor ends in two years,  said she  could not predict the future. But she said it would be 'very  exciting' to have an opportunity to serve in a greater  capacity.      'If there is an open door in '12 or four years later, and  if it is something that is going to be good for my family, for  my state, for my nation, an opportunity for me, then I'll plow  through that door,' Palin said.      As McCain's surprise pick in a hard-fought campaign against  Democrat Barack Obama, Palin attracted controversy but also a  strong following in the Republican Party's conservative base.

As a star on the state  champion Wasilla High School girls' basketball team, she was  known as 'Sarah Barracuda' for her aggressive play. She  graduated in 1987 from the University of Idaho, where she  studied journalism. She worked as a sports reporter at an  Anchorage television station in 1988.      * She entered politics in 1992 by running for the city  council in Wasilla, a town outside Anchorage that then had  about 5,000 residents. She was re-elected to a second term in  1995, and became Wasilla's mayor in 1996.      * She gained statewide fame as a whistle-blower calling  attention to ethical violations by high-ranking Republican  officials in Alaska, including the chairman of the state  Republican party and was sworn in as the state's youngest and  first woman governor in December 2006.      * As governor, Palin has spoken out against corruption,  battled for funding from major oil producers and convinced the  legislature to give a $1,200 'energy rebate' to nearly every  Alaskan. Her approval rating in the state stands at 80  percent.      * Palin is under investigation by Alaska's state  legislature to determine whether she fired a public safety  commissioner after he declined to fire a state trooper who had  divorced Palin's sister. Palin has hired a private lawyer in  the probe.     * Palin married her high school sweetheart, Todd Palin, in  1988. A champion snowmachine racer, Todd Palin is a commercial  fisherman who has worked for BP and has been a production  operator in oil fields on Alaska's North Slope.     * Palin, who has five children including a son born in April  with Down Syndrome and an unmarried 17-year-old who is  pregnant, is favored by social conservatives because of her  opposition to abortion, devout Christianity and lifetime  membership in the National Rifle Association.     * In 1984, Palin won the Miss Wasilla pageant, and finished  second in the Miss Alaska pageant, at which she was named 'Miss  Congeniality.

      "Text": "    By Jill Serjeant      LOS ANGELES, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Sarah Palin steps into the  lion's den of political satire on Saturday with an appearance on  the comedy show that has mocked the Republican vice-presidential  candidate and helped shape the national debate.      Palin's appearance on 'Saturday Night Live' follows a series  of dead-on impersonations of her by comedian Tina Fey that have  sent ratings for the show soaring and become as talked about as  the Alaska governor and self-described hockey mom herself.      Actor Josh Brolin, who captures the Texas swagger and twang  of President George W. Bush in the new Oliver Stone biopic  'W.', is expected to join Palin on Saturday's show, just 17 days  before the Nov. 4 election.      'I just want to be there to show Americans that we will  rise above the political shots that we take because we're in  this serious business for serious challenges that are facing  the good American people right now,' Palin told Neal Boortz,  talking about the forthcoming SNL appearance on his syndicated  radio show on Friday.      It was not clear whether Fey, the Emmy-award winning star  of the TV show '30 Rock' and the movie 'Baby Mama', will  reprise her own turn as Palin. Fey's three skits have boosted  'Saturday Night Live' ratings by 50 percent in the past month  and attracted more than 38 million viewings live or online.      Fey's impersonations have included an 'I can see Russia from  my house' joke skewering what critics see as Palin's lack of  foreign policy knowledge, and a flute-toting bid for a 'talent  portion' during the vice presidential debate that played on  critics' charges that Palin, a one-time beauty pageant contestant,  is too shallow for the vice presidency.      The skits have capped a political season in which comedy has  played an influential role.      Palin was a surprise pick by Republican presidential candidate  John McCain in August as his running mate, and has been a big hit  with conservative Christians who admire her no-nonsense, folksy  style. But the choice has been derided by supporters of Democratic  candidate Barack Obama, thanks in part to the Fey skits.      'I would expect that the McCain campaign would be much happier  if Tina Fey wasn't so popular with her impersonation of Sarah  Palin,' Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at the  University of Southern California, told Reuters.      'It does shape the public perception of Sarah Palin,' Jeffe  said.      Democrats Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden have also been  lampooned on SNL, and both Obama and McCain have appeared on the  show during the long presidential campaign.           GOING WHERE OTHERS DON'T TREAD      Satirical news shows like 'The Colbert Report' and Jon  Stewart's 'The Daily Show' along with jokes by late night chat  show hosts David Letterman and Jay Leno have gone where  straight news reporting has often feared to tread, according to  Robert Thompson, professor of media and popular culture at  Syracuse University.      'We are in a period now that journalists are afraid of  being accused of picking on people. Comedy is not only  influential but lately it has become an important part of the  U.S. civic conversation,' Thompson said.      'What Jon Stewart and Tina Fey are doing is not only  hysterically funny, but they really have used comedy to make us  ask questions about the things we should be thinking about.'      Thompson said Fey's skit of Palin's rambling television  intervi",

      "Text": "    Aug 29, (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John  McCain has chosen Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice  presidential running mate, a campaign official said on Friday.      The choice of the 44-year-old mother of five adds youth and  executive experience to the Republican ticket headed by the  72-year-old Arizona senator, who would be the oldest person to  assume the presidency if he is elected Nov. 4.      The choice of Palin adds a woman and a strong pro-life  voice to the Republican campaign, but her youth, limited  governmental experience and lack of exposure nationally could  be weaknesses for the ticket.      Following are some facts and figures about Palin:      * Palin was sworn in as Alaska's youngest and first woman  governor in December 2006. Born in Sandpoint, Idaho, Feb. 11,  1964, she moved to Alaska with her parents as an infant.      * Palin is a darling of U.S. conservatives because of  record on tax cuts, opposition to abortion and other issues.  Her place on the ticket may help shore up McCain with the  Republican Party's Christian base.      * Before her election as governor two years ago, she served  on the Wasilla City Council and as mayor of the town. She was  later appointed to the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation  Commission, where she learned about the state's energy  industry.      * Like McCain she has a maverick streak. She has taken on  big oil companies in Alaska and has broken ranks with the local  Republican establishment.      * 'The oil companies have been hugely influential in  Alaska, certainly over the last decade and a half with the  prior two administrations ... (For) Alaskans, as owners of the  resource ... it is time to embrace our sovereignty,' she told  Reuters in an interview a few months ago.      * Palin is a devout Christian who is opposed to abortion  rights. She is also an avid hunter and angler and a member of  the National Rifle Association, a powerful conservative lobby  that is staunchly opposed to gun control.      * She has irked environmentalists by opposing the listing  of the polar bear as a threatened species and is a big  supporter of oil and gas drilling off the Alaska coast.      * Palin, who grew up in Wasilla, near Anchorage, studied  journalism and political science at the University of Idaho.  She worked in a commercial fishing business with her husband  and as a television sportscaster before entering politics.      * Palin gave birth to her fifth child, a son, in April,  becoming the second U.S. governor to have a baby while serving  in office.

      "Text": "    LOS ANGELES, Dec 30 (Reuters) - If they had to live next  door to a celebrity, American adults would most like to be  neighbors with Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and chat show host Oprah  Winfrey.      But trouble-prone pop star Britney Spears would be the  worst celebrity neighbor, according to a survey published on   Tuesday of the most and least desirable well-known faces  Americans would have in their backyard.      Republican vice presidential candidate Palin topped the  poll of most desirable celebrity neighbors with 14 percent,  closely followed by Winfrey, who was particularly popular with  women.      Olympic champion swimmer Michael Phelps was heavily favored  by men but came in third with 9 percent overall.      Paparazzi-magnets such as Spears, actress Lindsay Lohan and  British couple David and Victoria Beckham apparently don't make  the best neighbors.      Spears, who was followed day and night by packs of  photographers for much of 2008, was voted the least desirable  neighbor by 19 percent of adults, followed by Rosie O'Donnell  (18 percent), Joe the Plumber (8 percent), who made headlines  in the final stages of the U.S. presidential elections, and  Lohan (7 percent).      Only two per cent of those asked wanted to live next door  to soccer player Beckham and his singer wife Victoria.      The poll was commissioned by real estate Web site  Zillow.com between Dec 15-17 with 2,196 Americans aged over  18.

      "Text": "     Sept 3 (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John  McCain's newly chosen running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin,  created an immediate stir with news that she is the subject of  a state ethics probe and her unmarried teenage daughter is  pregnant.      Palin will accept the nomination on Wednesday in a speech  to the Republican convention. Here are some potential scenarios  for her candidacy and its impact on the Nov. 4 presidential  election against Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama  and his No. 2, Joe Biden.      - The choice of Palin, 44, a conservative abortion rights  opponent with a record of bucking the Republican establishment  in Alaska, has rallied the conservative base to McCain, who has  struggled to win over that crucial constituency.      Her speech will give the party a chance to answer questions  about her familiarity with domestic and foreign policy issues,  and possibly address the issue of her 17-year-old daughter's  pregnancy and the investigation into whether she abused her  power in having a public safety commissioner fired in Alaska.      'She'll be greeted rapturously because the delegates are  very conservative, as is she,' University of Virginia political  analyst Larry Sabato said of her convention appearance. 'She's  become their heroine. But what the delegates think and what the  country thinks are probably two different things.'      - The selection of the political unknown has raised  questions about McCain's judgment and the degree to which his  campaign investigated Palin's background. That is a distraction  that could hurt the campaign's efforts to generate momentum for  the election battle with Obama.      'My vetting process was completely thorough and I'm  grateful for the results,' McCain told reporters in  Philadelphia.      - Palin's slot on the ticket is secure, but new revelations  or scandals from Alaska could threaten her standing. It would  take a lot, however, to dump her two months before the  election.      'If he drops her, the election is over. There's zero chance  that he'll drop her,' Sabato said.

      "Text": "    By Andrea Hopkins      CINCINNATI, Sept 2 (Reuters) - In America, where teenage  pregnancy is a political issue and working moms subject to  moral debate, the choice of Sarah Palin as the Republican  vice-presidential pick has ignited a Mommy War.      Questions about Palin's qualifications were raised almost  as soon as presidential candidate John McCain shocked the  political world by picking the relatively unknown Alaska  governor to be his running mate last week.      The emergence of personal details has fueled the debate.      News that Palin, a conservative Christian, is running for the  country's No. 2 office while parenting both an infant son with  Down Syndrome and a 17-year-old pregnant daughter has sparked both  condemnation and commendation.      Should a 44-year-old mother of five, including a newborn  with special needs and a pregnant teenager, take on a job that  will keep her away from her home for much of the next two months  to eight years?      Nearly two-thirds of American mothers with preschool-aged  children were in the labor force in 2003, according to the  latest government figures. Women rich and poor, famous or not,  grapple with the same issues and public perceptions.      The Republican Party's conservative base, having worked to  co-opt moral issues for their political cause, so far has  rallied around Palin and her daughter despite its promotion of  abstinence education and traditional families.      The daughter will have the child and marry the father.      'I can't get past the part of the scripture that says it is  the responsibility of the parents to raise the child. But I do  believe that some parents can raise their children well and not  stay home all the time,' said Lindsay Matlock, an anti-abortion  volunteer at this week's Republican convention in Minnesota.      'My only reservation would be that her son has Down  Syndrome and ... her being away so much,' said Matlock, 21.      Dr. Bill Maier, vice president and psychologist in  residence for the conservative Christian group Focus on the  Family, came to the candidate's defense, saying: 'Gov. Palin  seems to have been able to maintain a balance between work and  family.'           SEXISM?      The very fact that Americans are debating whether a woman  with a new baby should be in a demanding job galls Carol Evans,  president and chief executive of Working Mother Media, which  publishes Working Mother magazine.      'The fact that the United States is the only developed  country without paid maternity leave should be front and  center, not whether (Palin) can go back to work with a  four-month old,' said Evans, noting that the average American  working mother returns to work 11 weeks after giving birth.      A question that emerges for Americans of all political  stripes is: Would any of this be asked if Palin was a man?      'If we say a woman can't have a career when her children  are babies, we are discriminating based on gender,' said  Democrat Barbara Matousek, a 41-year-old Wisconsin engineer and  working mother of an 8-month-old.      She was concerned, however, about Palin's other child.      'The thing I have trouble reconciling is how any parent,  male or female, could agree to take on this very public  position at a time when their child is so fragile,' she said.  'Being a pregnant, unmarried, 17-year-old high school student  would be hard enough without the entire world watching.'      Some voters saw authenticity in Palin's life",

      "Text": "    By Dan Whitcomb      LOS ANGELES, Oct 27 (Reuters) - An effigy of U.S.  Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin hanging by a  noose as part of a Halloween display drew complaints on Monday,  but local officials said the homeowner was covered by free  speech rights.      A mannequin dressed to resemble the Alaska governor, with  her trademark beehive hairdo and glasses, was hung by the neck  from the eaves of the home in famously liberal West Hollywood.      On the roof, a mannequin of Republican presidential  candidate John McCain, protruded from the chimney surrounded in  flames, holding his head as he was apparently burned alive.      'We have been getting some phone calls this morning  complaining about it but if (the homeowner) isn't in violation  of municipal code we have no reason to cite them,' West  Hollywood spokeswoman Helen Goss said.      'People have First Amendment rights (to free speech),' Goss  said. 'I would speculate that if it's part of a Halloween  display then its political satire.'      Homeowner Chad Michael Morisette told local KCAL-TV the  display should be considered Halloween 'art' and said his  neighbors would probably be more offended by a similar scene  invoking Democrat Barack Obama.      'I know if we had done Barack Obama, people would have  probably thrown things through our windows,' Morisette said.  'The image of a hanged black man is a lot more intense than the  image of a hanged white woman for our country, the history of  our country.'      Earlier a cardboard likeness of Obama was strung up from a  tree at an Oregon university and an Ohio man who told local  media he didn't want to see an African-American running the  country hung a ghostly figure bearing an Obama sign from a tree  in his yard.      If he wins the Nov. 4 election, Obama will be the first  African American to become U.S. president.      West Hollywood is known for its large gay population and  its liberal politics. It hosts a large and flamboyant outdoor  Halloween parade each year.      Palin, who is seen as more conservative than running-mate  McCain, has been a lightning-rod of criticism from the left  since her nomination to the ticket.

      "Text": " (Adds dropped word in 2nd paragraph)      Sept 2 (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John  McCain's newly chosen running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin,  created an immediate stir with news that she is the subject of  a state ethics probe and her unmarried teenage daughter is  pregnant.      Palin will accept the nomination on Wednesday in a speech  to the Republican convention. Here are some potential scenarios  for her candidacy and its impact on the Nov. 4 presidential  election against Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama  and his No. 2, Joe Biden.      - The choice of Palin, 44, a conservative abortion rights  opponent with a record of bucking the Republican establishment  in Alaska, has rallied the conservative base to McCain, who has  struggled to win over that crucial constituency.      Her speech will give the party a chance to answer questions  about her familiarity with domestic and foreign policy issues,  and possibly address the issue of her 17-year-old daughter's  pregnancy and the investigation into whether she abused her  power in having a public safety commissioner fired in Alaska.      'She'll be greeted rapturously because the delegates are  very conservative, as is she,' University of Virginia political  analyst Larry Sabato said of her convention appearance. 'She's  become their heroine. But what the delegates think and what the  country thinks are probably two different things.'      - The selection of the political unknown has raised  questions about McCain's judgment and the degree to which his  campaign investigated Palin's background. That is a distraction  that could hurt the campaign's efforts to generate momentum for  the election battle with Obama.      'My vetting process was completely thorough and I'm  grateful for the results,' McCain told reporters in  Philadelphia.      - Palin's slot on the ticket is secure, but new revelations  or scandals from Alaska could threaten her standing. It would  take a lot, however, to dump her two months before the  election.      'If he drops her, the election is over. There's zero chance  that he'll drop her,' Sabato said.

      "Text": "    * Palin is surprise choice as running mate      * McCain grabs the political spotlight      * Obama welcomes Palin to race           By Jeff Mason      DAYTON, Ohio, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Republican John McCain  made a surprise choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his  running mate on Friday, adding a political unknown to the  presidential ticket who could help him appeal to women voters.      Palin, 44, a self-described 'hockey mom,' is a conservative  first-term governor of Alaska with strong anti-abortion views,  a record of reform and fiscal conservatism and an outsider's  perspective on Washington.      'She's exactly who I need. She's exactly who this country  needs to help me fight the same old Washington politics of me  first and country second,' McCain told a roaring crowd of  15,000 supporters in Dayton, Ohio.      Palin was chosen over more experienced and better known  contenders as the Arizona senator grabbed the spotlight away  from Democratic rival Barack Obama one day after Obama accepted  his party's presidential nomination before 75,000 flag-waving  supporters at Denver's football stadium.      'Senator, I am honored to be chosen as your running mate. I  will be honored to serve next to the next president of the  United States,' Palin said, joined on stage by her husband and  family. She has five children ranging in age from 5 months to  18 years.      'As governor, I've stood up to the old politics as usual,'  she said. 'This is a moment when principle and political  independence matter.'      McCain and Palin will face Obama and his No. 2, Joe Biden,  in the Nov. 4 presidential election.      The pick followed days of speculation about McCain's  choice, with most of the better-known contenders like former  Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty  eliminated over the last 24 hours.      Palin, former mayor of the town of Wasilla, is virtually  unknown nationally. That could hurt McCain's argument that  Obama, a first-term senator from Illinois, is too inexperienced  to handle the White House.      But she could help him appeal to disaffected supporters of  Democrat Hillary Clinton, who lost a bruising primary to Obama.  Palin noted the achievements of Clinton and Democrat Geraldine  Ferraro, who in 1984 became the first woman vice presidential  nominee of a major party.      'Hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest, hardest  glass ceiling in America,' she said, referring to the 18  million votes Clinton received in the primaries. 'But it turns  out the women of America aren't finished yet, and we can  shatter that glass ceiling once and for all.'           RISKY CHOICE?      The choice of Palin was a risk for McCain given her lack of  national experience, but her record in Alaska will help him  reinforce his reform message. Palin built a reputation as a  reformer in a state that recently has been hit with corruption  scandals.      Elected in 2006, she is Alaska's first woman governor. She  is also an avid sportswoman who would bring youth and vitality  to the ticket. McCain turns 72 on Friday and would be the  oldest person to take office for a first term in the White  House if elected.      'Today, John McCain put the former mayor of a town of 9,000  with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the  presidency,' said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton, who  said she would work to overturn abortion rights and continue  Republican economic policies.

      "Text": "    * Palin is surprise choice as running mate      * McCain grabs the political spotlight      * Obama welcomes Palin to race           By Jeff Mason      DAYTON, Ohio, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Republican John McCain  made a surprise choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his  running mate on Friday, adding a political unknown to the  presidential ticket who could help him appeal to women voters.      Palin, 44, a self-described 'hockey mom,' is a conservative  first-term governor of Alaska with strong anti-abortion views,  a record of reform and fiscal conservatism and an outsider's  perspective on Washington.      'She's exactly who I need. She's exactly who this country  needs to help me fight the same old Washington politics of me  first and country second,' McCain told a roaring crowd of  15,000 supporters in Dayton, Ohio.      Palin was chosen over more experienced and better known  contenders as the Arizona senator grabbed the spotlight away  from Democratic rival Barack Obama one day after Obama accepted  his party's presidential nomination before 75,000 flag-waving  supporters at Denver's football stadium.      'The mission is clear. The next 67 days, I'm going to take  our campaign to every part of our country and our message of  reform to every voter of every background in every political  party or no party at all,' said Palin, joined on stage by her  husband and family. She has five children ranging in age from 5  months to 18 years.      'As governor, I've stood up to the old politics as usual,'  she said. 'This is a moment when principle and political  independence matter a lot more than just party lines.'      McCain and Palin will face Obama and his No. 2, Joe Biden,  in the Nov. 4 presidential election, with polls showing them  running neck-and-neck.      The pick followed days of speculation about McCain's  choice, with most of the better-known contenders like former  Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty  eliminated over the last 24 hours.           '18 MILLION CRACKS'      Palin, the former mayor of the town of Wasilla, is  virtually unknown and untested nationally. That could hurt  McCain's argument that Obama, 47, a first-term senator from  Illinois, is too inexperienced to handle the White House.      But she could help him appeal to disaffected supporters of  Democrat Hillary Clinton, who lost a bruising primary to Obama.  Palin noted the achievements of Clinton and Democrat Geraldine  Ferraro, who in 1984 became the first woman vice presidential  nominee of a major party.      'Hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest, hardest  glass ceiling in America,' she said, referring to the 18  million votes Clinton received in the primaries. 'But it turns  out the women of America aren't finished yet, and we can  shatter that glass ceiling once and for all.'      Palin would be the first woman U.S. vice president, adding  another historic element to a presidential race that has been  filled with firsts. Obama, 47, is the first black nominee of a  major U.S. political party.      Her record in Alaska will help McCain reinforce his reform  message. Palin built a reputation as a reformer in a state that  recently has been hit with corruption scandals.      Elected in 2006, she is Alaska's first woman governor. She  is also an avid sportswoman who would bring youth and vitality  to the ticket. McCain turns 72 on Friday and would be the  oldest person to take office for a first term in the White  House ",

      "Text": "    June 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Thursday,  for the first time in the country's history, that individual  Americans have the right to own guns for personal use, and struck  down a strict gun control law in the U.S. capital, Washington.           Following are some facts about the case.           * It marks the first time in nearly 70 years that the Supreme  Court has taken up the meaning of the Second Amendment, the  portion of the U.S. Constitution that addresses an individual's  right to bear arms.      * The Supreme Court's previous review of the Second  Amendment came in a five-page discussion in an opinion issued  in 1939 that failed to definitively resolve the constitutional  issue.      * At issue was the city's strict gun-control law -- a ban on  private possession of handguns and requirement that any rifles or  shotguns kept at home be unloaded and disassembled or bound by a  trigger lock.      * The court's ruling could have a far-reaching impact on  gun-control laws in the United States, which is estimated to have  the world's highest civilian gun ownership rate. The ruling could  become an issue in the November presidential election.      * During oral arguments in March, Justice Stephen Breyer  cited statistics that between 80,000 and 100,000 people in the  United States every year are killed or wounded in gun-related  homicides or crimes, accidents or suicides. He said that in  Washington, D.C., the number totals around 200 to 300 dead and  between 1,500 to 2,000 people wounded.      * The arguments followed a string of mass shootings in the  previous year -- multiple killings on at least three college  campuses, two shopping centers and one Missouri town meeting.      * The case divided the Bush administration. Then-Solicitor  General Paul Clement, the administration's lawyer before the  Supreme Court, said individuals have a right to own a gun, but  it is subject to reasonable government regulation. Vice  President Dick Cheney joined a group of U.S. House of  Representatives and Senate members in urging a stronger stand  in favor of gun rights.

      "Text": "The Justice Department has interpreted the Second Amendment as granting an individual right to bear arms. It\u2019s about time.\n\nFor years, Justice Department policy has been to interpret the Second Amendment as granting a collective right to bear arms, an interpretation supposedly in line with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Miller.\n\nHowever, Attorney General John Ashcroft and Solicitor General Theodore Olsen recently reversed policy and found that the Second Amendment promotes an individual right to bear arms. This decision is a proper return to originalist constitutional principles with beneficial public policy effects.\n\nThe decision received a great deal of criticism from observers who argued that the Justice Department was not justified in reversing policy that stemmed from the Supreme Court\u2019s Miller decision, which is viewed by many to reject an individual right to bear arms, favoring only a collective right.\n\nHowever, this view is likely mistaken. In Miller, the Supreme Court merely states that \"[I]n the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument.\"\n\nThe Court\u2019s discussion clearly centered on whether a particular shotgun with specific dimensions (a sawed-off shotgun) had a relationship to the preservation of a well-regulated militia, with the answer being no. This is an exceedingly narrow ruling, and did not constitute a declaration by the Court that the Second Amendment did not convey upon the citizenry an individual right to bear arms.\n\nCritics of the Justice Department's new policy are misrepresenting Miller. Miller merely addressed whether the Second Amendment guaranteed the possession of a specific shotgun. It did not address whether the Second Amendment grants an individual or a collective right to bear arms.\n\nA search for more conclusive language regarding the Second Amendment\u2019s extension of an individual right to bear arms requires only a look at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 recent decision in United States v. Emerson. Agreeing that Miller did not resolve the issue of whether the Second Amendment grants an individual or a collective right, the Emerson court took up the matter itself. It found that the Second Amendment \"protects the rights of individuals, including those not then actually a member of any militia or engaged in active military service or training, to privately possess and bear their own firearms.\"\n\nWhile the Emerson court hastened to add that the right is not absolute, the fact is that no right guaranteed anywhere in the Constitution is absolute.\n\nMoreover, as Professor Glenn Reynolds points out, the individual rights theory of the Second Amendment does nothing to strike down reasonable gun control laws \u2014 such as preventing people with violent histories from owning guns, or forbidding reasonable waiting periods.\n\nReynolds also argues that a firm recognition of an individual rights interpretation of the Second Amendment will enable the public to have less heated, and more dispassionate, debates about gun control. Second Amendment advocates will no longer have to fear that gun control is a Trojan horse designed to eventually erode the fundamental right to bear arms.\n\nOther critics of the Justice Department\u2019s reversal argue that the specific language of the Second Amendment militates against an individual right to bear arms. The Second Amendment reads as follows: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n\nOpponents of individual rights focus on the prefatory language, \"a well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State,\" and argue that the Second Amendment was only meant to arm militias. The Framers, this argument goes, limited the scope of the Second Amendment by use of the prefatory language, which they did not do elsewhere in the Bill of Rights.\n\nHowever, Second Amendment scholar Professor Eugene Volokh has pointed out that this argument has little merit. Prefatory language is much more common in the construction of constitutional text than individual rights critics like to claim.\n\nFor example, the state constitutions for both Rhode Island and New Hampshire use prefatory language in reference to free press and criminal trials, respectively. Rhode Island\u2019s constitution reads, \"[t]he liberty of the press being essential to the security of freedom in a state, any person may publish his sentiments on any subject, being responsible for an abuse of that liberty.\"\n\nWould the same Second Amendment critics want their prefatory language argument used to restrict speech or impair the right to a fair trial?\n\nIn addition to the legal arguments, the policy reasons behind the Justice Department\u2019s new decision are compelling. Yale statistician John Lott persuasively shows in his book More Guns, Less Crime that \"right-to-carry\" laws lead to a dramatic reduction in crimes against the person, due to the deterrent effect of those laws.\n\nThe logic is simple: A criminal will be less likely to attack a person if the potential victim may be armed. Recognizing that the Second Amendment grants an individual right to bear arms directly supports the implementation and the legality of right-to-carry legislation. Thus, the Justice Department\u2019s position is not only consistent with the original intent of the Second Amendment, it makes eminent policy sense in the effort to keep people safe from the threat of violent crime.\n\nDespite the controversy, the Justice Department\u2019s decision to recognize an individual right to bear arms under the Second Amendment was appropriate and justified. The Justice Department properly interpreted legal precedent and the traditions of constitutional construction.\n\nMoreover, the department\u2019s decision will have a tangible policy benefit in deterring violent crime against individuals. The collective rights interpretation of the Second Amendment should have been changed long ago. Now that the change is finally being made, it should be welcomed, not condemned.\n\nPejman Yousefzadeh is an attorney living in southern California.

DEMOCRATS      SEN. HILLARY CLINTON      She has said law-abiding citizens should be able to own  guns but laws are needed to keep guns out of the hands of  criminals.

      "Text": "    SAN FRANCISCO, June 27 (Reuters) - A day after the U.S.  Supreme Court struck down a ban on handguns in Washington,  D.C., the National Rifle Association gun rights group filed  lawsuits on Friday in San Francisco and Chicago against gun  bans there.      'The Supreme Court held yesterday that the Second Amendment  right is exercised individually and belongs to all Americans,'  Chris Cox, the NRA's chief lobbyist, said in a statement.  'These lawsuits will ensure that state and local governments  hear those words.'      The San Francisco lawsuit challenges a local ordinance and  lease provisions barring possession of handguns by public  housing residents.      The Chicago case challenges a handgun ban similar to the  Washington, D.C., law struck down by the Supreme Court. The NRA  also filed lawsuits challenging gun restrictions in the Chicago  suburbs of Evanston, Morton Grove and Oak Park.      'In Washington, D.C., or in any state, whether you live in  the housing projects or a high end suburb, you have the right  to defend yourself and your family at home,' Cox said. 'These  laws all deny that right.'      In its 5-4 decision, the court held that individual  Americans have a right to own guns, a finding that struck down  a strict gun control law in the nation's capital.      The landmark ruling marked the first time in nearly 70  years the high court addressed the Second Amendment of the U.S.  Constitution, and rejected the argument that the amendment's  right to keep and bear arms is tied to service in a state  militia.      San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom said he had expected the  decision to open the door for a challenge to his city's gun  laws.      'I intend to fight any NRA lawsuit that challenges our  common-sense gun laws every step of the way,' he said in a  statement.      San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera echoed Newsom.      'On the basis of the law as it exists today, I am confident  that our local gun control measures are on sound legal footing  and will survive legal challenges,' Herrera said in a  statement.

      "Text": "    By James Vicini      WASHINGTON, March 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court  considers on Tuesday a landmark legal battle over gun rights,  taking up for the first time in nearly 70 years whether  Americans have the right to keep and bear arms.      The court's ruling, expected by the end of June, could have  a far-reaching impact on gun control laws in the United States,  estimated to have the world's highest civilian gun ownership  rate, and could become an issue in the November election.      At issue is whether to strike down or uphold one of the  nation's strictest gun control laws -- a Washington, D.C., ban  on private possession of handguns and a requirement that any  rifles or shotguns kept at home be unloaded and dissembled or  bound by a trigger lock.      The case is widely viewed as one of the most important of  the Supreme Court's current term, along with cases on the  rights of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners and the U.S. lethal  injection method of execution.      The case could resolve the much-disputed meaning of the  Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and whether it  protects an individual's right to possess guns or a collective  right of the people for service in a state militia.      The Supreme Court's last review of the Second Amendment  came in a five-page discussion in an opinion issued in 1939  that failed to definitively resolve the constitutional issue.      The arguments follow a series of mass shootings in the past  year -- multiple killings on at least three college campuses,  two shopping centers and one Missouri town meeting. Gun deaths  average 80 a day in the United States, 34 of them homicides,  according to Centers for Disease Control data.      The case has split the Bush administration.      Solicitor General Paul Clement, the administration's chief  advocate before the Supreme Court, has adopted the position  that individuals have a right to own a gun, but it is subject  to reasonable government regulation.      Clement, who is arguing before the justices, seeks to  preserve all of the current federal restrictions, including a  ban on new machine gun sales, a ban on felons owning guns and  required background checks for new buyers of handguns.      But Vice President Dick Cheney joined a group of U.S. House  of Representatives and Senate members in urging the court to  adopt a stronger stand in favor of gun rights.      Walter Dellinger, the attorney defending the Washington  law, argued the Second Amendment protected only militia-related  firearms rights.      But even if an individual has the right to possess guns,  the law should be upheld as a reasonable restriction, he said.      The third attorney scheduled to appear at the arguments,   Alan Gura, said the law should be struck down. He represents  Dick Anthony Heller, who lives in a high-crime neighborhood and  wants to keep a handgun for self-defense.

      "Text": "This is a rush transcript from \"America's Election HQ,\" October 30, 2008. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nBILL HEMMER, HOST: What does the election mean for gun owners in America? One group is not pulling for Barack Obama. The NRA, National Rifle Association, spent millions on ads against him. Some people are reportedly buying up guns in the event of an Obama presidency coming out of Tuesday's vote.\n\nChris Cox, chief lobbyist for the NRA. Chris, good evening to you.\n\nCHRIS COX, CHIEF LOBBYIST, NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION: Thanks for having me, Bill.\n\nHEMMER: What are these owners so worried about, you think?\n\n\u2022 Video: Watch Bill Hemmer's interview\n\nCOX: Well, they're worried about Barack Obama winning and they're worried if he wins, he will take their guns away. And the truth is, they have a reason to worry.\n\nHEMMER: Why?\n\nCOX: This guy \u2014 he supported the most radical gun control agenda that's ever been imagined. He voted to ban single shot and double-barrel shotguns. He's voted to ban almost all hunting ammunition. He supported a 500 percent tax increase on guns and ammunition. So this guy is bad news when it comes to the Second Amendment and if people are buying guns, it doesn't really surprise me.\n\nHEMMER: You're laying it on. He is saying that this piece of paper when he was in the Illinois legislature wasn't his handwriting. You are not buying that, are you?\n\nCOX: No, because the second questionnaire had his handwriting on it. You don't even have to go back that far. This year he said he supported Washington D.C.'s handgun ban and Washington's D.C.'s ban on self-defense in the home. And that's something that has gun owners really worried. This is a \u2014\n\nHEMMER: I was on his Web site today and I was looking around for this issue. It's a bit hard to find. It's under additional issues under the category of sportsmen.\n\nBut this is what the campaign is telling us, \"Barack Obama,\" they say, \"believes the Second Amendment creates an individual right and he respects the constitutional right of Americans to bear arms. He will protect the rights of hunters and other law-abiding Americans who purchase, transport and use guns.\" That's a statement. Chris?\n\nCOX: Well, Bill, four years ago, we saw John Kerry do signing and nobody really believed he was somehow a supporter of hunting heritage. And Barack Obama's rhetoric is very different from his record. And what we're going to do is expose the guy who opposes self-defense with a firearm, opposes hunting, opposes legitimate firearms for personal protection.\n\nAnd it's important that Americans know that he is spending millions of dollars because he has zero credibility when it comes to the Second Amendment.\n\nHEMMER: Do you have an issue with John McCain? I went to his Web site, too. It's a little more prominent. It's under the category of Second Amendment. He wants an instant background check for all dealers, whether you're private or whether you're licensed. Do you have an issue with that?\n\nCOX: We have had disagreements with Sen. McCain. But if you compare Sen. McCain and Sen. Obama, there is a clear choice on the Second Amendment. McCain has voted against gun bans. He votes for self-defense and Barack Obama has been on the wrong side of every issue.\n\nHEMMER: All right. We've got to leave it there. We're out of time. Chris COX from the NRA, thank you for your time. To be continued.\n\nCOX: Thanks for having me.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2008 FOX News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The landmark 5-4 ruling marked the first time in nearly 70  years the country's high court has addressed whether the Second  Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects an individual right  to keep and bear arms, rather than a right tied to service in a  state militia.      In the majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia said the  Second Amendment protected an individual right to possess a  firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that  arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense  within the home.      Although an individual now has a constitutional right to  own guns, that new right is not unlimited, wrote Scalia, a  hunter.      He said the ruling should not be taken to cast doubt on  long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by  felons and the mentally ill or on laws forbidding the carrying  of firearms in places like schools and government buildings or  laws imposing conditions on gun sales.      The Supreme Court's last review of the Second Amendment  came in a five-page discussion in an opinion issued in 1939  that failed to definitively resolve the constitutional issue.      In Thursday's opinion, the court struck down the country's  strictest gun control law adopted in Washington, D.C., 32 years  ago. It bans private possession of handguns and requires that  any rifles or shotguns kept at home be unloaded and dissembled  or bound by a trigger lock.           FIRST TIME GUN CONTROL LAW STRUCK DOWN      The ruling marked the first time that the Supreme Court has  struck down a gun control law for violating the Second  Amendment. The ruling could be the beginning of an era in which  anti-gun regulations are subject to legal challenges.      The justices split along conservative-liberal lines in the  ruling, one of the most important of the court's current term,  in deciding a legal battle over gun rights in America. The  ruling came on the last day of the court's 2007-08 term.      In dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote, 'The decision  threatens to throw into doubt the constitutionality of gun laws  throughout the United States.'      President George W. Bush's two appointees on the court,  Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, both voted  with the majority in finding an individual right to keep  firearms.      The court adopted the gun rights position advocated by the  Bush administration. White House spokesman Tony Fratto said,      'We're pleased that the Supreme Court affirmed that the  Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to keep and  bear arms.'      Republican presidential candidate John McCain applauded the  ruling and criticized his likely Democratic opponent Barack  Obama for comments he had made.      'Unlike the elitist view that believes Americans cling to  guns out of bitterness, today's ruling recognizes that gun  ownership is a fundamental right -- sacred, just as the right  to free speech and assembly,' McCain said.      The ruling came the day after a worker at a plastics plant  in Henderson, Kentucky, used a handgun to shoot and kil",

The ruling marked the first time the court has struck down  a gun control law for violating the Second Amendment.      The ruling won praise from the White House, Republican  presidential candidate John McCain and Wayne LaPierre of the  politically powerful National Rifle Association, who said,  'This is a great moment in American history.'      It drew fire from gun control groups, which warned of new  legal attacks on existing gun laws, and some Democrats in  Congress like Sen.

'What is not debatable is that it is not the role of this  court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct,' he said.      'Few laws in the history of our nation have come close to  the severe restriction of the district's handgun ban,' Scalia  said.           GUN POINTED AT BURGLAR WHILE CALLING POLICE      Scalia said a citizen may prefer may prefer a handgun for  home defense because 'it can be pointed at a burglar with one  hand while the other hand dials the police.'      The justices split along conservative-liberal lines in the  ruling, one of the most important of the court's current term,  in deciding a legal battle over gun rights in America.

      "Text": "    By Ed Stoddard      FORT WORTH, Texas, June 26 (Reuters) - Gun-loving Americans  applauded their Supreme Court on Thursday after it ruled for  the first time in U.S. history that they had a right to own  firearms.      'I think it's great because Americans should have the  freedom to own guns and rifles, because America is a so-called  free country and that is one of our freedoms,' said 16-year-old  high school student and avid raccoon hunter Stella Richardson.      She and her mother were buying a new pistol holster for her  father at a Cabela's shop in Fort Worth, part of a chain  catering to U.S. hunters and gun enthusiasts.      The reaction to the decision was universally favorable  among those browsing in the firearms section of the store,  where hundreds of handguns gleam in glass display cases in  front of long rows of rifles and shotguns.      Individual Americans have a right to own guns, the Supreme  Court ruled for the first time in the country's history,  striking down a strict gun control law in Washington D.C.      The landmark 5-4 ruling marked the first time in nearly 70  years that the high court had addressed the Second Amendment of  the U.S. Constitution.      'I think the decision should have been nine to zero,' said  Don Polk, 60, as he browsed for a handgun.      'I think people up there in Washington should be able to  protect themselves the way that the rest of us have been  allowed to,' he said.      Buying a firearm is not a big problem in Texas where it is  even possible and fairly easy to obtain a permit to carry a  concealed handgun. A 'castle law' enables homeowners here to  shoot intruders if they feel threatened.      Bob Schultz, a Vietnam veteran and gun owner in a Dallas  suburb, spoke to Reuters in his home as he opened his .38  special to show that it was loaded -- as always.      'I wholeheartedly agree with this Supreme Court decision.  But I don't think it will deter the anti-gun lobby, they will  continue to crusade against weapons,' he said.      Besides two handguns, his main 'home defense' system is a  12-gauge pistol grip shotgun with a short barrel. At close  range that will put a big hole in an unwanted intruder.      At Cabela's, 71-year-old Bonnie Deberry browsed with her  husband for new handguns to add to their collection.      'I think you ought to be able to have one and carry them  openly. This country was built on guns,' she said.   (Editing by Anthony Boadle)   ((edward.stoddard@reuters.com; +1 817 421 4743))  Keywords: USA GUNS/COURT GUNSHOP        ",

      "Text": " (Bernd Debusmann is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed  are his own)       By Bernd Debusmann      WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Is America, land of shooting  massacres in schools and public places, slowly falling out of  love with guns?       The answer is yes, and it runs counter to popular  perceptions of the United States as a country where most  citizens are armed to the teeth and believe it is every  American's inalienable right to buy an AK 47-style assault rifle  with the minimum of bureaucratic paperwork.      But in fact, gun ownership in the United States has been  declining steadily over more than three decades, relegating gun  owners to minority status.       At the same time, support for stricter gun controls has been  growing steadily and those in favour make up a majority.      This is a little-reported phenomenon but the trend is shown  clearly by statistics compiled by the University of Chicago's  National Opinion Research Center (NORC), which has been tracking  gun ownership and attitudes on firearms since 1972, the  longest-running survey on the subject in the United States.       The number of households with guns dropped from a high of 54  percent in 1977 to 34.5 percent in 2006, according to NORC, and  the percentage of Americans who reported personally owning a gun  has shrunk to just under 22 percent.        So, by the rules of democratic play, one might assume that  the majority would have major influence on legislation. But  that's not how it works, thanks to the enormous influence of the  gun lobby.       The long-term decline monitored by the Chicago survey has  buoyed proponents of tighter gun controls. 'America's gun  culture is fading,' says Josh Sugarmann, who heads the  Washington-based Violence Policy Center.       According to Sugarmann, those keeping the culture alive and  those most vocal in resisting tighter regulations are white,  middle-aged men whose enthusiasm for firearms, hunting and  shooting is not shared by younger Americans.      Yet, at the moment it's difficult to imagine the U.S.  without its gun culture.       But then, who could have imagined France with a ban on  smoking in public places, Germany with speed limits on almost  half its autobahns, or a black man as a serious contender in  this year's presidential elections in the United States?      To what extent gun ownership will continue to shrink  depends, at least in part, on a decision by the U.S. Supreme  court expected this summer. The court will rule on one of the  most acrimonious disputes in the United States: do Americans  have the constitutional right to own and bear arms?            GUN RAMPAGES PART OF LIFE      At the heart of the long-running debate, argued with more  passion than almost any other, is the meaning of the U.S.  constitution's second amendment.       Written 219 years ago, it says: 'A well regulated Militia,  being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of  the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'      A string of lower court rulings over several decades held  that the amendment meant to guarantee the collective right of  state militias, not individual citizens. Such rulings have had  limited impact: gun regulations vary from state to state and in  most, weapons are easy to buy and legal to keep.      There are a few exceptions: handguns are illegal in Chicago  and in Washington, where a court ruled in December that its  total ban violated the constitution. That ",

      "Text": "    By Steve Holland      CINCINNATI, June 26 (Reuters) - Republican presidential  candidate John McCain accused Democratic rival Barack Obama on  Thursday of reversing his position on a gun ban in the nation's  capital and said it was part of a pattern of flip-flopping by  the Illinois senator.      An Obama supporter responded by saying it was insincere for  McCain to make that charge because he himself had flip-flopped  'more times than a pancake.'      The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 on Thursday for the first time  that individual Americans have a right to own guns, striking  down a strict gun control law in Washington.      Obama in February had voiced support for the gun ban in  Washington. But after the Supreme Court voted to lift the ban,  Obama said he agreed with the court's decision that Americans  have a right to bear arms.      'I have said consistently that I believe the Second  Amendment is an individual right,' Obama told Fox Business  News, referring to the constitutional amendment that grants  Americans the right to bear arms.      'And that was the essential decision that the Supreme Court  came down on. And it also recognized that even though we have  an individual right to bear arms, that right can be limited by  sensible, reasonable gun laws,' he said.      McCain, speaking to reporters on his Straight Talk Express  bus in Cincinnati, saw a flip-flop on the part of his opponent  in the November election.       'All I can say is, it's one in a long series of reversals  of positions,' McCain said.      The Arizona senator also has faced charges of position  switches, most recently his decision last week to support  lifting a ban on U.S. offshore oil drilling.        'THE KING OF FLIP-FLOPS'      Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, an Obama supporter, disputed  McCain on MSNBC, saying Obama had always been for individual  gun rights.      'For Sen. McCain, the king of the flip-flops, who has  flip-flopped more times than a pancake, it's really  disingenuous for him to be making accusations like that,' the  Florida lawmaker said.      McCain and his campaign surrogates cited Obama's decision  last week to decline public financing for his campaign after  saying he would take it, as well as his recent statement saying  he was willing to explore nuclear power as an option for  America's energy crisis after long opposing it.      McCain, in his Republican primary battle against former  Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, had repeatedly characterized  Romney as a flip-flopper.      The strategy aims to paint the opponent as someone who  adjusts positions when it is politically convenient.      McCain is running behind Obama in national surveys of  voters and in polls taken in a number of battleground states,  including Ohio, which has been a key factor in the last two  presidential elections.      Many presidential candidates move to a more centrist  position after winning battles for their party's nomination  that often pull them to the left or right.      A McCain supporter, Kansas Republican Sen. Sam Brownback,  said he believed Obama was moving to the center.      'It does seem to reflect a willingness that as the campaign  changes from a primary to a general, willingness to change on  positions, to be more liberal in the primary, to moving more  conservative in the general election,' Brownback said.

      "Text": "Despite the high emotions that surround war \u2014 or perhaps because of them \u2014 people are focusing again on \"normal\" life. But what is normal has shifted in ways both obvious and subtle. Consider how war has affected just one issue: the debate over gun control.\n\nFor years, gun ownership advocates have agonized over how to make women comfortable around guns. As of 2000, 41.7 percent of men and 28.5 percent of women reported having a gun in their household, and 39.2 percent of men but only 10 percent of women personally owned a gun.\n\nReaching out to women and minorities has been a high priority of organizations like the National Rifle Association, not merely to swell their ranks but also to convert segments of society that have traditionally opposed the right to own a gun.\n\nNow, the outreach has become easier. As of 2002, over 210,000 women were on active duty within the military, over 150,000 were in the reserves. A steep increase in the number of women in the military means that an unprecedented number of Gen-Next women have overcome their mothers' aversion to guns.\n\nNon-military women also picked up guns. NRA spokeswoman Nance Pretto reported that, in the wake of Sept. 11, women's enrollment in instructional shooting classes increased fourfold from years before. And gun dealers reported a sharp increase in women purchasing weapons.\n\nThe sense of insecurity caused by Sept. 11 was heightened as police officers in the reserves left for active duty, depleting police departments. Some politicians began to actively encourage women to protect themselves by owning guns. When a serial killer was loose in Baton Rouge in the summer of 2002, Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster advised women \"you have a right to get a [concealed] gun permit. ... if you know how [to use a gun] and you have a situation with some fruitcake running around, like they've got right now, it sure can save you a lot of grief.\"\n\nFoster received the predictable backlash of outrage from gun control advocates who suddenly sounded sexist. Holley Galland Haymaker from the anti-gun group Louisiana Ceasefire argued: \"Maybe if you're a big, white guy who hunts all the time, it might do some good. For a woman who is surprise attacked, having a gun is only giving them [the attacker] another way to kill you.\"\n\nI will ignore the racist implications of this remark and simply ask, \"Why would a white guy who hunts be more competent with a gun than a woman who is trained to use it?\"\n\nTo judge from how strained their arguments have become, gun control advocates realize they are losing the debate. It would be difficult to escape this realization. Last Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1036 \u2014 the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \u2014 which grants gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits resulting from their products. The vote (04/09) was 285 to 140. The measure has now moved to the Senate where it is expected to pass.\n\nAs Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., argued, \"Manufacturers of legal products should not live under the threat of litigation simply because their product is misused ... [W]e don't sue Ginsu when someone is stabbed to death with their knife.\"\n\nAgain, the anti-gun arguments were shrill. A paper published by the Brady Center, entitled \"Smoking Guns: Exposing the Gun Industry's Complicity in the Illegal Gun Market,\" openly accused the firearms industry of \"actively and knowingly allowing guns to be sold into the illegal market.\" In short, gun manufacturers were publicly charged with criminal complicity.\n\nOther gun control advocates are pushing to have guns declared as \"weapons of mass destruction (WMD).\" For example, House Bill 1210 in Washington State defined a WMD as a \"device, object, or substance that a person intends to use to cause multiple human deaths.\" No specific weapons were mentioned but the Seattle Times opened its March 15 coverage of the bill with the sentence, \"An anti-terrorism bill has spurred debate among lawmakers: Is a gun a weapon of mass destruction?\" Possession would have been a class A felony had the bill passed with above-referenced language. Many in the pro-gun rights camp view the WMD argument as an indication of attacks to come.\n\nThe underlying facts of the gun debate remain much the same as before Sept. 11 and the war. The award-winning criminologist Prof. Gary Kleck states that firearms are used defensively 2.5 million times a year. 48 percent of those incidents involve women defending themselves; most of the time a shot is not fired. The conclusion: women benefit from gun ownership.\n\nWhat is changing, however, are the faces and attitudes of the debate. A growing number of women feel comfortable with guns and want them for self-defense. In response, anti-gun advocates are using arguments that seem increasingly implausible such as classifying guns as WMDs.\n\nGun ownership is just one of the issues over which we will stumble on the way back to normal life. And, as people drink coffee and read newspapers in the morning, they will discover that the war has influenced every aspect of public debate, including the words we use to describe and redefine our beliefs.\n\nWendy McElroy is the editor of ifeminists.com and a research fellow for The Independent Institute in Oakland, Calif.

      "Text": " (This is the first in a series of stories on guns in America  ahead of Supreme Court arguments on March 18)      By James Vicini      WASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - For the first time in 70  years, the U.S. Supreme Court will take on the question of  whether individual Americans have the right to keep and bear  arms or whether it a collective right of the people for service  in a state militia.      That question is at the heart of a long, impassioned debate  about how much power the government has to keep people from  owning guns and it could soon be decided by the U.S. Supreme  Court in a case about one of the nation's strictest gun control  laws.      Set for arguments on March 18 and with a decision expected  by late June, the nation's highest court could resolve once and  for all the much-disputed meaning of the Second Amendment of  the U.S. Constitution.      Written 219 years ago, the amendment says, 'A well  regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free  state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not  be infringed.'      Few constitutional law issues have triggered more scholarly  debate and historical research on whether the Constitution's  authors intended to guarantee an individual right or a  collective right tied to service in a state-regulated militia,  like today's National Guard.      The arguments follow a series of mass shootings in the past  year -- multiple killings on at least three college campuses,  two shopping centers and one Missouri town meeting. Gun deaths  average 80 a day in the United States, 34 of them homicides,  according to Centers for Disease Control data, and yet the gun  issue has barely registered in the U.S. presidential campaign.      If the court finds it is an individual right, gun control  advocates fear it could place in jeopardy not only the ban on  private handgun ownership in the U.S. capital at issue in the  case, but also other laws around the country regulating and  restricting private possession of firearms.      The Supreme Court's last review of the Second Amendment  came in a five-page discussion in an opinion issued nearly 70  years ago that failed to definitively resolve the  constitutional issue.      That could change when the justices consider whether a  32-year-old Washington, D.C., law banning private possession of  handguns violates the Second Amendment rights of individuals  unaffiliated with any state-regulated militia.           DIVISIVE ISSUE      Former top U.S. Justice Department officials including  former Attorney General Janet Reno, law professors, linguistic  experts and historians all argued the Second Amendment protects  the right of people only to keep arms for militia service.      On the other side, the Bush administration, the powerful  National Rifle Association, a majority of the U.S. Senate and a  majority of the House of Representatives argued an individual  has the right to possess arms.      The administration, under then-Attorney General John  Ashcroft, reversed the position the federal government had  taken for decades and said in 2001 the Second Amendment  protected an individual right to possess firearms for a lawful  private purpose.      Solicitor General Paul Clement, the administration's chief  advocate before the Supreme Court, filed a brief with the  justices that adopted many arguments made previously by legal  scholars for an individual right to keep arms.      He said placement of the Second Amendment with",

      "Text": "    By Kitty Bu      YUQUAN, China, Jan 12 (Reuters) - In a frigid forest in  northeastern China, sub-zero temperatures and thick snow aren't  enough to dampen tourists' enthusiasm for firing a few rounds at  farm-raised animals let loose in the wild.      Yuquan International Hunting Field in Heilongjiang province  draws more than 100,000 domestic tourists a year, many travelling  thousands of miles to get their hands on a rifle or shotgun for  the first time in a country where gun ownership is strictly  controlled.      This is despite temperatures often straining to reach as warm  as minus 20 degrees Celsius in the daytime, and snow heavy on the  ground for six months of the year.      'Our country has very tight controls on gun ownership,' said  Wang Zengyu, Yuquan's manager.      The controls keep the tourists coming in, but also limit the  business's prospects, the former hotel manager said.      'If we need to buy arms, have our guns fixed or renewed, we  need to go to places that are designated by security authorities.  It would be illegal for us to go through other channels.'      Yuquan -- a 3,000-acre (1,200-hectare) reserve about 50 km  (30 miles) from Harbin, Heilongjiang's provincial capital -- is  hardly a sprawling wilderness, but it is the largest of China's  few designated hunting parks.      Once common across China's vast countryside, private gun  ownership has been effectively banned since the Communist Party  swept to power in 1949, stripping farmers and hunters of weapons.      Three decades of economic reforms, however, have seen private  ownership gain pace, from cashed-up enthusiasts willing to  negotiate the red tape to legally obtain a firearm, to black  market guns fashioned crudely for sale by impoverished villagers.      The quarry at Yuquan is limited to farm-raised rabbits,  pheasants and pigeons, while the generally male-dominated  shooting parties share a maximum two guns an outing.      The restrictions grate on some of Yuquan's visitors.      'I think they need to improve their service,' sniffed Chen  Shaowei, who was once a crack shooter with the People's  Liberation Army.      'We need more guides and guns. At the very least, two people  should share one gun ... There are more than 20 of us today, but  all of us are sharing two guns,' Chen said.      With permits to keep only 20 guns on site -- a mixture of  double-barrelled shotguns and low-calibre rifles -- Wang, the  owner, agrees.      'I hope we can have access to more types of guns ... If we  can use other kinds, customers can shoot more types of animals.  It would be more fun for them,' Wang said.      A fledgling but growing animal rights movement in China may  also crimp Wang's business fortunes and curtail would-be hunters'  enthusiasm.      In 2006, forestry officials shelved a plan to auction off  licences to hunt game in China's hinterlands after an outcry from  local media and Internet users.      A hunting reserve in China's northern Shanxi province  advertised prominently in Beijing's subway tunnels in recent  months has also drawn fire in local papers.      China's lamentable animal rights record, including  over-crowded zoos and bears farmed for bile for use in  traditional Chinese medicine, has long been condemned by wildlife  groups.      Officially, China remains ambivalent about pushing forward  animal protection, and has flagged lifting a 1993 ban on the  trade of tiger bones and parts under pressure from local  businesses.  ",

      "Text": " (adds details)      WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - The Supreme Court ruled on  Thursday, for the first time in U.S. history, that individual  Americans have the right to own guns for personal use, and  struck down a strict gun control law in the nation's capital.      The landmark 5-4 ruling marked the first time in nearly 70  years the high court has addressed whether the Second Amendment  of the U.S. Constitution protects an individual right to keep  and bear arms, rather than a right tied to service in a state  militia.      Writing the court's majority opinion, Justice Antonin  Scalia said the Second Amendment protected an individual right  to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and  to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as  self-defense within the home.      Although an individual now has a constitutional right to  own guns, that new right is not unlimited, wrote Scalia, a  hunter.      The ruling came the day after a worker at a plastics plant  in Henderson, Kentucky, used a handgun to shoot and kill five  people inside the factory before killing himself, the latest in  a series of deadly shooting sprees across the country.      The Supreme Court's last review of the Second Amendment  came in a five-page discussion in an opinion issued in 1939  that failed to definitively resolve the constitutional issue.      The court struck down the nation's strictest gun control  law adopted in Washington D.C., 32 years ago. It bans private  possession of handguns and requires that any rifles or shotguns  kept at home be unloaded and dissembled or bound by a trigger  lock.      The justices split along conservative-liberal lines in the  ruling, one of the most important of the court's current term,  in deciding a legal battle over gun rights in America. The  ruling came on the last day of the court's 2007-08 term.      President George W. Bush's two appointees on the court,  Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, both voted  with the majority in finding an individual right to keep  firearms.      In dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote, 'The decision  threatens to throw into doubt the constitutionality of gun laws  throughout the United States.'

      "Text": " (Updates with summit plan, previous WASHINGTON)      By Tabassum Zakaria      CAMP DAVID, Md., Oct 18 (Reuters) - President George W.  Bush will announce on Saturday that the United States will host  a summit of world leaders on the global financial crisis, a  senior U.S. administration official said.      'President Bush will announce that he will host a summit of  world leaders in the near future to discuss the global response  to the financial crisis, ideas to prevent such a crisis from  recurring in the future in a way that preserves our free market  system,' the official said on condition of anonymity.      'The president wants participation and ideas from both  developed and developing nations in these discussions,' the  official said.      Bush will meet French President Nicolas Sarkozy and  European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso later  Saturday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland,  about the financial crisis that sent tremors through world  economies.      A credit crisis that swept around the globe has pummeled   markets, leaving the United States and its European allies  searching for ways to cushion the shock to financial systems.      Sarkozy has called for an overhaul of the current  international financial architecture established just after  World War II at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference.      Bush has not made any public comments about that proposal  and White House aides say the focus at the Camp David meeting  will be addressing the immediate crisis.      'Many leaders and economies have ideas to improve the  global financial system,' White House spokesman Tony Fratto  said. 'We should be listening to all good ideas. I'm certain  leaders in Europe aren't recommending that we simply impose a  structure on the rest of the world without the input from other  economies,' he said.      Sarkozy, whose country holds the rotating European Union  presidency, said he would like to see a Group of Eight leading  nations summit next month in New York. The White House said a  date and venue for the global leaders meeting, expected by year  end, would not be set at the three-hour meeting.      Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Secretary of State  Condoleezza Rice accompanied Bush to Camp David. The White  House said no new policy announcements were expected.           BANK EQUITY SHARES      In his weekly Saturday radio address, Bush sought to  reassure Americans the U.S. government had no intention of  becoming a permanent shareholder in private banks.      Bush said the $700 billion rescue package the government  will use to buy equity shares in some banks and purchase some  troubled assets will help get loans flowing to consumers and  businesses.      'Had the government not acted, the hole in our financial  system would have grown larger,' Bush said.      The plan to inject $250 billion in capital into U.S. banks  in exchange for preferred shares has raised concerns about  government interference in the private sector.      Bush sought to allay those fears by saying the government's  involvement would be limited and the goal was to encourage  banks to buy back their shares when markets stabilized.      'The government will not exercise control over any private  firm, and federal officials will not have a seat around your  local bank's boardroom table,' Bush said.      'The shares owned by the government will have voting rights  that can be used only to protect the taxpayer's investment --  not to ",

Bush on  Tuesday said it would be a 'serious mistake' to turn inward as  a result of the global financial crisis and the United States  must stay committed to helping the world's poor.      It was in the security, economic and moral interests of the  United States to promote international development, he said at  a White House summit on international development.      'We meet in the middle of a serious global financial  crisis. Over the past few weeks, we have seen how the world's  economies are more interconnected than ever before,' Bush  said.      'During times of economic crisis, some may be tempted to  turn inward -- focusing on our problems here at home, while  ignoring our interests around the world,' Bush said. 'This  would be a serious mistake.'      Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who spoke earlier at  the conference, said that when times were hard, it was to be  expected that states would focus on protecting their own  interests, but countries must maintain their commitment to  development aid.      'Reneging on our commitments to the world's poor cannot be  an austerity measure,' Rice told representatives of private aid  groups, beneficiary countries and U.S. government officials.      She said she hoped whoever replaces Bush in January, either  Republican John McCain or Democrat Barack Obama, would sustain  the U.S. aid commitment.      Bush said over the weekend that he would host the first in  a series of global financial crisis summits as the world  grapples with the biggest economic crisis since the Great  Depression.      Since the Bush administration came to office in 2001, the  United States had doubled development assistance to Latin  America, quadrupled it to Africa and tripled it world wide,  Rice said.      It also made over $7.5 billion in grants to developing  countries through its Millennium Challenge Corporation  program.

      "Text": "    WASHINGTON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - President George W. Bush,  who will host a global summit on the financial crisis next  month, said on Saturday that agreeing on common principles to  reform regulators would be essential to preventing another  disaster.      His comments came one day after a worldwide sell-off in  stock markets amid growing fears of a global recession.  Friday's session was the lowest closing level for all three  major U.S. stock indexes since the spring of 2003.      'In recent weeks, concerns about the availability of  credit, the safety of financial assets, and the volatility of  the stock market have made many families understandably anxious  about their economic future,' Bush said in his weekly radio  address.      He sought to reassure Americans that the government's  actions to ease the credit crunch were starting to show  results, but said the full impact on the economy would take  time.      The United States will host a summit of global leaders on  Nov. 15 in Washington to discuss the underlying causes of the  crisis and start developing principles of reform for financial  regulators and institutions.      'This crisis is global in reach -- and addressing it will  require further international cooperation,' Bush said.      'While the specific solutions pursued by every country may  not be the same, agreeing on a common set of principles will be  an essential step toward preventing similar crises in the  future,' he said.      Bush warned against taking a protectionist turn in response  to the current financial turbulence, saying free markets and  free trade were fundamental to long-term economic growth.      'These policies have shown themselves time and time again  to be the surest path to creating jobs, increasing commerce,  and fostering progress,' Bush said. 'And this moment of global  economic uncertainty would be precisely the wrong time to  reject such proven methods for creating prosperity and hope.'

      "Text": "    BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Jimmy  Carter said on Friday the 'atrocious economic policies' of the  Bush administration had caused the worst global financial crisis  since the Great Depression of the 1930s.      Carter told reporters on a stopover in Brussels that  'profligate spending', massive borrowing and dramatic tax cuts  since President George W. Bush took office in 2001 were behind  the market turmoil and economic crisis.      'I think it's because of the atrocious economic policies of  the Bush administration,' said the 84-year-old Democrat, who  served in the White House from 1977-1981 during a period of high  inflation and energy crisis.      Whoever wins next month's U.S. presidential election would  inherit economic problems that would force them to postpone  implementing some of their proposed reforms, he said.      'The economic situation is an entrenched problem. It is  going to take years to correct what has been done economically,'  Carter said, adding he hoped Democrat Barrack Obama would win  and immediately improve Washington's image in the world.      Eight years ago, the United States had a budget surplus, low  inflation and a stable, strong economy, he said.      Carter said he was astonished that the United States now  owed China 'in the neighbourhood of $1 trillion'.      Deregulation and what he called a withdrawal of supervision  of Wall Street had encouraged irresponsible elements in the U.S.  financial system, enabling banks to borrow 30 times their value.      Carter was on his way back from a private peace mission to  Cyprus with fellow elder statesmen Lakhdar Brahimi of Algeria  and Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, intended to give a  push to talks between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot  leaders on a settlement to reunite the divided island.

      "Text": " (Adds comments, background.)      By Jeremy Pelofsky      WASHINGTON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President George W.  Bush on Saturday said the financial crisis will require a  global, coordinated response and the top industrial nations  will work together to solve it quickly, but cautioned it would  not be fixed overnight.      'All of us recognize that this is a serious global crisis  and therefore requires a serious global response,' he told  reporters after an unusual Saturday gathering with the Group of  Seven economic chiefs and leaders of the International Monetary  Fund and World Bank.      'I'm confident that the world's major economies can  overcome the challenges we face,' Bush said. He argued the  United States had a leadership role to play to resolve the  crisis.      Credit markets seized up as the U.S. housing market  crumbled over the last year, which sent global stocks  plummeting and forced the Bush administration to take  extraordinary steps to shore up the U.S. financial system.      Bush has insisted the $700 billion bailout package approved  a week ago by the U.S. Congress is adequate to address the  problems but it will take time to implement.      'These extraordinary efforts are being implemented as  quickly and as effectively as possible,' he said, flanked by  the G7 finance ministers as well as key members of his own  Cabinet, including Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.      'The benefits will not be realized overnight, but as these  actions take effect, they will help restore stability to our  markets and confidence to our financial institutions,' Bush  said.      To address the credit crunch, global central banks have cut  lending costs and Washington intervened to offer additional  liquidity to lenders and protect more bank deposits.      The Treasury Department is also working on a plan to take  equity stakes in financial institutions to further boost their  balance sheets, which have been damaged by the housing losses.      Without credit, economic growth will collapse, and  investors have been looking to G7 for a comprehensive plan to  get credit flowing smoothly again.      Bush urged the Group of Seven leading industrial nations to  continue to work collaboratively and coordinate their responses  to help thaw the frozen credit markets, pointing to that  interest rate cut by central banks this week as a good  example.      'As our nations confront challenges unique to our  individual financial systems, we must continue to work  collaboratively and ensure that our actions are coordinated,'  he said.      Bush said the G7 would do what it takes to address the  crisis and praised the work by the group to implement measures  to get credit flowing again and ensure banks could raise money  again.      'As our nations carry out this plan we must ensure the  actions of one country do not contradict or undermine the  actions of another,' Bush said. 'We're in this together, we  will come through it together.'      The G7 finance ministers on Friday, however, stopped short  of endorsing a British proposal to guarantee lending between  banks as another way to get credit flowing again. The G7 is  made up of the United States, Germany, France, Japan, Canada,  Great Britain and Italy.

Bush  will announce on Saturday that the United States will soon host  a summit to discuss the global financial crisis, a senior U.S.  administration official said.      The announcement came as Bush prepared to meet French  President Nicolas Sarkozy -- who has been publicly advocating  for an emergency summit --  and European Commission President  Jose Manuel Barroso at the presidential Camp David presidential  retreat on Saturday.      With the world gripped by the worst financial crisis since  the Great Depression, Sarkozy has called for an overhaul of the  international financial architecture established after World  War II at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference.

Bush  will announce on Saturday that the United States will soon host  a summit to discuss the global financial crisis, a senior U.S.  administration official said.      The announcement came as Bush prepared to meet French  President Nicolas Sarkozy -- who has been publicly advocating  for an emergency summit --  and European Commission President  Jose Manuel Barroso at the Camp David presidential retreat on  Saturday.

Bush said on Friday he was confident world leaders gathering  for a summit would eventually resolve the global financial  crisis and return their economies to a path of growth.      'By working together, I'm confident that with time we can  overcome this crisis and return our economies to the path of  growth and vitality,' Bush said in his weekly radio address, to  air Saturday. The White House released it on Friday ahead of  the G20 summit.      Leaders from G20 countries will attend a dinner at the  White House on Friday evening and hold meetings on Saturday to  discuss the financial crisis.      Bush said he would work with leaders to establish  principles of reform, such as greater market transparency and  ensuring proper regulation of markets, firms and financial  products.      'This is a decisive moment for the global economy,' he  said.      Bush argued against reinventing the system, and said the  solution was to 'fix the problems we face' and adhere to free  market principles.      White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said that the  administration has been supportive of an early warning system  and a college of supervisors for oversight of the world's  biggest financial institutions.      'These are things that we have been supportive of in the  past,' she told reporters.      Bush said the U.S. economy will recover from the current  turmoil. 'In the long run, Americans can be confident in the  future of our economy,' he said.      The 'bold measures' taken by countries around the world in  response to the financial crisis are having an impact as credit  markets start to thaw and businesses gain access to short-term  financing, Bush said.      'It will require more time for these improvements to fully  take hold and there will be more difficult days ahead, but the  United States and our partners are taking the right steps to  get through the crisis,' he said.

      "Text": "    By Kim Dixon      WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate passed an  amendment on Thursday that would bar regulators from requiring  broadcasters to give equal time to all points of view, a ban  strongly supported by some Republican lawmakers.      The legislative amendment, sponsored by Republican Sen. Jim  DeMint of South Carolina, would prevent the Federal  Communications Commission from reimposing the so-called  Fairness Doctrine to all broadcasters. It was repealed more  than 20 years ago.      Aides to President Barack Obama have said he has no  intention of trying to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine, but  that has not stopped some Republicans from raising the issue.      Free Press, a media advocacy group that opposes bringing  back the rule, said the issue was a distraction.      'An uncharitable interpretation is that they (Republicans)  need an issue that unites their base and is an easy talking  point for conservative radio,' said Ben Scott, policy director  at Free Press.      Conservative talk show icon Rush Limbaugh recently decried  the doctrine in a Wall Street Journal editorial.      DeMint said the doctrine violates the First Amendment and  would suppress free speech by letting the government decide  what is fair political dialogue.      An appeals court made that ruling, leading the FCC to  repeal it in 1987.      Scott's group agrees the government should not be decided  what is fair and balanced, but said there is no clamor to bring  it back.      The amendment was attached to an unrelated bill on voting  rights for Washington, D.C. residents. Whether it will survive  in the U.S. House of Representatives is uncertain.

It's your chance to call in and argue with John!\n\nToday John Kerry weighed in on an issue that is now all the rage among liberal politicians. The issue is called the Fairness Doctrine.\n\nThis is a rule that used to exist in broadcasting \u2014 radio and TV \u2014 which required that no opinion could be expressed without a countervailing opinion presented immediately. It was the old salt and pepper rule. If you were on the air with a salt shaker, you had to have a pepper shaker.\n\nNow what this is all about is talk radio. Liberals are complaining that their brand of talk radio fails whenever someone tries to put it on the air, and they have decided the answer is to shut up conservative talk radio. This is the \"Hush Rush\" movement.\n\nLiberals are angry that so many of you listen to talk radio \u2014 conservative talk radio \u2014 and that you cannot be dragged over to a liberal talk show. This argument ignores the fact that something like 20 million people a week listen to NPR, which is the very definition of liberal.\n\nWhat it also ignores is that the Fairness Doctrine applies to all broadcast, not just radio and especially not just talk radio. Liberals should be on notice it will apply to all the liberals who now operate on the airwaves in network TV news, in certain quarters of cable news and, of course, in entertainment TV.\n\nFace it. Liberals own Hollywood. Virtually every movie would be subject to the Fairness Doctrine. Think Al Gore's \"Inconvenient Truth\" could stand up to that scrutiny or Michael Moore's \"Fahrenheit 9/11\"? Not a chance.\n\nDo you think HBO can stand to have the Fairness Doctrine applied to what it airs? Bill Maher is going to have an awful time trying to conform to the Fairness Doctrine, and I can't think of a liberal anywhere who wants to shut him up.\n\nWhat John Kerry and Dianne Feinstein and Dick Durbin are asking for is to only restrict the broadcasting that conservatives do, mainly talk radio, though I have no doubt they have their plans for FOX News, too.\n\nThis is an attempt to take over the airwaves with liberal thought and make sure nothing else gets on. It's already a huge imbalance in favor of liberal thought on the airwaves, and the effort now is to make certain that echo chamber of so-called progressives is undisturbed by any irritating arguments from the right, or debates liberals can't win.\n\nThis is liberals in action. When you can't win the debate, make certain there is no debate. That is what the resurgence of the Fairness Doctrine debate is all about.\n\nThat's My Word.\n\nWatch John Gibson weekdays at 5 p.m. ET on \"The Big Story\" and send your comments to: myword@foxnews.com\n\nRead Your Word",

      "Text": "    NEW DELHI, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The son of a wealthy Indian  arms dealer, whose drunken driving killed six people a decade  ago, was jailed for five years on Friday in a case seen as a test  of Indian courts' fairness in judging the rich and powerful.      Sanjeev Nanda, the grandson of a former navy chief, pleaded  innocent in the case that saw the convict's family being accused  of trying to bribe witnesses into lying.      The media kept up pressure on the high-profile case in a  country where the judiciary is often accused of favouring the  wealthy and powerful.      'I found Sanjeev Nanda guilty,' judge Vinod Kumar said,  sentencing him to five years in prison.      The court also jailed three other defendants for six months  to a year on charges of destroying evidence in the case which  came to be known as the BMW case after the car Nanda was driving.      Nanda's lawyer said they would appeal before a higher court  within a week.      Prosecutors said Nanda, who was a student of the Wharton  School of Business and on holiday in India, was returning from a  party with two friends when he ran over seven people. Six,  including three policemen, were killed.   (Reporting by R.

      "Text": "    TEHRAN, Nov 21 (Reuters) - The head of the U.N. nuclear  watchdog Mohamed ElBaradei should report on Iran's nuclear  programme neutrally and with fairness, an influential cleric  said on Friday after this week's report on Iran's atomic work.      Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, also a former president, said in a  sermon to worshippers at Friday prayers broadcast on state radio  that U.S. accusations that Iran was diverting its nuclear  programme to military purposes were not backed up by evidence.      Washington and its allies accuse Tehran of seeking to build  nuclear warheads under cover of a civilian atomic programme, a  charge Iran denies, insisting its aim is to generate electricity  so it can save more of its vast oil and gas reserves for export.      'We have announced everything. The (International Atomic  Energy) Agency (IAEA) has acknowledged ... that we have had no  diversion,' Rafsanjani said.      'But the Americans have raised a claim that we are not  announcing everything. Well, a claim of this nature has no  limits in scope and anybody can make such a claim in relation to  anything. They are not giving any document to support their  claim.'      The IAEA presented its latest report on Iran on Wednesday,  saying the Islamic Republic planned to start installing another  3,000 centrifuges early next year, adding to 3,800 already  enriching uranium and another 2,200 being gradually introduced.      The West worries about the enrichment programme because it  can have both civilian and military uses.       'As for Mr ElBaradei, whenever he speaks he does it  equivocally ... (saying) that, for instance, Iran is not letting  the agency inspect the Arak heavy water facility,' he said,  referring to one of Iran's disputed nuclear sites.      'This is again an example of trying to use compulsion in  relations to us. We ask the agency to judge neutrally and fairly  and avoid speaking equivocally,' the former president said.      'We will not let the certain right of a revolutionary and  innocent nation be trampled,' Rafsanjani added.      The IAEA has been investigating allegations that Iran  carried out research into nuclear warheads. The accusations were  based on intelligence which came from a laptop computer spirited  out of Iran by a defector in 2004 and passed on to Washington,  from some other Western states, and from IAEA inquiries.      Iran dismisses the allegations and says U.N. inspectors have  access in line with legal requirements to verify what it says is  the peaceful nature of the Islamic Republic's plans.

      "Text": "First radio, now the Web?\n\nMedia analysts and bloggers are warning that fresh efforts to bring back the so-called Fairness Doctrine could go too far, following a report that one prominent Democrat is looking into ways to apply the media control standards to the Internet.\n\nThe Fairness Doctrine is a policy created decades ago but abolished in the late 1980s that required broadcasters to provide opposing views on controversial issues.\n\nWhile some Democrats have talked about reviving the policy, The American Spectator reported Monday that Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., is taking the call to a new level. The article said aides to the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee met last week with Federal Communications Commission staff to discuss ways to not only enact those policies but give Waxman's panel greater oversight over the Internet.\n\n\"It's all about diversity in media,\" the Spectator quoted a House energy committee staff member as saying. \"Does one radio station or one station group control four of the five most powerful outlets in one community? ... Does one heavily trafficked Internet site present one side of an issue and not link to sites that present alternative views?\"\n\nThe committee vigorously denied the report. A spokesperson called the account \"fictitious\" in a statement to FOX News.\n\n\"The American Spectator report is false and was written without any documentation or attribution,\" the statement said.\n\nFCC spokesman David Fiske also disputed the claims in the piece, saying, \"We're not sure that it's an accurate article.\"\n\nAnalysts treated the report with a dose of skepticism as well -- but noted that the idea is not entirely foreign. Robert McDowell, the current FCC commissioner and a Bush appointee, warned in an interview last year that Fairness Doctrine advocates might try to extend their policies to the Web.\n\nIf that is the case, foes and supporters of the doctrine alike say policing fairness on the Internet will prove impossible. Plus they say it's unnecessary and well beyond the scope of the original policy.\n\n\"This borders between stupidity and sheer insanity,\" said conservative radio talk show host Mike Gallagher, when told about the Spectator report. \"I can't wait until they try to monitor how many conservative posts are on a thread versus how many liberal posts are on a thread.\"\n\nHe added that Democrats would be only neutralizing dominant liberal blogs that currently help them. He predicted any move to extend Fairness Doctrine principles to the Web would \"blow sky high.\"\n\nThe Fairness Doctrine was adopted in 1949 and held that broadcasters were obligated to provide opposing points of views on controversial issues of national importance. It was halted under the Reagan administration.\n\nThe policy is the scourge of conservative radio hosts, who say it would allow the federal government to skew content on their programs. Democratic lawmakers, some of whom have renewed the call to reinstate the doctrine in recent weeks, say it would bring accountability to the airwaves and help increase the number of liberal shows in a landscape dominated by conservatives like Rush Limbaugh.\n\nSteve Rendall, a Fairness Doctrine supporter and senior analyst with Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, said liberals and conservatives both over-state the impact the doctrine would have on media content.\n\nHe said most talk shows, even those on the right, already comply with the requirements, which he said tread \"very lightly\" and do not call for absolute balance on the airwaves.\n\nBut he said there is \"no justification\" for applying the doctrine to the Internet, or any other form of media -- since the doctrine was only meant to apply standards to the privileged holders of limited broadcast licenses. The Internet, by contrast, has infinite outlets for opinion.\n\n\"Cable and Internet are, at least theoretically, limitless in the number of voices that they can present, and it's not at all the same as broadcast,\" Rendall said.\n\nBrent Bozell, president of the conservative Media Research Center, said it would be \"impossible\" to regulate balance and neutrality on the Internet. He said he thinks Democrats eventually want to bring those standards to the Web but are struggling to rally the political will to revisit the Fairness Doctrine.\n\nHe said any legislative efforts to reinstate it will probably occur behind closed doors, since doing it out in the open could cause political repercussions.\n\nThe Spectator reported that Waxman's advisers were discussing ways to implement Fairness Doctrine policies without actually calling it the \"Fairness Doctrine.\"\n\nOther Democrats have openly called for a modern-day Fairness Doctrine in recent weeks, though they were referring more to radio than the Internet.\n\n\"I absolutely think it's time to be bringing accountability to the airwaves,\" Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., told liberal radio host Bill Press two weeks ago. She said she expects hearings soon on reviving the policy, though her office has reportedly backed off that prediction. (Stabenow's husband, Tom Athans, is and has been an executive at several liberal radio talk groups.)\n\nAnd Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, told Press last week: \"We gotta get the Fairness Doctrine back in law again.\"\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, a spokesman said then-candidate Barack Obama did not favor reinstating the Fairness Doctrine. But Obama's White House aides are now leaving open the question.\n\nAsked if the White House would rule out imposing the doctrine on \"FOX News Sunday,\" senior adviser David Axelrod ducked.\n\n\"I'm going to leave that issue to Julius Genachowski, our new head of the FCC ... and the president to discuss. So I don't have an answer for you now,\" he said.\n\nDespite the speculation, nobody has introduced a bill this session to reinstate those policies.\n\nMeanwhile, Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe introduced a bill this year to prevent reinstatement of the Fairness Doctrine.\n\nFOXNews.com's Judson Berger and FOX News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",
